One problem front still much producers want charge state electricity. reported last week, Davis aides want pay around $50 $55 dollars per megawatt hour suppliers want $75. Treasury Secretary Summers suggested auction best way determine price, California officials taking less free market approach still hope set price negotiation long-term contracts. sources Washington, Sacramento, California increasingly view Governor Davis positioning government establish long-term power contracts generators could passed utilities following bankruptcy near term. week's legislative activities Sacramento create vehicle so. State credit backing purchases power would obviate need super-priority borrowing finance power purchases utility bankruptcy. 1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships California officials also toughened rhetoric debt repayment front say results preliminary audit show half $9 $12 billion utilities say owe actually owed power bought corporate relations strange situation due fact one holding company owns power-generating power-distributing companies holding company umbrella. course, means power PG&E Southern California Edison bought highly inflated prices bought themselves. bad news tense negotiations.

Davis' laid meeting, use forbearance period securitize debts sell utilities' forward rate base establishing medium-term repayment plan backed continued state guarantees. cases restructured debt would resolved decade without direct use taxpayer money utilities use positive margins paydown debt. One reasons Davis wants stay close $50-$55 megawatt charge maximizes rate utilities pay debt. strong chance Davis agree use state guarantees sweeten pot end negotiations, remains opposed using direct state money. frustrates Clinton administration utility creditors, Davis yet shown much flexibility. 3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation Perhaps frustrating Washington DC free market crowd Treasury White House continued comfort Davis group political advisers "non-market" solutions energy crisis. Although Governor's aides actually believe "way force eventual agreement, actual solution," talk returns frequently non-market mechanisms. "We ultimate weapon enforce compliance Tuesday deadline. make progress. thing looks like turn genuine crisis, use powers condemnation re-take plants equipment run ourselves," close political aide Davis said.

Calgary Powerex Corp. Vancouver earlier year part investigation suspected electricity price fixing two companies, according documents obtained Dow Jones Newswires. Bureau investigator David Bloom application warrant used gain access offices summer 1999, Powerex Enron coordinating bid restatements inflating price received electricity Power Pool Alberta. investigation yet produced charges either companies, according Enron. Competition Bureau declined comment status Enron Corp. (ENE), owns Enron Canada, Powerex, unit provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny breaking rules laws. Powerex's point view, Albertans looking someone blame high power prices, become political issue province. "They find easy blame us pretty fundamental market design flaws," Powerex president chief executive Ken told Dow Jones Newswires interview. Deregulation Spurs Search Someone Blame search someone blame repeated across every deregulating market Enron participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said. "Almost every time either power markets natural gas markets even oil markets gasoline markets experienced kind price volatility, investigations done," Palmer said. Enron scrutinized part wider energy markets investigations, said, never found breaking rules. first investigation Powerex's actions, Peterson said. Competition Bureau, based say whether investigaion ongoing, citing disclosure rules Competition Act. companies said they're sure investigation's status. seized files returned several months ago, Powerex heard Bureau since then. Enron receive call Bureau last week question, according Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode. investigation began Power Pool Alberta's system controllers noticed clearing price megawatt electricity topping C$100 unusual frequency. Pool's price set participants submitting bids buy sell power following day. Oct. 19, 1999, bidder could restate amount power bid offer unlimited number times, 20 minutes hour transmission. price paid megawatt power needed Pool given hour set expensive unit needed meet demand. Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed According Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex Enron rigging bids following manner: Powerex would lower volume existing offer. little two minutes later, Enron would increase offer period volume, "significantly higher price," warrant application. Sometimes, Enron would increase offer even Powerex dropped offer. Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, worked Enron Canada's gas trading group, found "as result restatements, involving mostly Powerex Enron," Pool price raised C$200/MWh, four times C$354.29 C$499.93, three times C$500 C$541.63, 10 times C$801.02 C$998. Based restatement patterns, Craig, Bureau's Bloom, concluded new energy offered Pool. believed power transferred Powerex Enron offered higher price, warrant application. cutting volume offered Powerex, expensive power offered Enron likely needed, every participant would get higher price. Powerex's Peterson take issue trade history detailed Bureau, denies company's traders anything wrong two companies sort arrangement. "And we're adamant that," Peterson said. "There deal Enron. expectation behavior would lead terms change prices anything like that." Powerex traders merely locking price, cutting company's risk, Enron agreed take buying power fixed price, Peterson said. "Whenever Enron's offer high-priced energy declined, within moments Enron advised Pool energy would required, Powerex would restate identical volume energy back lower priced unit," according warrant application. Peterson's response: "We're operating tight market felt obligation make sure power got delivered Alberta." Enron also denies broke Power Pool rules Canadian laws. "It boils offered power price lower thought could sell at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's Enron every company that's business trading." May 25 search warrant covers companies' actions June 1, 1999, Oct. 19, 1999. Oct. 20, 1999, Pool changed restatement rules, essentially closing loophole, though without ever making public investigation Powerex Enron. Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined discuss details investigation. "Market surveillance place to, among things, protect interests activities market participants," said. convicted Canadian law bid-rigging fined amount court's discretion and/or jailed five years. conviction likely affect Powerex's ability trade U.S., Peterson said. Canada "there would follow-on action Alberta parties inhibit that. far, still like get power." Companies Concerned Reputations bigger problem, Peterson said, case Powerex reputation. companies concerned lot stake reputational point view," Peterson said. "Both companies, believe, conduct highest possible standard. difficult times business prices going crazy Alberta California people looking somebody blame. There's always possibility collateral damage politics gets involved." Powerex parent company BC Hydro also suspected Power Pool Alberta unfairly providing access transmission British Columbia, linking Washington Alberta, detailed Oct. 13 Power Pool market surveillance report.

That's bad, lost truths humorous, others enlightening. year began California State Senator Steve Peace, one chief architects 1996 deregulation law, boasting fooled merchant power companies paying much power plants bought state's utilities. deregulation law "a bet industry nationwide would misperceive overbid power plants," said Peace, reported Intelligence Press January. "When California legislature entered debate electricity competition," Peace went say January, "the assumption accept level compromise reliability. fundamentally different did, compared national debate, said absolutely, categorically cannot compromise reliability. led reliability." Now, course, view things laughable. late June even, Peace foaming mouth California Independent System Operator new power plant owners gouging state. demanded - eventually got - ISO board governors cut price cap $250 megawatt-hour $750/MWh. record, ISO's lower price cap complete failure. price cap protect state's utilities financial ruin, contributed losses. week 4, western U.S. wholesale power markets well $250/MWh, ISO staff buying massive amounts juice average price $700/MWh "out-of-market" purchases allowed price cap rule, publicly reported. ISO staff allowed make out-of-market purchases utilities outside California. California's independent power producers selling out-of-state utilities $400-$500/MWh, utilities selling power back ISO $1,100/MWh. Northwest even started buying power plants PG&E Corp. (PCG) Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison still California Power Exchange's day-ahead market $250/MWh, selling back utilities ISO's real-time market $700/MWh. pretty cheeky, market participants always take advantage rules make big profit. point, ISO asked U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permission dispense failed price cap move FERC-recommended "soft" price cap, requires sellers document costs justify power sold $150/MWh.

CPUC California Gov. Gray Davis talk "a five-fold increase" prices FERC lifted price cap, talking clearing price index $1,407.07 Dec. 13. CalPX went record calling clearing price "meaningless." result computer problem instituting new "soft" price cap rules. electricity bought sold price California day, hours later prices refigured $250-$310/MWh. over-the-counter market drifted $450-$500/MWh Northwest $320-$350/MWh Southwest. prices drifting since.

"I think everything table," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton told reporters. avoid huge spikes electricity prices likely hottest issue facing Legislature prepares 2001 session. Electricity bills tripled rate deregulation plan approved Legislature 1996 kicked year customers San Diego Gas Electric Co. California's two huge investor-owned utilities, Southern California Edison Pacific Gas & Electric Co., say suffered $5 billion $6 billion losses increases wholesale electricity prices they've waited deregulation fully affect them. may ask Legislature permission raise rates make losses can't get authorization Public Utilities Commission courts. Burton questioned whether utilities lost much. "I know they've got problems, like baseball teams saying lose money," San Francisco Democrat said. "Well, lose money cause depreciate Alex Rodriguez's $20 million contact. ain't losing money making money." PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Burton raised "legitimate questions" said company's losses real. "The fact cannot continue keep borrowing money pay high wholesale prices," Low said. "We filed reports commission month detail seriousness situation." Burton said PUC needs audit utility company books. "If running broke who's responsibility bail out: state, ratepayers, share holders?" Burton asked. "Those easy questions answer." said consumer advocates believe utility stock holders eat losses utilities believe customers pay cover them. "Maybe something between," Burton said. Asked taxpayers chip in, said one possible way try hold prices would develop power generation systems would fully partially owned public. "Public power around years," said. "It worked years." Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director Independent Energy Producers, association privately owned power plant companies, said there's need build publicly owned facilities. "Energy coming California...," said, adding five power plants construction state now. "Getting market back track require massive amounts legislation." Another option re-regulate utility rates, Burton said. "I never found burden think burden ratepayers," said. lawmakers fail solve problem, consumer advocates put public power system initiative ballot pass overwhelmingly, Burton predicted. Spokesmen power generators utilities immediately respond request Associated Press comment.

However, continued quibble create set data points would inputs testing process. Last week consulting arm "Big Five" accounting firm indicated following method proposed us would acceptable. believe method overcomes statistical problems arise using interest rate differences overlapping ("rolling") quarters. Method: 1)Calculate daily yield curve changes expressed ratios, using historical rates recent, say, two years. (Note: overlap). results set around 494 vectors ratios (approximately 247 trading days per year). Example: first three yield curves historical set look like this: 19980801 6.5 6.6 6.7 ......... 7.2 19980802 6.3 6.3 6.6 ......... 6.9 19980803 6.6 6.8 6.9 ......... 7.1 change 8/1/98 8/2/98 is: 6.3/6.5 6.3/6.6 6.6/6.7 .......... 6.9/7.1 change 8/2/98 8/3/98 is: 6.6/6.3 6.8/6.3 6.9/6.6 ......... 7.1/6.9 2)Randomly select 62 "ratio" vectors (approx. 62 trading days quarter). 3)Multiply ratio vectors together get single vector (ie, 62 6mo ratios multiplied together, 62 1yr ratios multiplied togeter, etc.). result represents single quarterly yield curve transformation. Apply "today's" yield curve. resulting yield curve represents one simulated quarterly change interest rates 4)Repeat steps 2 3 adequate number yield curves generated, say 100. 5) Proceed testing process. would interested comments.

Power plant owners refused sell electricity Pacific Gas & Electric Southern California Edison, state's two biggest utilities, nearly drained cash eight months soaring wholesale power prices prevented state raising rates consumers. ˜˜Four private energy companies warning would take two utilities Bankruptcy Court next day state begin pick bill electricity. ˜˜Faced options rationing power, shocking California's economy tripling electricity rates opening state's checkbook, grim-faced Gov. Gray Davis signed emergency decree allow Department Water Resources use budget buy electricity would sold consumers. ˜˜That act, later broadened formalized Legislature, opened door taxpayer money--$8 billion counting--to used buy electricity. ˜˜"It's obligation provide power homes businesses drive California," Davis said time. "I'm disappointed utilities can't it. choice step in, it." ˜˜The involvement state buying power changed political calculations involved setting electricity rates. months, private utilities complained California's rates, frozen part state's deregulation law, lower cost buying power. raising rates help utilities politically unpalatable; Public Utilities Commission January gave fraction sought raising rates PG&E Edison residential customers 9%. ˜˜After state began buying power, though, California's treasury risk.

Cooler-than-expected weather lowered demand even more. Californians used 12% less electricity last month June 2000, adjusting weather economic growth, according California Energy Commission. ˜˜Seven months state began buying power, January's sense urgency dissipated.

Grumbling grows louder deeply state inserted electricity business. ˜˜It "huge mistake" let Department Water Resources become buyer electricity used California, said Bill Booth, attorney California Large Energy Consumers Assn., group heavy industry manufacturers pushed hard deregulation early 1990s. ˜˜"I would hope state entity chooses get role sooner rather later," Booth said. "The state shown zero capability well," said, voicing criticism also made Republican lawmakers. ˜˜Davis advisors argue little choice jump buy power behalf utilities. insist intervention stabilized market. ˜˜Long-Term Contracts Called 'Insurance' ˜˜After state government began buying electricity, officials moved quickly get state exorbitant spot market locking $43-billion worth long-term power contracts, lasting decade. Lawmakers consumer advocates growing increasingly critical contracts, expensive falling prices spot market. ˜˜But Davis administration officials insist spot market prices falling state buying 40% power contract, rather bidding prices seeking electricity market. ˜˜"Insurance insurance, costs little bit, damned good thing have," said S. David Freeman, governor's top energy advisor former general manager Los Angeles Department Water Power. ˜˜"The people ballgame criticize long-term contracts criticize anything stability God forbid may turn cost tiny bit spot market future," Freeman added. "That kind thinking leads spot market." ˜˜The shift spot market factor stabilized situation, however, accuse governor taking undue credit. ˜˜The change "clearly explained fundamentals supply, increased, demand, decreased people conserving," said Gary Ackerman, executive director Western Power Trading Forum, group electricity sellers. ˜˜The price natural gas, fuel used run California's power plants, fallen half since early January. widespread disagreement why--mirroring argument gas prices spiked first place. ˜˜When prices rose, electricity companies accused gas pipeline companies gouging. gas firms said power generators bid price knowing could recoup cost selling expensive megawatts. ˜˜Another factor lowering wholesale electricity prices state's overall power supplies abundant many power plants shut spring running again. ˜˜At times last winter, 10,000 megawatts capacity offline. Recent plant shutdowns totaled closer 4,000 megawatts. Three new power plants opened summer, adding 1,415 megawatts state's capacity. ˜˜Statewide demand electricity peaking little 30,000 megawatts recent days. ˜˜Again, reasons additional supply disputed. Generating companies say plants shut earlier year repairs maintenance. ˜˜State officials consumer advocates alleged plants taken offline manipulate prices. Today, less power bought spot market, fewer incentives manipulation. ˜˜A federal wholesale electricity price cap took effect June also also dampened prices, experts say. ˜˜The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed cap, $92 per megawatt-hour, resisting pleas California politicians nearly year. ˜˜"They complete 180," said Severin Borenstein, director University California Energy Institute Berkeley, "and done earlier, would saved lot money." ˜˜The agency manages state's transmission grid found bids power sellers dropped June 21, price limit took effect. assessing much change resulted cap much factors "is difficult," said Anjali Sheffrin, director market analysis California Independent System Operator. ˜˜The changes market--and debate administration critics--involve pays risk. ˜˜Little Incentive Firms Trim Costs ˜˜Before deregulation 1998, California's electricity industry designed avoid risk shortages.

Rick works company called Amerimex. Rick worked together gas supply EPNG ("the early years"). Amerimex developer "trigeneration" projects. addition subject project Bloomfield, another one considered Santa Theresa, N.M. recall, introduced trigeneration discussing electric generation plant site hydroponic tomato greenhouse near Gallup. Trigeneration environmentally friendly technology utilizes "byproducts" electric generation. "Cogeneration" refers process waste heat/steam generated combustion gas turbines sold commercially (usually manufacturing facilities) plant purposes. "Trigeneration," hand, refers process waste heat/steam utilized, also dioxide. Therefore, trigeneration perfect fit greenhouse requires heat carbon dioxide plants. Amerimex proposed hydroponic lettuce greenhouse Bloomfield, N.M. area. facility, constructed turnkey United Technologies, would nominal rating 70 MW, resulting gas burn 15 plant would require gas deliveries approx. 500 psig. outtake power would sold locally grid using TriStates 69kv transmission line proximate site.

Food beverage firms also viewed prime targets could use weather derivatives manage cashflows better. companies need hedges since weather increase decrease firm's sales dramatically. Food beverage firms typically benefit warm weather, occasion, food chain, example, enjoy increased sales cold spells weather extreme enough keep customers indoors. firms beginning ask questions "If there's going really hot summer, affect bottom-line? systematic weather risk going cost summer?" adds Cameron Rookley, financial economist Caminus.

UK building societies' use credit derivatives limited IFR - May 19, 2001 Jean Haggerty UK Treasury's legislation allowing building societies use credit derivatives protect assets borrower default may fail societies credit derivatives market. Initial hopes Treasury's move fortnight ago would prompt societies embrace synthetic securitisations - thus help fuel credit derivative market growth. closer examination, hopes seem fading. "It unlikely big market. building societies remaining. Also, assets suitable synthetic securitisation relatively small," said Chris Carman, vice-president within JP Morgan's structured products group London. Building societies' mortgage assets predominantly owner-occupied residential mortgages, such, 50% capital weighting Bank International Settlement purposes. "This weighting means hold least 4% capital asset. So, synthetic securitisation would take capital weighting 20%. deal would produce limited capital savings," Carman said. also means that, unlike banks large proportion 100% weighted assets, building societies limited incentive seek regulatory capital relief via transaction, said Simon Gleeson, partner solicitors Allen & Overy London. mutual societies, also pressure improve return equity, noted. smaller building societies may candidates synthetic securitisations cheaper require less documentation traditional securitisations, others may concentrations large enough warrant use synthetic securitisations. smaller building societies may viable candidates synthetic securitisations, may able build infrastructure required otherwise actively trade credit derivatives, noted Janet Tavakoli, executive director head structuring engineering credit derivatives WestLB London. Building societies would need securitising asset pool E500m warrant entering transaction cost putting together transactions quite sizeable, industry officials said.

Therefore, issuing vanilla debt easier synthetic securitisations," said. rapid growth credit derivatives market spurred increase synthetic securitisations. British Bankers Association (BBA) last summer projected credit derivatives market would reach US$1.5trn (notional outstanding) 2002. 1997, synthetic securitisations used method mitigating risks, BBA estimated credit derivatives market roughly US$180bn. Building societies likely use synthetic securitisations new product areas way transfer risk related new product transferring risk higher-weighted assets, industry officials said. Buy-to-let mortgages might prove area ripe synthetic securitisation 100% weighted UK, said JP Morgan's Carman. "Building societies could also look [synthetically] securitise commercial lending," added. this, too, would need hold 8% regulatory capital, said. changes enabling building societies use credit derivatives occurred BSC's regulatory jurisdiction building societies transferred FSA November.

California Energy Commission calculates average 14,990 megawatts generating capacity, nearly third state's total, unavailable day April plant shutdowns, four times much year ago. shutdowns subject increasing scrutiny California enters another period high demand, warm spring summer months May September, electricity normally grows third. Loretta Lynch, president California Public Utilities Commission, said last week agency found considerable evidence suspicious plant shutdowns. California Independent System Operator, manages state's power grid, says plant shutdowns become primary means constricting supply. extensive investigation Chronicle found generators shut boost prices "gaming" tactics contributed plants' deteriorating condition. "We suspected it," said Jim MacIntosh, manager grid operations ISO. "It sure factor driving prices." swings unit output, said, "would make sense scenario they're trying game something. Otherwise, would that? They're tearing units up." Unusual phone calls Operators San Bernardino County power plant owned Reliant Energy Inc. say complex plan manipulate California energy market began early last year series unusual telephone calls headquarters Houston. According accounts three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers energy trading floor ordered repeatedly decrease, increase output 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. happened many four five times hour. time units ramped electricity production fell, plant employees watched control room computer screen spot market energy prices rose. came phone call ramp units back up. "They would tell us do, would it," said one men, agreed speak condition identified fear fired. "Afterward, would sit watch market change." workers said frequent large swings electricity output began number California power plants state's power crisis began earnest. workers state power authorities assert swings one primary means gaming wholesale energy market. "It appears control rooms responsive direction trading floors Houston, rather reliability needs ISO," said Carl Wood, commissioner commission overseeing agency's investigation plant outages. "Instead responsive demands reliability, they're responsive profitability." Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using tactic mechanism game California energy power including AES Corp. partnership NRG Energy Inc. Dynegy Inc., asserted skyrocketing electricity demand forced run aging, decrepit power plants harder ever meet California's needs. acknowledging company issued changes output levels frequently every 10 minutes, company officials said done instructions ISO maintain supply-demand balance. "As part routinely business within California California market design, required that," said Kevin Frankeny, operations official Reliant. "When ISO (issues dispatch orders), dispatch 10-minute basis. go many times within hour." Frankeny said aware instances Reliant schedulers Houston ordered dispatch changes without ISO directing first. ISO refused comment operations specific facility, Stephanie McCorkle, ISO spokeswoman, said ramping tactics used beyond dispatch instructions periods tight supply. plant operators said orders vary output came independently grid managers. "ISO calling Reliant every 10 minutes that," said one operators. "Not individual unit." Officials California attorney general's declined legality ramping citing continuing investigation whether energy prices manipulated. One source familiar state various inquiries said ramping, proved done drive prices, could violate state's unfair business practices laws. Invisible practice could companies Reliant tinker output get caught? One plant workers said practice designed virtually invisible regulators grid operators. power companies bid hourly contracts, agree produce certain amount electricity given hour. Generators paid based average spot market prices hour. driving spot price, increase hourly profits still produce total amount energy required. plant worker said units would ramped immediately output measurement, performed top hour ISO. Then, said, brought back spot market price electricity rose response reduced output. time ISO measured again, output back expected level. Another operator said units always ramped - price reached satisfactory level, generators would raise output remain level long price right. times, price low, output brought kept down. operator said amount ramping appeared matter individual company schedulers Houston, aggressive others. "What would do, especially late night, price tanked, would undergenerate," operator said. "Then, mysteriously, price would go up. "Then, schedule 70 (required megawatt hours output), they'd say, 'Go 90.' would cause price tank. they'd say, 'Bring again.' Rapid fluctuations occurred within time spans little 15 minutes, operators said. acceptable rates bringing unit minimum maximum levels plant owned Southern California Edison like 80 minutes, avoid stressing machinery, one workers said. Moreover, typically run constant levels, also reduced wear tear. "They basically ramping fast can, slamming brakes on," said "They increasing fatigue units." ISO officials say changed market operations last fall crack gaming tactics, including instituting so-called 10-minute market, rather hourly market, could easily detected companies withholding power. ISO says generator outages become primary tactic driving energy prices. computer analysis Chronicle shutdown data recent 39-day period shows Reliant three generating companies topped list plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented largest amount wattage lost among companies. Plants owned Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. Duke Energy Inc. accounted half state's unplanned shutdowns, even though generating capacity 25 percent state's total capacity sources. Reliant, one California's largest profitable out-of-state generators, reported 319 shutdowns period March April. followed Mirant Corp. Atlanta (310), AES Corp. Arlington, Va. (278) Duke Energy North America Charlotte, N.C. (261). Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived system 53,000 megawatts 40-day period, average 1,368 per day - enough power 1.4 million homes one hour. Ormond Beach plant Oxnard, one generating unit 26 days, accounted 30,000 missed megawatts. However, operator worked plant said outages appeared result legitimate equipment failures. Reliant says valid reasons plants need repair. old: 48, Etiwanda oldest Reliant's five California plants. company says routine maintenance deferred plants could remain service times high summer demand. operators said issue clear-cut. One problem Etiwanda, tube leak, present month previously reported management, said, deteriorated much, operating full capacity immediate need take unit offline problem. Moreover, time shutdown, ISO expressly asked Reliant keep unit online, operators said. Richard Wheatley, spokesman Reliant, denied Reliant unit taken offline unnecessary maintenance. Ramping may rampant Sources say Reliant alone using ramping practice. source familiar state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. operator worked El Segundo plant co-owned NRG Dynegy said practice used there, although less frequently. scheduling calls came trading floor Houston, rather NRG Minneapolis, said. Steve Stengel, Dynegy, said changes output El Segundo normal changing levels throughout day, denied company engaged gaming California market.

Method: 1)Calculate daily yield curve changes expressed ratios, using historical rates recent, say, two years. (Note: overlap). set around 494 vectors ratios (approximately 247 trading days per year). Example: first yield curves historical set look like this: 19980801 6.5 6.6 6.7 ......... 7.2 19980802 6.3 6.3 6.6 ......... 6.9 19980803 6.6 6.8 6.9 ......... 7.1 change 8/1/98 8/2/98 is: 6.3/6.5 6.3/6.6 6.6/6.7 .......... 6.9/7.1 change 8/2/98 8/3/98 is: 6.6/6.3 6.8/6.3 6.9/6.6 ......... 7.1/6.9 2)Randomly select 62 "ratio" vectors (approx. 62 trading days quarter). 3)Multiply ratio vectors together get single vector (ie, 62 6mo ratios multiplied together, 62 1yr ratios multiplied togeter, etc.). result represents single quarterly yield curve transformation. Apply "today's" yield curve. resulting yield curve represents one simulated quarterly change interest rates 4)Repeat steps 2 3 adequate number yield generated, say 100. 5) Proceed testing process. would interested comments.

JULIE TAMAKI, Times Staff Writer SACRAMENTO--The rolling blackouts swept California Monday sparked part crucial group small energy producers cut supplies state's utilities paid. California's power supply dropped Monday alternative producers reduced output went offline, cutting usual deliveries utilities half. lost electricity--more seven times cuts companies making weeks ago--could served 3 million homes. "I think we're getting breaking point many businesses," said Ed Tomeo, president UAE Energy Operations Corp., San Ramon company operates biomass plant small gas-fired plant. Tomeo said expects take gas-fired plant offline today he's run money buy natural gas. Tomeo's firm among nearly 700 alternative energy producers generate fourth power consumed California. Collectively, group estimates owed $1.5 billion state's two largest utilities. Big out-of-state power producers getting paid state stepped buy electricity foundering utilities. California producers solar, wind biomass energy and, typically, smaller gas-fired generators, received payments since November Southern California Edison partial payments Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

Jim Detmers, director California Independent System Operator, agency operates state's power grid, said Monday's shortfall alternative producers mostly caused reduced output dozen companies cutting back electricity deliveries past two months. Detmers said could say whether action orchestrated, appeared business decision. cuts grown 400 megawatts day early February 3,000 megawatts last several days, according state officials. Assemblyman Fred Keeley, Boulder Creek Democrat, said blame small producers, formally referred "qualifying facilities," shutting down. "Although feel unfortunate consumers, blame [them] all," Keeley said. "They're ones generating electricity getting paid." Keeley said revive efforts legislation would ensure alternative energy producers get paid cutting rates. previous effort slash rates paid group, SB 47X Keeley Sen. Jim (R-La Quinta), appears doomed. Gov. Gray Davis huddled two hours Democratic legislative leaders Monday, keeping distance several weeks, agreement emerged give small generators choice: Take higher price exchange short-term commitments buy power, accept lower price exchange multiyear commitment buy sources attended meeting said. governor Legislature would quickly devise way ensure producers start getting paid, least power continue produce. long utilities collecting money customers, Davis later told labor group, "they're going make payments." alternative producers' rates pegged price natural gas, skyrocketed recent months. prices critical factor Davis' overall plan buying power without imposing additional consumer rate hikes. growing number unpaid producers dropped offline, state officials forced purchase replacement supplies pricey spot market. worst-case scenario materialized Monday, lack electricity supplies forced state officials order blackouts. "A number plants maintenance, clear significant due nonpayment," said Smutny-Jones, executive director Independent Energy Producers. "My concern prelude we'll see summer." PG&E spokesman John Nelson described alternative producers victims state's energy meltdown. "Many generators relatively small enterprises cannot afford continue operating daily basis."

"With new resources coming on-line new conservation measures taking effect, next summer looks better expected, manage resources properly," said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive Director. study, prepared part response legislation enacted September, quantified amount electricity demand supply expected summer 2001. "We produced analysis ground up," commented Larson. "We looked every power plant source electricity available State give us realistic appraisal stand next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak electricity demand using three temperature scenarios." analysis indicated "most likely" temperature conditions, next year's electricity peak demand 47,266 megawatts, reflects reduction 220 megawatts demand new utility state energy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add additional 2,200 3,000 megawatts demand order provide 7 percent margin, raising generation needed minimum 50,303 megawatts. California experiences warmer normal summer, electricity system require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements, raises total 51,882 megawatts. scenario, total expected resources 52,550 megawatts. State experience extremely hot temperatures, 1-in-10 year likelihood occurring, 53,104 megawatts needed (50,068 megawatts demand plus operating reserve requirements), expected resources 52,190 megawatts. additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts potential generation currently development may available part summer. Energy Commission's demand forecast takes consideration expected economic conditions household growth State. two factors influence demand air conditioning drives summer peak demand electricity. Energy Commission's staff supply outlook includes existing in-state out-of-state generation; new power plants expected on-line generating electricity August 1, 2000; electricity imports exports. supply outlook also includes new renewable energy projects energy efficiency measures initiatives made possible funding AB 970, approved Governor September, 2000.

CEC symposium take place San Diego 29-30 November, bring together leading experts industry, academia, NGOs governments Canada, Mexico United States consider impact evolving continental electricity market human health environment. "Our goal [with working symposium] highlight key environmental issues must addressed electricity markets North America become integrated," said Janine Ferretti, executive director CEC. "We want stimulate discussion around important policy questions countries cooperate approach energy environment." CEC, international organization created environmental side agreement NAFTA known North American Agreement Environmental Cooperation, established address regional environmental concerns, help prevent potential trade environmental conflicts, promote effective enforcement environmental law. CEC Secretariat believes greater North American cooperation environmental policies regarding continental electricity market necessary to: * protect air quality mitigate climate change, * minimize possibility environment-based trade disputes, * ensure dependable supply reasonably priced electricity across North America * avoid creation pollution havens, * ensure local national environmental measures remain effective. Changing Market working paper profiles rapid changing North American electricity market. example, 2001, US projected export 13.1 thousand (GWh) electricity Canada Mexico. 2007, number projected grow 16.9 thousand GWh electricity. "Over past decades, North American electricity market developed complex array cross-border transactions relationships," said Phil Sharp, former US congressman chairman Electricity Advisory Board. "We need achieve new level cooperation environmental approaches well." Environmental Profile Electricity Sector electricity sector largest source nationally reported toxins United States Canada large source Mexico. US, electricity sector emits approximately 25 percent NOx emissions, roughly 35 percent CO2 emissions, 25 percent mercury emissions almost 70 percent SO2 emissions. emissions large impact watersheds migratory species corridors often shared three North American countries. "We want discuss possible outcomes greater efforts coordinate federal, state provincial environmental laws policies relate electricity sector," said Ferretti. "How develop compatible environmental approaches help make domestic environmental policies effective?" Effects Integrated Electricity Market One key issue raised paper effect market integration competitiveness particular fuels coal, natural gas renewables. Fuel choice largely determines environmental impacts specific facility, along pollution control technologies, performance standards regulations. paper highlights impacts highly competitive market well. example, concerns called "pollution havens" arise significant differences environmental laws enforcement practices induce power companies locate operations jurisdictions lower standards. "The CEC Secretariat exploring additional environmental policies work restructured market policies adapted ensure enhance competitiveness benefit entire region," said Sharp. trade rules policy measures directly influence variables drive successfully integrated North American electricity market, working paper also addresses fuel choice, technology, pollution control strategies subsidies.

[IMAGE] IssueAlert March 21, 2001 Dissension FERC: Commission Divided Price Caps, Future Leadership McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis [News item Reuters, March 20] Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said remained divided whether impose temporary cap wholesale prices western United States prevent summer blackouts price spikes. three FERC commissioners, regulate interstate electricity markets, testified House Representatives Energy Air subcommittee hearing California braced another day blackouts. Since start deregulation early 1990s, FERC's various positions competition unfold across country fairly consistent. Despite changing members, whole five-member (with two positions currently open) taken "hands-off" approach regulatory role, preferring instead allow free market forces drive competition energy industry. fact, Curt H,bert, appointed FERC chairman January President Bush, told interview tenure commissioner envisioned time FERC would step regulatory role altogether. However, significant structural philosophical changes within FERC surfaced since January, dovetailing departure former chairman James Hoecker. federal regulatory body energy FERC responsibility setting price caps regions across country. debate whether controversial step seems exposed inherent dissension within FERC time future leadership commission cast doubt. Representatives meeting March 20, H,bert, Republican, reiterated objections price caps. Chairman H,bert maintained opinion wholesale price caps done "long-term damage." January, H,bert me, "I seen evidence price caps positive impact creating balanced Although still generally opposed wholesale price caps federal regional level, willing consider one possibility among short-term resolutions ongoing market California. Reuters reported H,bert said hearings "such controls long-term solution would industry building power plants supply West." Rather, H,bert believes power generators need financial incentive build new power plants, California elsewhere. H,bert quoted subcommittee hearings saying, "Market prices increase supply reduce demand, thus correcting current imbalance. Capping prices regulation legislation exactly opposite effect." Despite H,bert's opposition wholesale price caps, fellow Commissioner William Massey, Democrat, asserted California western region state disrepair temporary "time out" price cap needed let market stabilize. commission must act forcefully decisively reassure market participants, policymakers consumers jurisdictional wholesale markets produce consumer benefits rates," Massey said. addition, Massey reportedly also said "such price cap could calculated generator-by-generator basis generator's variable cost, plus reasonable capacity adder, perhaps range $25 per megawatt hour." Massey reiterated severity crisis California, noting whereas wholesale power state cost $7 billion 1999 increased $27 billion 2000 could exceed $70 billion 2001. Rounding commission's divided opinion Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt, Democrat, said possible options analyzed debated. Breathitt specifically mention preference price controls. Chairman H,bert's stand price caps shared Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham seemingly entire Bush administration. fact, Abraham said price caps wholesale energy "discourage investment new generation time needed" drive power producers regions country (and away California). Energy Secretary reportedly issued even statement price caps Senate electricity crisis California. "The action administration implementation price caps," Abraham said. Another House Representatives Energy Air Quality subcommittee hearing scheduled later week. Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, Texas Republican, noted subcommittee work toward deciding whether legislation regarding wholesale price caps developed next weeks. first time clear schisms become visible within FERC major issues facing energy industry. commission also became divided regarding scope regulation regarding regional transmission (RTOs). FERC's December 1999 vote Alliance RTO illustrated dissension within commission divergent philosophies FERC commissioners hold regarding industry Then-Commissioner H,bert opinion Alliance RTO met FERC guidelines RTO formation, sole member pushed voluntary rather mandatory participation RTO. However, H,bert stood minority. three commissioners FERC time (Hoecker, Massey Breathitt) preferred wield tighter regulatory monitor transmission owners comply current transmission H,bert supports ownership RTOs utilities letting free market principles rule, commissioners FERC appeared support passive ownership RTOs utilities. Meanwhile, speculation continues President Bush soon appoint Pat Wood III, chairman Public Utility Commission Texas (PUCT), position FERC chairman.

Wood, reportedly close ally advisor former Texas governor, repeatedly named strong candidate one Republican openings FERC time. However, Washington Post Reuters reported Wood appointed FERC chairman, forcing H,bert step role commissioner. report Reuters indicated H,bert, friend Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), personally "fighting planned move." nomination would require Senate confirmation. Moreover, political drivers continue impact structure FERC, issue price caps remains unresolved. debate price caps also divided others involved, strictly along party lines. Generally speaking, Democrats believe federal government step prevent called "price gouging" part energy companies.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term higher rate economic growth lead greater expansion natural gas use previously forecast next 20 years --- 34.7 Tcf/ year 2020, 31.5 Tcf 10% increase projected prices --- $2.81/Mcf $3.13, according Energy Information Administration's latest report. EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. economic growth average rate 3% year next 20 years, previous estimate 2.1% per year. economic growth overall U.S. energy demand 96 quadrillion Btu 127 quads 2020, 121 energy quads projected EIA one year ago (see Daily GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). increase projection natural gas demand 2020 slightly 3 Tcf (loosely equal 3 quads) responsible half change energy projections. EIA says 62% increase gas demand 21.4 Tcf 1999 34.7 Tcf 2020, spurred tripling gas use power generation. next 20 years 89% new power generation units fueled natural gas. Gas prices expected decline within two years current highs. "In longer term, technology improvements exploration production oil natural gas expected moderate price increases even demand fuels grows." EIA projects world oil prices reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) 2020, slightly $22.04 last year's forecast. federal bean counters see 1.8% average annual increase power demand next 20 years, compared 1.3% predicted last year. Prices decline current 6.7 cents per kWh, much predicted last year due higher projected gas prices. Instead 5.8 cents per kWh 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding 6.0 cents per kWh. Power provided nuclear generation jumped 34% forecast last year "due lower estimated costs extending life current nuclear plants higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear generation still declines existing plants retire." Coal still primary fuel power generation, share dwindle 51% 44% generating total. full report go site: http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/earlyrelease/index.html *********** I'm sorry taken long get back you. truly chaotic around California situation, lawyers obviously preoccupied, Christian gotten back yet. finally went back Chris Mallory, determined language confirm fine long matches confirm language original deal - 459996. sale Constellation index + $1, we're trying clear positions California Power Exchange, buy back index + $3. make sense, rambling? long day.

Dan, send front end utilize make copies? Send front end last week's filing supporting EPSA's motion. I'll take comments 12 noon Wednesday. gba ============================= Western Power Trading Forum (WPTF) California non-profit trade association almost thirty members sell, buy exchange power throughout Western U.S. pleased provide comments following areas response Order issued last week. 1. Price caps unintended consequences 2. Forward scheduling, penalties, mandatory must-buy, 3. Independent Governing Boards. First, would like take opportunity express overall gratitude Commission issuing Order. members WPTF bitterly frustrated events last summer, equally upset actions non-jurisdictional parties attempt grab steering wheel restructuring, drive ground. listened comments last week, took things said, stated purpose actions. listening you, reading Order, much wanted today, even afforded brief 5-minutes time. would flown California even allowed one phrase uttered publicly. phrase would "Thank you. Thank taking bold step forward revive California's wholesale power market. Thank courage stand parochial interests entirely self serving, absent national policy goals." Commission took stab correcting California's problems utilizing several measures, one $150 price cap. Whereas applaud Commission's effort, find price caps send wrong signal suppliers load. found price caps misallocate resources, Staff report demonstrates, increases exports power parts grid caps exists. find price caps discourage demand-side participation, level proposed, discourage much needed peaking generation resources. also find price cap, especially level proposed, create unintended consequences. example, market bids exceed $150, sellers avoid bidding ISO PX. market solution simple bidding instead competitive exchange PX, APX, AlTrade? liquidity bids suddenly flip one market another arbitrary line single price auction operates, bilateral market prevails? huge hammer, huge movement tens millions dollars moving within space hour one trading vehicle another. WPTF price caps, continues believe price caps much damage, protect consumers. damages include prolonging high prices, reducing price discovery, reducing quantity long-term offers otherwise would afford consumers much-needed price protection. Average prices diminish caps, fact, know, August prices California much higher last June, even though buyer price cap imposed ISO Governing Board $250 instead $750. recognize political reality regulators like price spikes, caps quick solution. feel price caps must imposed, limit damage. believe Commissioner Hebert's price cap proposal starts $250, increments upward specific amounts specific times would least damaging. also believe formulaic price cap moves respect demand, fuel price would harmful. Market participants conduct business much uncertainty hanging balance. Commission recognized matter Governance California needs regulatory stability, Commission pursuing policy options regain much needed stability. hand, floating price work opposite direction. reek havoc inject uncertainty, lessen stability. price caps necessary, stick least damaging supports forward scheduling demand, imposition real-time penalties, support elimination must-buy provision embedded California Preferred Policy Decision. Underscheduling load practice lead economic dislocation, reduced grid reliability. Mandatory pre-scheduling get ISO back track prudently limiting amount load exposed real-time resolution. Also, eliminating must-buy provision, UDCs longer complain "supply avenues finding cost-effective supply unlimited. Finally, support replacement stakeholder boards independent board members. Whereas troubled ISO Governing Board, must note PX Governing Board type problems. PX Governing Board done much better finding solutions thorny problems. asking spare one eliminate other. actions ISO Governing proven highly damaging credibility electric restructuring. states eschew restructuring observing endless debates, layers upon layers State interference workings California ISO Governing Board, leverage exercised voting blocks Governors interests totally removed well-being institution whose Board serve. concerned rules laid replacing stakeholder Governing Board may enough. may incredible pressure placed upon existing Board members select candidates aims claim protect consumers, fact, making power grab. organization promises Commission suspect, evidence, detect, otherwise observe actions undermine independence new Board, assure back raising voice loudly protest. California market simply survive serving two masters. jurisdictional tug war must end quickly move forward pursue goals ambitions set Commission Orders 888, 2000.

Analysis: United States awakes energy policy slumber, becoming increasingly apparent days near complete reliance natural-gas-fired generation meet growing energy needs coming end. According EIA statistics, natural gas prices risen historic highs January 2001 utility deliveries exceeding $10/MMBtu, compared 1998 1999 prices floated $2 $3/MMBtu. Virtually overnight, natural gas gone one least expensive generation fuels one expensive. Since January price spike, prices settled back $4 $5.5 /MMBtu level Henry Hub futures prices, even prices would considered high twelve months ago. Coal, comparison, United States abundant fuel source, constituting 95 percent nation's fossil energy reserves. Coal prices actually dropped utility deliveries past several years according EIA statistics. 1994, coal prices averaged $28.03/short-ton ($1.37/MMbtu) compared $24.68/short-ton ($1.21/MMbtu) second quarter 2000. Although coal generation currently represents 51 percent U.S. generation production, plants recently built environmental concerns associated coal generation relatively low price natural gas throughout 1990s. 1999, U.S. coal production actually declined 2.1 percent primarily attributable large drop coal exports coupled smaller usual growth coal consumption power generation. brighter days may lie ahead coal industry. New, so-called "clean-coal" technologies tested developed. 1970s 80s pressurized fluidized bed coal combustor (PFBC) developed, removing sulfur (SO2) pollutants limiting formation nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutants inside boiler. need scrubbers post-combustion controls eliminated technology. Texas New Mexico Power (TNP) constructed two 150 MW lignite-fired units went operational 1990 1991 based circulating fluidized bed (CFB) technology Reliant proposing 520 MW facility Pennsylvania. TNP One power plant was, however, extremely costly build. Unit 1 cost $357 million ($2,380/kW) Unit 2 cost $282.9 million ($1,886/kW) construct. Another technology developed integrated gasification-combined cycle (IGCC) technology first converts coal combustible gas, cleans gas virtually pollutants, burns gas turbine much like natural gas. 99 percent sulfur, nitrogen, particulate pollutants removed process. Three gasification power plants built Florida, Indiana, Nevada. early 1990s, PSI Energy Destec teamed construct 262 MW IGCC generating unit Wabash River Project Indiana total installation cost $592 million ($2,260/kW). 1996, TECO completed construction 250 MW IGCC generating unit Polk Power station Florida total installation cost $508 million ($2,032/kW). Japan also experimented clean-coal technologies. 1998, Hokkaido Electric Power Co. Inc. started commercial operation 75 MW PFBC power plant. Test operations carried two plants, 250 MW unit Chugoku Electric Power Co. 350 MW unit Kyushu Electric Power Co. Japan also testing pilot scale (1 MW) molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) Chubu Electric Power Co. site. interesting note advanced technologies historically approached installation cost nuclear plant, operational costs coal plant. market conditions changed, despite high capital operating costs, clean-coal technologies economically compete natural-gas-fired generation, gas prices continue remain high. Additionally, expectations next generation clean-coal power plants cost significantly less early pioneers' cost. Department Energy (DOE) example, assumes IGGC power plant built $1,315/kW average heat rate 8,470 Btu/kWh "Annual Energy Outlook 2000" report. DOE deserves great deal credit bringing clean-coal technology point commercialization. 1984, clean-coal experiment began response U.S./Canadian transboundary problem acid March 1987, President Reagan agreed new $5 billion public-private initiative make clean-coal technologies reality. program led 40 projects 18 states, including co-funding demonstration projects TECO facilities. mid-1980s options reducing NOx pollution cost $3,000 per ton; today's low NOx reduced cost $200/ton. low NOx burners also reduced emission levels 700 parts per million (ppm) early 1970s 100 ppm today. Furthermore, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) process reduces 80% NOx contained coal combustion gas. DOE reports 75 percent coal-fired capacity country outfitted low-NOx burners. Similarly, cost scrubbing technology, removes sulfur pollutants, reduced 75 percent since 1970s. improvement power generation efficiency one important technical issues coal power plants high carbon content. latest commercial plant achieved thermal efficiency 43 percent increasing steam temperature pressure. Even improved efficiencies, coal power plant future may still unable achieve substantial greenhouse gas reductions could necessary address global climate change concerns. existing environmental regulations may also limit adoption new coal generation. SIP Call rule requires 22 Eastern states District Columbia reduce NOx emission specified amount May 2003, much reductions expected come coal-fired power plants. 1997, National Ambient Air Quality Standards particulate matter ozone adopted anticipated compliance cost full attainment estimated $37 billion per year (particulate) $10 billion per year (ozone) respectively. Supreme Court reviewing EPA rules, recently supported EPA's right regulate emissions [see 3/1/01 IssueAlert www.ConsultRCI.com]. rules significant since lead additional NOx SO2 emission reductions, two precursors fine airborne particles. Mercury reductions also contemplated. November 1999 EPA filed lawsuits seven utility companies Clean Air Act violations. settlement TECO, TECO agreed cut NOx SO2 emissions 85 percent 2010 pay $3.5 million civil penalty. end, nation likely turn coal help meet growing energy demands. Great strides made reduce environmental impact abundant fuel source. Since 1970, use coal doubled emissions sulfur nitrogen pollutants declined 70 percent 40 percent, respectively. continue achieve even greater emission reductions, coal may well help provide energy bridge future. archive list previous IssueAlerts available www.ConsultRCI.com Reach thousands utility analysts decision makers every day. company schedule sponsorship IssueAlert contacting Nancy Spring via e-mail calling (505)244-7613.

Modern Metals, July 2001 Giant energy concern turns attention steel. company's aggressive posture begged controversy. Industry reactions vary hand-wringing open arms. Still characterize Enron "non-event." Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor days, saying word "Enron" room full metals like screaming "fire" crowded theater. steel industry, idea futures market enough raise eyebrows. market maker annual revenues 10 times market cap U.S. industry stakes claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues $101 billion--that's "b"), lot eyebrows likely raised. bold Jeff McMahon, president CEO Enron Industrial Markets, SSCI convention May (in accused steel mills treating service center customers "annoyances"), industry leaders rushed understand latest market contender. Friend foe? Competitor partner? couple questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push metals Judging service center mill executives Modern Metals queried, many answers opinions industry. Reactions ranged fear acceptance downright resentment. least one mill reticent discuss Enron all--still others seemed meet issue unaffected shrugs. saying true publicity good publicity, buzz Enron generated would make even Hollywood spin doctor envious. hubbub? Although products natural gas energy--Enron's major business platform--have traded commodities years, Enron's appearance formal forward market steel never existed. According McMahon, absence liquid transparent market resulted "uninformed investment exacerbated current oversupply situation, left companies exposed hazards price volatility. Enron's answer offer variety hedging products along forward contracts hot-rolled, cold-rolled galvanized (plate long products soon follow), locking prices many five years out. Enron act intermediary" steel transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins lowering capital. Certain grades steel commodities, McMahon insists, sold commodity market basis, instead strategic relationships exist mills consumers. Enron offering steel online, via phone fax, since November last "Before add capacity, make investment decision, able see three, five, maybe even 10-year forward price steel," McMahon stated, "and want hedge investment that." company plans buy steel floating price sell steel consumers fixed rate, making money spread. February, Greg Hermans, VP steel trading Enron, reported AMM offering U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled April delivery Chicago $225 ton. Hermans said Enron buying product April delivery $215 ton. Eventually, Enron sees development four different marketplaces: Northeast, Midwest (or Chicago area), Coast (or Houston area), West Coast. Enron hedge spot price spikes equity physical holdings domestic mills. company closed Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill June. "It's big portfolio," McMahon said. "We wanted put together portfolio supply demand. cases, we'll assets--hopefully we'll term contracts domestic mills. extent imports part equation, we'll part market. may purchase capacity somebody, necessarily assets, toll slab hot strip mill. combined business." Steel mills benefit, McMahon said, entering multi-year "physical take" Enron, thus giving steel mills degree certain volume product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase specified amount tonnage, use floating price floor price guard market shocks. Whether mills would willing divert capacity commodity grades bought sold Enron remains uncertain. least one mill executive privately said . . . least now. Nucor president, CEO vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value Enron's proposal. "What need stable pricing levels efficient mills make good return capital invest new technologies equipment," stated. "I true value helping industry become stronger. good maintain lack price volatility $200 ton." Keith Busse, CEO Steel Dynamics, echoed sentiment recent New Steel article. "If trying get volatility $320 [per ton], great," said. "But $230, want stick fingers service centers Service centers, McMahon suggested, could immediately. "The way [distributors] able hedge go buy inventory," explained. "That takes capital, cash, space. offer financial product gives exact protection, require above. "We hold inventories price steel time delivery service centers," continued, "so 4- 5- percent net margins somewhat certain." "I think Enron providing service industry . . . commented Dave Lerman, CEO Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. pointed "how [it] moves forward interesting. move forward hedge instruments . . that's independent whether run business well good supplier matches demands customers. think [Enron] good thing people non-event others." Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm enforceable contracts could become key benefit service centers. one Midwestern distributor source commented, "One terrible things happens business end users demand long-term pricing, beyond anybody foresee. anticipate market going up, hit low point, push harder it--as one would. historically, honor deals." market, explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance result orders, releases, "don't call us, we'll call you" attitude customers. consequence service centers, said, price reductions way way up. "If Enron brings integrity sides market," concluded, "that would big plus steel industry." integrity, Midwest service center exec countered, got nothing it. estimation, Enron like profiteering carpetbagger, "trying make buck producer user. That's need right now," declared, "somebody trying squeeze dollars." But, recognized, "we're going deal it." McNeeley, president CEO Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated good could come heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas industry, acknowledged people might offended somebody picking so-called "low-hanging fruit" steel market current economy. "What think mills going come peripheral items?" queried. "My concern would would go [those items]." McNeeley also questioned distributors relinquishing control inventories. "In distribution, 60 percent net worth inventory, 30 percent accounts receivable, 10 percent plant property equipment," related. "Our single largest asset inventory. company surrenders control inventory third party, distributor, effect, surrender sovereignty?" begun Questions abound regarding Enron's role physical supplier steel well. one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, "are ready deal problems?" Although Enron expressed interest physical supplier, Dave Lerman explained, "I that's going lot difficult implement." Enron would consider specific qualities, coil sizes, nuances chemistry, surface quality, formability. "Most customers require better standard tolerances," pointed out. issues might complicate commodity sales." Delivery another issue. physical Enron virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery, one service center source said, "the guarantee good material shows door. happens show up? disappoint customer. good sue [Enron] I've lost customer?" Mill executives questioned whether Enron potential competitor. "They see Enron someone likely buy foreign steel order deliver U.S. customer," said Chuck Bradford, principal Bradford Research long-time industry observer. cautioned seeing Enron much physical supplier, speculating future Enron, similar LME, hedging. "You may see [physical transactions] start with," Bradford predicted, "just get ball rolling. see way market develop." McMahon consistent saying Enron little interest becoming steel manufacturer. real value, said, transparent, liquid market. "We know products work, know market wants them. one particular mill mills that? think so," said. "It's 'if', 'when'." jury still soon "when" come, effects steel industry. debate surrounding issue, seems bit soon hitting panic button. McNeeley recounted, "I recall similar controversy speech guy gave 15-17 years ago. guy's name Ken Iverson, concept called mini-mill.

I'll take shot answering questions, Steve. Others free comment well. transmission issues ISO greatly lessened. talk traders, LOVE it. April1, 1998, sales CA. Now, millions dollars sales. Why? -- transmission access speak ISO took over. still problems, however. problems since day one FERC punted them. huge FERC case dealing many them. also appealed stupid FERC order Path 15 probably least year ago heard nothing FERC it. traders also seriously considered FERC complaint Path 15. So, access issues? Path 15 major constraint point northern southern CA. years. transmission fix basically adding third intertie line Tracy Tesla. left PG&E 1996, estimated coast $300 million. congestion costs justify building line then. PG&E continues control Path 15 tells ISO what's left PG&E allocates capacity decides rating changes. transparency. PG&E ability use Path 15 advantage Diablo Canyon given existing contracts. Carl looked somewhat think PG&E is, but;... ISO says can't interpret contracts munis filed funky thing FERC kind overseer -- protested appealed. munis receiving preferential access since Day One -- contracts generally subservient IOU rights -- like interruptible -- ISO started, sudden, muni rights became super firm superceding IOU rights (as far tell sketchy filings discussions ISO staff). That's pushed issue. Also, Dynegy Power Exchange (not PX) rights Path 15. Tim Belden would love get info constaint operated. Information general pretty sketchy real-time transmission. complained ISO ISO knows what's going transmission (as utilities), changes does, changes prices, tell us fact. ISO promised better, think implemented real changes yet. Advantageous access. Except what's going Path 15, think IOUs advantages access -- except respect Regulatory Must Run resources like nuclear hydro -- think resource specific, rather owner specific. munis another story. See next item. Munis Preference huge issue assume across country. making devil's bargain munis, FERC put ISO untenable situation. "sanctity contracts" conditions created preference incumbents (not IOUs -- everyone transmission contract IOUs) poor rights poor schlepps like us come new market. ISO cannot operate system way forced give munis/Dynegy originally let things one else (e.g., munis get change schedule actrive hour begins, get every half hour, far pay ancillary services, etc.) many, many examples discriminated (in addition Path 15) FERC shined us -- yet fight on. recent muni giveaway litigation surrounding "new" transmission charge CA -- entangled rules munis joining ISO. munis want huge handouts join. part "new" rate includes hundreds millions subsidies munis -- I've pointed amounts IOU's customers paying munis' stranded transmission costs, already paying IOUs' stranded generation costs, argument fell deaf ears ISO. really issue, make kind sick public policy stands state.

CFTC Rules Could Change Futures Industry; Question Bridge News - November 29, 2000 Mary Haffenberg months anticipation, new regulatory rules released last week pave way changes exchanges list derivatives contracts. proposals also open door new electronic trading platforms clearing organizations jump derivatives listing clearing business. rules interpreted without making law leaving industry players wary. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, regulator U.S. derivatives markets, last week approved rules first proposed February create new regulatory framework futures markets. rules, go effect 60 days first appear Federal Register, create three regulatory tiers various futures contracts swaps products established markets fall. idea three tiers match degree regulation varying nature products customers trading markets. new rules, three regulatory tiers recognized futures exchanges, derivatives transactions facilities exempt multilateral transaction execution facilities. Products within RFE category, example, allow retail participation contracts customer protection regulatory safeguards attached them. bill passed House Representatives October stalled Senate would make law CFTC rule changes. bill also would legalize single stock futures, provide legal certainty over-the-counter markets, take CFTC rule changes even farther areas make changes within power CFTC. bill, Commodity Futures Modernization Act 2000, overcome significant obstacles Senate pass Congress returns next month finish work, bill would supercede CFTC rules. CFTC rules go effect least end January beginning February (as Wednesday, still listed Federal Register), lawyers others reading rules hurry digest interpret them. addition, lot could change lawmakers pass futures modernization act. WIDESPREAD PRAISE RULE CHANGES sure, rule changes spurred CFTC Chairman William Rainer received widespread praise. Market participants established exchanges like idea less regulated markets costs business expected decrease. Also, less regulation could lead flexibility listing trading contracts experimentation futures markets, recent years sorely lagging compared growth cash securities markets. also double-edged sword changes. rules make significantly easier new electronic trading platform, similar electronic communications networks popular equities markets, come list futures contracts, taking established futures exchanges decades virtual contract-listing monopoly. rules also allow, first time, non-CFTC regulated organizations clear exempt MTEF bilateral contracts. However, clearing groups still must regulated banking laws, foreign regulators Securities Exchange Commission. Established clearing organizations futures exchanges already expressing concern new expected competitors able become nimble able operate less regulation. established exchanges clearing organizations expected fall regulated CFTC tier regulations continue serve retail customers. "If we're provider broad series markets, unclear net savings," said Dennis Dutterer, interim president CEO Chicago Board Trade. estimates, 90% futures market participants institutional commercial customers. figure mind, ECNs could come list contracts DTF category. would prohibit retail customer participation unless ECN got special CFTC approval would allow retail trading futures commission merchants least $20 million adjusted net capital. exchanges, date least retail participation contracts, would continue RFE rules. industry watchers suggested exchanges, combat ECN competition yet retain retail customers, could list two contracts. example, New York Board Trade could RFE sugar pit all-electronic DTF sugar pit. NYBOT President CEO Mark Fichtel said exchange expected request sugar cocoa contracts fall DTF category. "I'm saying happen, based they're talking about, careful compartmentalizing markets," said Joseph Murphy, CEO Refco Global Futures, one country's largest FCMs. "A probable solution would put backs FCMs. could become 'market makers' give access retail customers, like FX markets," referring cash foreign exchange markets interbank markets commonly take side customer trade instead routing outside customers. Others question whether course futures markets result rule changes whether good markets "peripheral markets" proliferating. However, still early determine traditional exchanges list contracts new rules. Although one suggesting exchanges close doors easy access retail customers, allowing markets may cheap. "I would hope CFTC would continue concept trying ensure markets competitive competing markets exchanges looking flexibility respond competitive possibilities," Dutterer said. SWAP MARKETS CONTINUE EXEMPTIONS part, participants swaps basically happy CFTC done within limited powers exempt MTEF rules. example, new entities, insurance companies, participate swaps markets. markets continue operate exemption commodities act continue without legal certainty, spokeswoman International Swaps Derivatives Association said rule changes improvement current conditions. However, ISDA unhappy financial products included exempt MTEF category. CFTC said metals energy contracts cannot qualify exempt MTEF, least regulated tier, markets sufficiently deep liquid concerns related exhaustibility supply market manipulation. result, multilateral electronic executing trading facilities fall DTF category, led concerns regulations may stymie innovation markets. rules come play, assuming Congress codify them, still another underlying concern. CFTC rules law, industry worry interpreted upcoming years different CFTC heads. all, regulator share leaders vastly different philosophies other.

True, California would heading summer power shortages even never deregulated. even workable competition wholesale electricity market, prices market would spike periods peak demand, transferring billions dollars either taxpayers consumers generators. evidence overwhelming workable competition California's power market, actions generators "gaming system" greatly magnified crisis. key fact California somehow remained state less continuous power shortage high wholesale prices regardless level demand. rash outages kept electricity market conveniently - profitably - short supply even periods low demand, ought lots excess capacity. Frank Wolak, Stanford economist also advises state's power grid, pointed out, outage power plant lot like employee calling sick. can't tell directly whether really sick chosen take day reasons, look circumstantial evidence. evidence convinced Mr. Wolak "generators use forced outages strategically withhold capacity market" - view shared growing number researchers. brings us latest move Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Wednesday, commission apparently decided offer California relief, put new price caps place California electricity market. say "apparently" look plan less likely seems help all. Indeed, measure passed 2-to-1 vote, William Massey - one commissioner sympathetic calls price controls - voting grounds would ineffectual. What's wrong FERC's plan? First, caps prices emergency conditions - ignoring fact electricity prices stayed hard- to-explain levels even emergency. effect, plan laid electricity market really competitive, spite evidence not. Second, even emergency price caps full loopholes, offering extensive opportunities Mr. Wolak calls "megawatt laundering" - selling power affiliated companies one reason another exempted price controls (for example, controls apply "imports" neighboring states), selling back California market. Severin Borenstein University California Energy Institute adds allowed price depends cost generation least efficient plant, generators clear incentive produce inefficiently: "I predict find plants never heard suddenly operating again, pretty inefficient." general verdict seems serious plan. serious proposals mitigate crisis - indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted proposal well received experts - FERC ignored them. charitable interpretation FERC still get it, can't bring believe time wolf real. uncharitable interpretation last week's action meant fail. Medley Report, online newsletter, calls FERC plan "a grand exercise posturing without substance . . . clever temporary move Bush administration deflect political fallout" looming disaster.

California Wholesale Electricity Markets 21. 1996 California deregulated electricity industry required State's privately owned utility companies divest plants. purpose deregulation introduce competition electricity markets, intention reducing rates electrical power. fact, however, certain participants recently deregulated industry have, violation operating Tariff, taken advantage structural flaws system improperly obtained confidential competitor information artificially inflate prices electricity, yielding billions dollars windfall profits expense California consumers. 22. part deregulation, several new entities created facilitate workings new market. California's investor owned utilities, Pacific & Electric (PG&E), Southern California Edison (SCE), San Diego Gas & Electric (the"Utilities"), purchase electricity customers independent generators traders, including defendants, market known California Power Exchange (PX). PX maintains market purchase wholesale electricity variety forward contracts real time markets. California deregulatory scheme, Utilities were, recently, required purchase power PX prohibited independently power outside market. 23. deregulated also led creation California Independent System Operator (CAISO). CAISO "independent" non-profit corporation, managing board includes representatives among generators created manage flow electricity ensure reliability along long distance, high-voltage power lines make bulk California's transmission system. Approximately 75% California's electricity distributed CAISO managed "power grid". CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e., demand) on-going basis ensures adequate supply power meet demand. / / / 24. CAISO accomplishes maintaining Real Time Imbalance Market (the "Real Time Market"). CAISO receives bids suppliers insufficient meet demand power, must accept bid, sets market-clearing price hour. single price auction system used CAISO, sellers electricity Real Time Market automatically receive market clearing price, (second) highest price paid market, even willing sell fact bid sell electricity lower prices. mechanism allows sophisticated market participants, defendants, game market withholding bids effort maximize clearing price. 25. Real Time Market designed handle large transactions, merely provide mechanism correct imbalances supply demand. Defendants nonetheless pushed substantial portion daily wholesale electricity sales market bidding capacity forward market leaving wholesale customers alternative place obtain power satisfy retail customers' demand. 26. CAISO also manages Replacement Reserve Market, used balance supply demand electricity. Sellers Replacement Reserve Market receive fixed premium available capacity. called upon ISO deliver energy, sellers Replacement Reserve Market also receive Real Time Market price. Thus, generators know capacity short, incentive withhold supplies spot markets push much possible Replacement Reserve Market. Access real time information facilitates "gaming" markets demonstrating, real time, available competing supply. 27. times high demand, CAISO authority purchase energy out-of-state sources, operative price cap. CAISO forced Summer 2000. California generators marketers export electricity surrounding markets order create artificial shortages drive prices California markets. resell electricity CAISO inflated uncapped prices. PX Compliance Committee noted November 1, 2000 Report ("the PX Compliance Report"): / / / "During periods high Out-of-Market purchases, prices Real-Time energy price cap, in-state generators incentive export energy California. Surrounding control areas effectively park energy resale CAISO Out-of-Market calls return state." Id. p. 44. 28. Notably, summer witnessed approximately 370% increase exports California energy market, despite high prices short supplies existed State. "Market power" defined CAISO ability significantly influence market prices cause vary competitive levels material period time. Generators suppliers (including defendants) exercise market power physically economically withholding electricity market, moving electricity California markets, pricing bidding resources ways impede efficiency market. 29. Notably, California energy market consists relatively small number firms, control substantial fraction total generating capacity. small number suppliers facilitates exercise market power periods high demand, even true scarcity available generating capacity. addition, relatively inelastic demand energy facilitates exercise market power. B. Defendants' Improper Acts 30. Prior May 22, 2000, CAISO began supplying Western Systems Coordinating Council ("WSCC"), organization consisting electric industry participants, including defendants, real time industry data electricity generating levels, known metering data, transmission system flow data, known scheduling data, pertaining individual participants. WSCC Internet web site, wholesale market participants, including defendants herein, thereby given access real time data competitors' actions, although access data forbidden ISO Tariff. requested various governmental entities, including California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC") WSCC refused access. / / / / / / / / / 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states relevant part; Meter Data supplied ISO metered entity shall made available ISO scheduling coordinator representing ISO metered entity authorized users identified meter services agreement, shall disclosed third party except otherwise may required law, FERC local regulatory authority provision ISO Tariff. 32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states relevant part: ISO shall maintain confidentiality documents, data information provided Market Participant treated confidential commercially sensitive Section 20.3.2; provided, however, ISO need keep confidential: (1) information explicitly subject data exchange WEnet pursuant Section 6 ISO Tariff; (2) information ISO Market Participant providing information required disclose pursuant Tariff, applicable regulatory requirements (provided ISO shall comply applicable limits disclosure); (3) information becomes available public non-confidential basis (other result ISO's breach ISO Tariff). 33. CAISO/FERC Tariff section states relevant part: following information provided ISO Scheduling Coordinators shall treated ISO confidential: (a) individual bids Supplemental Energy; (b) individual Adjustment Bids Congestion Management designated scheduling coordinator available; (c) individual bids Ancillary Services; (d) transactions Scheduling Coordinators; (e) individual Generator Outage programs unless Generator makes change Generator Outage program causes Congestion short term (i.e. one month less), case, ISO may publish name Generator. 34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states relevant part: Market Participant shall right hereunder receive ISO review documents, data information another Market Participant extent documents, data information treated accordance Section 20.3.2; provided, however, market Participant may receive review composite documents, data, information may developed based upon confidential documents, data, information, composite document disclose confidential information relating individual Market Participant provided, however, ISO may disclose information provided bylaws. Part CAISO Tariff ISO Market Monitoring & Information Protocol (MMIP). objective Protocol (MMIP) set forth workplan rules ISO monitor ISO markets identify abuses market power. MMIP part tariff applies ISO Market Participants, including Defendants. 36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states relevant part: Anomalous market behavior, defined behavior departs significantly normal behavior competitive markets require continuing regulation behavior leading unusual unexplained market outcomes. Evidence behavior may derived number circumstances, including: MMIP 2.1.1.1 withholding generation capacity circumstances would normally offered competitive market; MMIP 2.1.1.2 unexplained unusual redeclarations availability Generators; MMIP 2.1.1.3 unusual trades transactions; MMIP 2.1.1.4 pricing bidding patterns inconsistent prevailing supply demand conditions, e.g., prices bids appear consistently excessive otherwise inconsistent conditions; MMIP 2.1.1.5 unusual activity circumstances relating imports exports markets exchanges. Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, ongoing basis, whether continued persistent presence circumstances indicates presence behavior designed potential distort operation efficient functioning competitive market, e.g., strategic withholding redeclaring capacity, whether indicates presence exercise market power unacceptable practices. 37.

"Gaming" may also include taking undue advantage conditions may affect availability transmission generation capacity, loop flow, facility outages, level hydropower output seasonal limits energy imports out-of-state, actions behaviors may otherwise render system ISO markets vulnerable price manipulation detriment efficiency. 38. Market participants used trade organization, share access use real time information, notwithstanding fact publication use violated ISO's operating procedures, set forth tariffs protocols filed approved FERC, adoption made part contracts defendants authorized sell electricity PX. tariffs protocols required data kept confidential prevent gaming market used market participants engage anti-competitive behavior. 39. reported Dow Jones Work.

Charlie sees problem putting ENA's name, someone sees issue this, please let know ASAP. George, Melissa, Lia - need start nom'ing PVR/PTR. Chris Germany - need PTR contract TGT? Teresa - per Production & Delivery Agrmt, states St. Mary's cannot process gas. need waiver section 4, time period processing mandatory. Lia, George, John - OFO notice came January 26, heard via Charlie today, way future notified quickly possible issues flow VPP gas?

They've writing letters, lobbying lawmakers launching informal talks Pacific Gas Electric Co. get hook summer. dodges blackout bullet "is going play political hot button" around state, said George Fraser, head Northern California Power Agency, coalition municipal utilities. Sacramento, next volley expected soon, Sacramento Municipal Utility District reportedly poised notify PG&E longer black homes businesses larger utility's command. "We absolutely trying fight requirement rolling blackouts Sacramento area," said Linda Davis, one seven elected members SMUD board directors. Saying want dragged somebody else's problems, two Southern California utilities written grid operators asking exempted blackouts caused PG&E's Southern California Edison's financial woes. PG&E's view, "California energy crisis (and) ... we're together," said spokesman John Nelson. maneuvering comes amid bleak forecasts power supplies summer. Although Gov. Gray Davis said conservation, new power plants moderate weather could avert blackouts, officials Independent System Operator, runs much California's grid, expect frequent rotating outages. One consulting firm, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, predicts 20 hours rolling blackouts July August, 200 hours especially intense calls voluntary cutbacks. blackouts hit, jockeying whose lights, air conditioners assembly lines shut growing. outcome could affect millions people statewide. state Public Utilities Commission probing rolling blackout programs run for-profit utilities regulates, including PG&E Edison. PUC analysis suggested PG&E's program, currently exempts 40 percent customers, spread burden broadly. example, said, 1.9 million homes businesses spared share circuit customer deemed not-for-profit utilities SMUD, answer elected boards city councils, worries. Many already lined power supplies summer. raised rates considering raising rates. taken extra conservation steps. think preparations ought give leverage ease blackout clauses contracts PG&E. SMUD general manager Jan Schori "is going use every avenue ... avenue, put pressure on," including lobbying ISO, others, said utility director Davis. Northern California Power Agency, joint-powers authority owns operates power plants municipal utilities, begun informal negotiations PG&E change blackout rules, according Fraser, top executive. preparing write PG&E, asking members exempted outages altogether. Failing that, wants face fewer outages compensated cutting power, said. SMUD, utility board met closed session discuss exactly required electric emergencies, terms interconnection contract links SMUD's lines PG&E's. "The contracts inspected fine-tooth comb," said SMUD director Howard Posner. Schori declined comment specifics. Sources indicated main option considered notifying PG&E changed circumstances, SMUD believes longer required routinely comply outage requests. options explored include re-negotiating existing agreements PG&E. Posner said ever since two days rolling blackouts January, constituents asking him, " 'Why participating we're problem?' good answer that." Several directors said SMUD spent lot money -- considering 16 percent rate increases -- ensure enough electricity contract meet summer demands. believe PG&E same. "We're almost like David Goliath here," said board vice Genevieve Shiroma. "The huge investor-owned utilities next door severe problems need get control." addition, SMUD plans argue cut usage "Peak Corps" program, remotely turns air conditioners volunteer households, already done part without rotating outages, director Davis said. PG&E believes interconnection agreements govern smaller utilities' ties transmission lines "benefits burdens sides," said Nelson. "It fair good policy one provision altered without taking look affects entire contract," said. Interconnection contracts clauses require utilities help avert greater emergencies. Sometimes reducing demand -- called load shedding -- way stabilize electric grid seconds major power plant transmission line fails. "It's around electrical fabric forever," said Jim Pope, head Silicon Valley Power, Santa Clara's city-run utility. addition legal requirements, "you moral obligation bring system collapse." Like city-run Silicon Valley Power contract PG&E requires shed load electric emergency. contract allows work big users reduce demand, one completely shut off. agreements, formed long deregulation PG&E ran north state's grid, complicated 1997 creation state Independent System Operator. ISO today runs pieces grid owned PG&E, Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric Co. believes power use surge past supply, potentially triggering grid collapse across western United States, ISO notifies three utilities shed certain number megawatts. big utilities meet requirement two ways. cut circuits customers, tell smaller, connected utilities cut proportionate share. Northern California, 80 percent outages borne PG&E customers rest customers SMUD municipal utilities irrigation districts. "In one sense, together. SMUD danger going down, would hope others would help us out," said SMUD's Posner. "But that's we're danger circumstances beyond control, mismanagement lack financial wherewithal." unclear penalties, any, utility would face violating interconnection agreement. long run, issue would fought either courts Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, grid officials said. practical matter, seconds risk grid greatest, one utility refused shed load, ISO would probably solve problem calling PG&E, Edison others willing make deeper cutbacks, said. *********** GCP adjustments highlighted red.

Here's attachment easy distribution: Here's full article quick scanning: Monday April 9 4:23 PM ET Power Situation State Associated Press, state-by-state look electric power situation summer: Alabama: Blackouts rolling brownouts unlikely utilities required maintain reserve 15 percent needed meet peak demand. Residential business customers pay rates 1.1 percent year ago. Alaska: Blackouts brownouts unlikely. Hydroelectric power plentiful, generating systems taxed. Electric bills expected fall slightly. Arizona: little likelihood power interruption. Utilities prepared handle summer electricity demand, price caps prevent major utilities increasing rates. Arkansas: Blackouts rolling brownouts highly unlikely. Electric bills expected rise 5 percent increased fuel costs passed customers summer expected even hotter year ago, readings topped 111 degrees Little Rock. California: Forecasts tight power supplies throughout West energy experts California warning statewide rolling blackouts summer. Power grid managers say concerted conservation efforts, accelerated construction new power plants ``a bit luck'' could help avoid blackouts. Grid managers already ordered rotating blackouts four days since January. Los Angeles likely spared L.A. Department Water Power provides generation connected state's grid. Colorado: state unlikely experience blackouts brownouts 93 percent power comes coal-fired plants. fixed, long-term contracts coal, producers anticipate fuel cost adjustments. Connecticut: brownouts blackouts anticipated. Brownouts possible, though, prolonged spike usage power plants down. Utilities mandatory price rate cap. Delaware: Enough power available avoid blackouts brownouts, questions linger whether utilities deliver it. Power undergoing deregulation Delaware officials concerned possibility increased costs. However, 1998 deregulation law, cost electricity temporarily capped. Florida: Power outages unlikely summer state reserves 20 percent. Utility companies already increased rates cover higher fuel costs. Unless coal oil wholesale prices increase sharply, consumers expect major rate increases. Georgia: Blackouts brownouts unlikely state for-profit regulatory system gives suppliers incentive build generating plants. Rising costs natural gas, fuels almost new electric plants, could increase residential electric bills 25 percent. Hawaii: little likelihood blackouts, rolling brownouts price spikes. island state, Hawaii's electricity system connected states. island generation system supply sufficient meet demand. Idaho: little chance blackouts rolling brownouts bills rising. state's largest utility wants 34 percent increase residential rates.

Iowa: state expect blackouts summer, problems could occur early 2002 serious capacity problems 2006. single-digit price increases expected summer. Kansas: Blackouts rolling brownouts unlikely. Kansas never regional blackout. size electric bills hot gets much power customers use air conditioning. State law prohibits price spikes regulated utilities, supply 70 percent residential customers. Kentucky: Electricity rates state among lowest nation, likely rise 3.2 percent 3.8 percent 2003, largely due pollution control equipment upgrades. adequate supply avoid brownouts blackouts summer. Louisiana: blackouts expected summer utility officials say state verge power crisis unless plants built. Consumer say bills likely increase much 30 percent high natural gas prices hot summer forecast. Maine: Five new natural gas-fired power plants line coming line soon, reducing prospect rolling blackouts. consumer rate increases expected. Maryland: Public Service Commission expect service interruptions believes electricity rates rise. electric deregulation plan implemented last year reduced, froze, rates homes businesses.

Michigan: state law signed last year deregulate electricity industry 2002, utilities cut rates 5 percent must cap rates five years. Although demand electricity 2 percent 3 percent utilities say enough supply meet demand. Minnesota: blackouts rolling brownouts likely unless extended heat wave power plant failure. Electricity costs expected remain steady. Many customers, however, spend summer months paying natural gas electricity bills long, cold winter. Mississippi: Blackouts summer unlikely. two main power suppliers taking measures reserves peak summer months new independent generating plants also available. Mississippi Power expects bills customers 3 percent 6 percent summer. Entergy, another filed summer rate plan yet.

Scott Calif Price Cap Driving In-State Power Oregon, Wash Mark Jason Leopold 12/06/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California's wholesale electricity price cap far free-market prices Northwest large amounts state's electricity exported Wednesday Northwest, raising risk blackouts California. Tuesday, electricity Northwest delivery Wednesday traded $370-$390 megawatt-hour, well California Independent System Operator's price cap $250/MWh. California utilities, buy power California Power Exchange's day-ahead market, refuse pay ISO's $250/MWh limit. bother offer power $250 CalPX market. Seeing opportunity arbitrage profits, Northwest utilities electricity trading companies appeared CalPX's market Tuesday buyers, even though California utilities usually buyers there, CalPX market source said. bought power exchange $400/MWh California-Oregon border hub - $250/MWh power $150 per megawatt import power - leaving state less electricity Wednesday leaving California's independent power producers wondering gets difference $250/MWh maximum price get CalPX $400/MWh CalPX charges buyers Northwest. Transmission lines carry power California congested Tuesday imports exports power. Due congestion, charge use lines $150/MWh, CalPX market sources said. California looks priced market next couple months. Forward contracts electricity Washington state peaked Tuesday $750/MWh deliveries January, falling $650/MWh. balance December Washington state, power traded $1,200/MWh. course, California could get back market abandoning price cap, breaking week due skyrocketing wholesale prices natural gas. Quietly, ISO purchasing power prices cap outside computer-based market deals struck orally out-of-state utilities. resolution setting price cap allows out-of-market purchases needed supply emergency - out-of-state sources.

Budget Binge Could Scare Legislators Deal According sources, Assembly "terrified" current holes budget due buying power. impact energy crisis reportedly causing panic among legislators. panic appears moving SoCal bailout plan forward. Sources report modified B deal "not far off"; likely take one two weeks (more likely closer two) move deal Assembly Senate governor's desk introduced. 2. Would New Plan B Look Like? modified Plan B deal, originate Assembly, almost certainly include dedicated rate component SoCal's Revenue bonds issued securitized dedicated rate component. also likely generators would offered 70 cents dollar owed immediately, possibility win litigation. (Sources report state "fairly confident" least generators would successful winning additional money.) Assembly Speaker Keeley reportedly remains driving force behind plan, drawn within office. 3. Transmission Lines - remains unclear time whether transmission line purchase option purchase put deal, since major point contention Democrats Republicans. According sources, Assembly "working this." 4. Plan Looks Good Pass Assembly Senate - According sources, vote count passing deal containing components (except transmission line purchase, yet settled) "looks good." vote Senate would "very close." Senator Burton still opposes bail-out deal, reportedly might stand way others voting plan, making passage likely. Even opponents plan (including Burton consumer advocates) say odds modified Plan B passing Senate better 50-50. opponents reportedly "pessimistic" chances stopping Plan B passing point. 5. Caveat: Generators Waiting Guarantees Witch Hunt End - reported previously, sources continue believe generators would reluctant take 70 cent-on-the-dollar haircut without state offering relief prosecution. (Without relief, state could give 70 try take away even more.) Sources report even opponents plan accept generators offered relief prosecution. Thus, appears likely time generators would accept 30 percent haircut paid immediately. Also, sources believe securitization dedicated rate component offered modified Plan B would sufficient pay back generators successfully litigated win 70 cents dollar. - Sources believe SoCal Edison's creditors likely forebear filing involuntary bankruptcy long enough plan go through, since would pay back owed. 6. PG & E Could Also Dealt - plan succeeds, almost certainly taken bankruptcy court offered PG&E part reorganization plan. plan offered time within PG&E's "period exclusivity." 90-day period (though often extended) following filing bankruptcy petition. - However, sources report state concerned approach bankruptcy court. Based Supreme Court precedent (which legal sources within state reviewing), state would likely lose sovereign immunity entered party bankrutpcy court. problem stakes case high. 7. Bailout Bill Would Require Follow Legislation New Rate - Even state passes signs SoCal bailout, would still need pass rate structure would allow SoCal PG&E flow cost increases prevent facing bankrtupcy. Therefore, plan make crisis go away. *********** would interest? ---------------------- Forwarded Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT 06/12/2001 06:02 PM --------------------------- From: Basil Karampelas/ENRON@enronXgate 05/29/2001 11:55 Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Resume Balhorn Greg - Randy's resume. guy telling Friday walking building. think could make Enron lot money.

Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, Sarah Novosel) provided great deal information investigation Joe Hartsoe Donna Fulton discussed many problems grid new head Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC PG&E Gen). Commission obligation take Staff's recommendations, Commission typically looks Staff guidance transmission market issues. Importantly, Staff concludes Commission consider options Southeast Midwest -- Enron asking FERC implement several years: Reduce advantages network service point point service requiring native load served tariff transmission services eliminate current incentives VIUs favor native load calculation ATC handling interconnection requests. Staff Hotline used productively, Commission direct Staff conduct formal investigations entities pattern complaints. Commission could require TPs submit tariff provisions containing pro forma interconnection process specific interconnection, rather simply relying Tennessee Power order utilizes OATT timelines procedures. Require TPs retain real-time transmission data market functions pertaining daily load, internal generation meet load, imports exports. RTOs submit basis methods calculating ATC TTC, well standardized criteria curtailment. addition, since even standardized criteria might "get root problem" -- control area still control -- Commission could require RTO set date certain create one control area. Regardless implementation two options, Commission could standardize ATC TTC methodology. Staff finds electricity commodity market characteristics similar many commodities, still viewed "different," reaction price caps. Staff encourages basic decisions regulatory model made order complete transition traditional cost-of-service model model uses markets price commodity services. DETAILS (Also, reports contain good summaries generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. issues region): Midwest: Midwest dominated vertically integrated Providers ("TPs") control transmission, generation load. "As such, weak economic incentives provide access transmission service third-parties strong incentives favor services." Staff received numerous complaints; however, due lack information available TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether isolated incidents wide-spread. least, complaints indicate lack bulk power market ability market participants rely transmission access, thus harming liquidity market. TLRs important transmission issue Midwest, "enormous" 2000. region showed decline load 1999 2000 growth new generation since 1998 price spikes. Even though increase generation mild weather virtually price spikes, TLRs climbed record numbers. TLRs highly concentrated: 5 flowgates account ECAR TLRs another 5 flowgates MAIN account 42% region. Notably, even though NERC procedures Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 191 TLRs Midwest show curtailment amount. total amount relief curtailments intended produce posted. Staff notes TLR rules established NERC, whose procedures voluntary enforced penalties. Commission required certain NERC standards procedures placed Open Access Transmission Tariffs Commission power enforce provisions Federal Power Act, practice Commission deferred NERC transmission reliability questions, including TLRs. TLRs inhibit optimal functioning transmission system market load least cost supplier. TLR inefficient instrument mitigating constraints -- curtailment fiat. NERC IDC result inappropriate curtailments increased loading affected flowgate. could mitigated one control area per RTO. Staff notes Midwest state commissions petition FERC price caps following 1998 price spikes. market participants believe absence price spikes single reason NUG construction increased Midwest. Market participants must keep track of, follow, plethora information order make energy deals, submit reservations provide schedules service. Staff received many complaints barriers transmission access, including TLR curtailments standardized information protocols, particularly ATC interconnection requests, discriminatory conduct. key data unavailable Staff, coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots days TLRs called, import/export data. lack data creates market inefficiency, neither market participants regulators fully analyze market conditions real time. such, market risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals short-term transactions. Staff also noted Coordinators often work IOU, mixed incentive enforce reliability grid maximize profit IOU. (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Stretching Rules Fun Profit.") Staff cites lack information OASIS NERC web site, particularly real time TLRs curtailments. Examples provided Staff transmission refusals TLRs posted improper implementation TLRs causing substantial financial loss. currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate problems; however, three retain existing control areas favortism generation load. incentives continue remain RTO exercises complete autonomy transmission control security coordinator functions. Staff notes Midwest balkanized region control areas uniform method calculating ATC CBM. result ATCs different 2 different sides interface. Staff notes examples inaccurate ATCs states Staff's ATC audit summer consistent market complaints. Staff weighing follow-up options. result problems lack liquidity. Staff next noted problems unfiled "business especially next hour market. Staff's OASIS sites revealed several areas non-compliance. transparency necessary market function efficiently, equal timely access data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, load flow input data. TPs incentives resist efforts make information transparent native load. incentive still exist RTOs utilities allowed calculate ATC. *** "As consequence, Commission may wish eliminate native load exemption transactions tariff." *** Commission could benefit access existing transmission data require TPs retain data, including current real-time network status. Interconnection Issues: IPPs need compensated VAR support. Also, Staff cites number Hotline complaints TPs seeking large deposits failing complete System Impact Studies timely. One solution RTO handle function eliminate disincentive utilities current practice requiring IPPs deal wide variety procedures inhibits free flow transactions within region. Network service inherent advantages point-to-point, citing Entergy source sink order. Commission relied "passively" receiving informal formal complaints determine discriminatory behavior occurred rather actively canvassing market participants. Staff cannot conclude discriminatory practices widespread, evidence discriminatory instances. Southeast: traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model largely persisted SE. continued control vastly reduced economic incentives facilitate IPP activities. many cases, VIUs dampened IPP involvement without violating Commission regulation due inherent flexibility current rules. Staff cites examples delays performing system impact studies, transmission hoarding name serving native load growth manipulation ATC. TPs shown little inclination improve transmission system use many TLRs. also lack market information stymied development markets SE. ATCs change constantly leads uncertainty clearinghouse electric power prices. TVA, despite taken steps participate reformed markets, acted bulwark development competitive energy markets significant TVA's size location. IPPs reported TVA's discouragement siting TVA excessive time perform studies, excessive fees, requests perform interconnection studies. addition, Staff cites Florida Sup. Ct. decision merchant plants significantly competitive market Florida. Staff discusses significant flow power Midwest SE summer. Much resulted import cheaper coal power, use gas fired peakers due higher gas prices. Peak prices radically lower summer utilities appear better prepared peak events use forward contracts, increased generation capacity line reduced number forced outages. SE utilities reported used market-based rates extensively increase sales. (Less used midwest.) SE region lacks information, retarded Staff's efforts discern truth numerous complaints transmission SE (including ATC TLRs). Market participants seem confidence SE market market region. appears justified based Staff's investigations. lack confidence discourages investment participation markets. Staff concludes Commission may need prescriptive terms transmission allocated SE RTOs, since market concerns incumbents continue dominate operations. investigation found numerous problems bad ATCs TTCs poor OASIS postings. addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data. Staff thinks additional affiliate transaction information posted. Staff could obtain summer demand data Commission's lack jurisdiction TVA difficult obtain transmission access information. investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures lack schedules arbitrary cost estimates deposits. TPs reserved huge amount network capacity, much reserved shortly IPP approached TP interconnect. Staff cites recent Skygen order Southern denied Skygen's request transmission stating option construction 80 mile 500 kv line would take 8 years complete. Staff solutions include allowing network requests IPPs limiting self-build capacity incumbent's territory. ATC variations big problem SE. SERC coordination standardized ATC long process may resolved soon without direction Commission. improved method improved communication needed. SE experienced 354% increase TLRs summer. increase raises issue whether curtailment become impediment competitive operation market SE. Staff cites information provided Charles Y. Ameren TLR implemented according NERC criteria. Staff also wonders transmission oversold since TPs generally refund transmission revenues TLRs implemented. RTOs must broad geographic area internalize much constraints. addition, RTOs adopt pricing mechanisms obviate recourse TLRs. However, control areas VIUs retain mixed incentives. *** noted Midwest report, manner load calculated weighs heavily value information. issue formation RTOs may resolve. Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, treating load equally -- placing transactions tariff may option provides right incentives provision transparent standardized information. Finally, Staff describes specific problems TVA FP&L, TVA "problem Eastern Interconnect grid. TVA transmission bottleneck due many TLRs called summer. current federal law lack Commission jurisdiction impediments development deep robust markets area. TVA simply strong incentive provide effective efficient transmission service. addition, Commission full information TVA. Staff lists number complaints TVA, including unjustifiably increasing tag deadline allowing TVA Marketing, others, sink park power. Staff concludes recent proposals TVA enhance development markets system appear great potential. Staff audit FP&L revealed violations standards conduct, including confidential information FP&L's transmission system (including interchange information entities) posted EMS systems available FPL's merchant function.

SoCal deal needs every piece place "negotiated" Davis' team, team wants amendments allowed Assembly floor quick vote. unlikely fast track strategy fails Davis, prospects transmission lines purchase deteriorate steadily (keep mind cannot even resubmitted Assembly vetted SoCal Edison attorneys). According sources, legislature going try modify Memorandum Understanding Gov. SCE. However, Senate leadership believe sufficient support pass even modified MOU. Burton reportedly believes least 6 Democrats vote along Republicans. bill gets picked apart public, uglier looks Democrats realize alone supporting it. Another problem faced legislatures deal favor state. Among things, state overpaying $1.5 transmission lines. Additionally, MOU Davis SoCal. Ed nearly matches, point point, deal Davis condemned PG&E. Asset Seizures Since PG&E bankruptcy filing, maintained asset seizures eminent domain would become major pursuit increasingly frustrated Democrats. Davis' legal office thoroughly scrubbed law eminent domain seizures everything power generating assets across California existing power contracts negotiated by, Davis's calls, "profiteering power brokers". course, everyone Governor's office understands seizing would immediately end state federal courts, would legal nightmare (there minor Constitutional, legal interstate commerce problems). main thing seizing would continue Davis's main approach problem -- management press conference -- would put Governor Democrats right side issue -- punishing capitalist leeches. According one senior Democratic legislator, movement within Democratic members Assembly demand Davis agree seize power contracts return vote favor power transmission purchase. course, taking contracts would setting precedent taking power plants. appeal seizing contracts would allegedly put California state charge power sold reduce mark-ups substantially used contract power authority provide spot-market power purchases peak emergency conditions price roof. Price Caps One strong indication whether summer price caps occur depends powerfully decisions made three Republican Governors Colorado, Alaska Wyoming. three key players Portland Western Governor's Conference last January and, according senior White House officials, took personal prolonged intervention President Bush peel three away otherwise unanimous call price caps governors. "If signed price cap appeal," administration source said, "we would price caps. start make clear something changed, listen." Sources indicate Republican leaders begin rethink opposition price caps, Bush administration forced reconsider price caps remedy West. Cost Plus Caps -- Think Republican price caps first duty make sure private companies make money incentives provide power affected grid. give idea magnitudes cost plus deal, current discussions would put cap power costs something like $250 per kilowatt hour. long way August futures contract pricing $750 per kilowatt hour, long way last August's $150/kwhr price particularly long way cost generating power, something like $25-30/kwh. Market-Price Exceptions -- option allows Bush political credit imposing price caps. write, FERC currently ,in process considering permit renewals five companies generating power California (Duke, Dynegy, AES, Reliant Williams). permit grants three-year waiver allows sell power California existing "whatever price bear". words, FERC could simply grant companies right sell energy market price, perhaps changing definition controlling market share, power control prices would revert back FERC. Technically, granting extension permits, FERC establish formal finding five power companies wield "market power" -- cannot affect price energy withholding power crucial times. course, FERC found three different rulings last four months companies wield exactly kind ability market prices ordered minor rebates adjust subsequent price spikes. would mean FERC would want wield power price capping California shown desire front. escape clause FERC simply renew waivers routinely renewed unless company applying waivers controls 20% electricity market none companies come close. words, waivers option lets FERC escape Bush administration FERC commissioners really want escape. again, may hands three Republican Governors anywhere else country. certain past days Administration officials become fully aware potential political liabilities nothing except advocating nuclear coal power plants. Democrats Seize Opportunity blame Bush Senior political leaders think total energy bill year could come high $60 billion, would destroy state finances decade. Add constant drumbeat numbers voters hear everyday direct out-of-pocket electricity costs (they paid $7 billion electricity 1999, $27 billion 2000 expected pay $70 billion year -- ten times rate two years ago. Then, course, open bills massive rate increases bring incredible numbers home direct way, and, well, blame Democrats saying simple solution, White House allow it. National level Democrats realize California,s power crisis prime opportunity chastise Bush administration free-market advocate, FERC Chairman Hebert, resistance summer price caps. California,s leaders calculate year's taxpayer energy bill potentially $60 billion, rogue's gallery Democratic congressional leaders currently meeting Governor Davis coordinating efforts fan across eight states power grid singular message: "the western voters electricity problems lies right Washington DC, FERC headquarters controlled Bush Administration appointees." political dialogue takes aggressive national tone possible impact control US Congress comes focus, solutions articulated California's Democrats sense Republicans run West become less less "free market" focused. two strains Democratic solution becoming unavoidable part energy picture asset seizures price caps. *********** Ken, Attached redline might make review easier. want forward one Hanover.

ISO wants Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoke generators' authority charge market-based rates power supply. Tom Williams, spokesman Duke Energy, said company received FERC filing reviewing allegations. "We've obviously got filing we're reviewing going respond FERC filing. we're also gratified market forces work California prices come down," said. Richard Wheatley, spokesman Reliant, said ISO's allegations "nothing new." "It's similar nature issues allegations raised generators," Wheatley said. "The ISO incorrect asking emergency relief. situation California remains imbalance supply demand. blame game prohibits lasting solutions reached business climate California affected finger pointing."

FERC set market mitigation plan, went effect 1, stabilize wholesale power prices operating reserves dip 7%. Robinson said plan good enough.
