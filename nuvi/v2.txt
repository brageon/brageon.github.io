yeah we he plant we plant quite a bit and we have the you know peach tree and a plum tree and so oh do you get get a good crop of plums uh well we just planted the plum tree this year so we haven't uh haven't gotten anything off of that hopefully this will be the first year for our peaches we're hoping to get something off of that so oh hadn't gotten any um yeah um yeah sounds nice i used it we we had some wild plum trees growing in a field when i was a near my house when i was a kid we used to go out there and raid it oh uh-huh that's great love plums yeah we uh i i love plums and peach i just love all fruit you know yeah and it's hard to come you know the i don't know the fruit we get down here at the store has just been pretty lousy lately so yeah it's like yeah it's same around here too makes you wonder what they're what they're sending out i mean yeah where is it yeah like where does all the good stuff go yeah where is it i know they have to grow some of it because certainly they're not using it for juices and stuff i mean they use the junk for that it makes me wonder gosh if they're using junk for that what are we getting here uh-huh yeah what are we yeah yeah hat's in the juice this is what i would put in juice oh really yeah i i've gotten to where i won't even buy juices anymore because i'm afraid of what's in there uh-huh that's so true yeah well i don't do very much gardening i i would like to but i just don't have the time to do it or keep it up right i i try to get into some flowers and stuff i just uh-huh yeah uh-huh placed an order again for some bulbs and waiting for those to show up and uh-huh yeah we got some bulbs but we haven't gotten them planted uh my husband's uh been growing uh lots of flowers from seed and um-hum all of his own plants under a a light he put out in the garage to help keep them you know alive and get them a good start so we hope we have a lot of flowers this year so um-hum um-hum well i started yeah i started some about uh about a month ago and had them in little planters all over the house and my cats got to them and that was the end of them uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah we don't have any pets so yeah these these two cats it's hard to keep anything around yeah like my husband says we just have two kids it's hard to keep them out of things let alone pets yeah really these these these cats are just about as bad as kids i've got one that can even open the cupboard doors and get in inside the cabinets oh no that's no fun yeah she's yeah she's got it wired now she jumps up on the counter and stands up reaches up for the door and pulls on it till it opens and then jumps up in there uh-huh oh you ought to you ought to send a videotape that and send it into America's Home Videos yeah i know i i've been seeing all these weird things they send in and uh i says gee i ought to get that that's right you you know that could be worth ten thousand dollars so um you never know kitty cat what do you think about being a star i'll buy you buy you lots of cat food with that that's right yeah that's right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you don't have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and yeah you believe that oh yeah yeah so that's it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because you're always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah yeah and all that stuff well i'm i'm pretty easy as far as yard work i'll go out there and cut it and i'll edge it if it dies it dies uh-huh uh-huh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green it's no i uh i'll take my chances with it course now where i where i'm at now i don't have to worry about the lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it oh that's nice it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather we've had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that uh-huh yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out you know in their front yards doing their yard and yeah i guess i i guess we're really into spring now it's a perfect day for it yeah i i love spring i just love it i don't i like winter yeah i like i like cold dreary weather do you oh not me oh i don't i i grew up in Wyoming and it's cold enough there for me so yeah i it it's hum-um no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota uh-huh it's just great up there oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina no this is another one of those winters that wasn't oh winter that wasn't huh yeah it's i don't know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here but uh they didn't get a lot of snow in the mountains either uh-huh yeah no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they don't they're going to have water problems this summer so yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course we'd had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up uh-huh that's right they need the the snow for the water so because those i mean those those summers up there are brutal uh-huh terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly it's uh it's unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i and just dries everything out uh-huh i i hadn't been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me oh well it sounds like you need to move back there yeah i i've been thinking about it only problem is i i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there yeah that's that's it we'd like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany yeah yeah the uh i mean there's still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know yeah but it's hard to make it being a rancher or farmer yeah i what Brittany okay good hunting that's all right that's just another one wanting to get in on the conversation oh yeah she she was wanting oh i meant to ask you can you hear me okay on this thing okay good it's a it's a it's a headset so it makes it a little easier uh-huh yeah i hear you just fine oh yeah You doing lots of these calls you work for TI oh oh okay my husband works for T I oh no i don't i'm a i'm a student uh oh oh okay my just about everybody i've talked to has been with TI i guess that's i guess that's the same with your husband uh-huh yeah he works for them right now he's been there almost six years now yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago um came in late too it was like eleven thirty at night and i answered it and oh wow i said yeah well you know i'm not doing anything so i took it and the subject was discuss the weather and find out how your weather compares to the caller's weather i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah well the interesting thing was this was from another student at state right across town from me oh oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather i mean yeah gosh what's you weather like you know well i don't know let me look out my window yeah it's kind of foggy tonight i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and oh that ice storm yeah yeah i talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester and same story they uh they really had a lot of damage from uh ice and all that uh-huh yeah yeah they couldn't even be in the house because they had no power and everything yeah yeah that's pretty bad yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so we really had a lot to compare so oh oh sounds like that young one wants some attention oh i she's talking to my husband i think so yeah so oh oh that's okay yeah Rochester's a nice town too they they said that they had had uh lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out oh yeah that's what she said they they were going to have the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area that's too bad because i yeah yeah that's too bad because i i i had a an old an ex-professor who uh is up there in Rochester and he told me about how much they had worked to beautify the place uh-huh and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now it's all been wiped out it's a shame oh yeah it really is oh well such is life yeah it seems like you work hard and something else goes wrong nothing's forever i guess yeah exactly it's like me with gardens i can go out there and plant a garden and then watch the bugs and oh that's what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and uh-huh you get a get a frost or something hail that's even better uh-huh or hail yeah it just you know yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean i've had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons uh-huh and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever uh-huh oh my word oh was it we trew grew cantaloupe last year and that's how they were just tasteless you couldn't even eat them uh-huh cantaloupe's difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean they're they're easy enough they'll grow easy enough but you can't get any flavor yeah uh-huh yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah uh-huh and then i said well i'll try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know uh-huh yeah nope you don't it's hard to pick them uh-huh it's like oranges and everything else but anyway oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldn't buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh so uh-huh yeah they're all okay i guess we're on the air now right uh i haven't had too much experience with uh judges and jurors i've uh served on a jury one time and uh i think one of my concerns after that experience was uh finding that there tend to be people in the jury that can't bring themselves to sentence someone yes i i have my primary experience has been as uh an expert witness and and uh and two murder trials um and uh in each case it was a retrial and the sentencing was the same each time which happened in the state of Florida happened to be uh death but in terms of i well the question also was in terms of mandatory sentencing or mandatory sentences for uh certain crimes i think depending on uh in certain crimes i think that they should be mandatory for example uh armed robbery uh if we have convicted i think uh plea bargaining should should be uh a thing of the past um certain types of uh you know homicides yeah i'm inclined to agree you do need a uh fixed and clear sentence there yes in in homicides related to other than i guess what are called uh crimes of passion uh for example you know as you as you very well know the great majority of homicides are people murdering other people they know mostly people they know yeah so in those instances uh that's uh i think that there is some leeway there what was is interesting in this regard is the recent case in New Hampshire yes uh the schoolteacher um-hum and the life sentence uh she received yeah i think that was a logical decision there yes and it came very quickly surprisingly um-hum uh i guess it was uh they brought in their verdict and sentence at the same time did they not well well yeah i think they went back for a brief hearing on the sentence um-hum uh but that was that was fairly quick i think that is something that we need in this country i know the last time i was down in the Caribbean uh we had visited the island of uh Saint Thomas which is American and there were twenty three unsolved murders and nobody seem to be concerned about it um at the same time there was one unsolved murder on the island of Tortola and the whole island wanted to know when the hanging was going to take place well in answer to you know answer to the question though i still think the sentencing should be in the hands of the jury even though as you say there are some uh people who are reluctant i do not think again in the matter of uh uh that that judges should have the uh the upper hand or the only hand in that sense because i think if but i i've never served on a jury you probably know this better than i um if the jury does their job and of course there are those on the jury that do not i'm sure but and ask the questions and uh correctly and then one of things i've always wondered is uh the ability of jurors to to ask questions i've never uh really been sure that a juror is entitled to ask a question well that that that and that's an interesting point i've never i you know i've thought about it i've asked myself you know this question before i've never taken the time to do the research to answer my own question but i know that at least during the deliberations of the jury um-hum they can ask questions yes i don't know whether they can go back and call witnesses for that though it's it depends on the the transcript they can ask uh points of order of law um-hum and maybe they can ask for a review of the transcript right uh but uh asking questions during the trial my experience as a juror uh well it was a traffic situation uh there were three points of law that had to be made and the County Attorney did not make the points um-hum but the uh defendant took the stand on his own behalf unfortunately he made the points himself in his own testimony um-hum may i ask you a question um-hum why does your voice sound familiar to me um i work for E Systems that's that's probably why it does i work for GTE okay your your voice you know when uh i didn't recognize the name but the more i listen to your voice i uh i know i have heard it somewhere and i was trying to place where i had heard it that's very interesting but now back to the topic okay but uh because i work for uh Hal Ammon oh i know Hal Ammon quite well yes i am on staff to Hal Ammon to GTE okay so well say hi to Al or Hal the next time you see him i i will and which will probably be the uh Monday as a matter of fact and tell yeah well tell him that Bill Mayhood sell hi said hi okay Bill i recognize the name now i and uh my name is Jim Moscow okay and uh so i've heard the name and uh well back to the topic i guess we've talked long enough Bill all right but uh all right well thank you for calling and nice and have a good weekend thank you good night good-bye well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News and i try to look at it if i get busy i don't get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been untouched haven't been touched but uh well do you have time to read the paper in the morning well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something you know a lot a lot of people don't take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we've been taking the Times Herald for ages and then um-hum uh dog just ran off with my shoe that's off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn't read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines well we i don't take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at like the nine o'clock PM and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage well he didn't have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that's why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we're taking that and and we also hit the Garland uh-huh Garland Daily News i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this uh-huh as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial hum and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don't control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and uh-huh well i wouldn't think that i would really say that that's not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates yes and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you'll have a variety to choose from yes and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a a ploy which was um i i find that fascinating that uh um-hum yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now um-hum no i don't it's on eleven ninety hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um well when i go to work i listen yeah my husband does and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it's something really interesting and and then i'll know to yeah to keep an eye out for it but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio well with with your you know if you're around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything um-hum and and so it's kind of a oh that's what's interesting is the CNN uh i don't think i'm trying to think if it's much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i'm i'm inveterate switcher uh-huh that ninety eight point seven i'm i'm eclectic approach do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television well i watch channel five but that has to be that's another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i'm not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so um-hum um well i am we're fairly new to the area and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then um-hum they've been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i i don't know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer a you know some females i don't recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don't know if you kept up but he's been protesting that um-hum yes i have
