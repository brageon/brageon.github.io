so that's quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them up and yeah show them Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh yeah and just be right there huh Franklin Square yeah well uh we're not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um hire a sailboat with a captain since we're not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean um well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins right yeah uh that's uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh if you have a little even a little bit of experience uh i've seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis uh-huh where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla and charter a boat for a week and they take it out and have a grand time yeah uh it's fairly sheltered waters right there and uh you don't need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down i've always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i i think i would like the sailboat um-hum uh i've been there several times uh the first trip uh we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five um and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home which do you think is best American or British Virgins i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins uh-huh uh there's uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot uh-huh uh the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh which is very easy to get into and there's some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving yeah yeah that's neat and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive like uh i think they're probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now ooh that's getting up there and uh it's there kind of a nice place to visit uh uh it's better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else everything yeah that's why i think it would be neat um well i'd recommend it sounds good okay so do you have do you have the long i guess not not if there's see i was raised in New York but i guess up there you all don't have too long of a growing season do you uh well we probably have about three months do you do you do you do your own gardening approximately um-hum um-hum we live on a used to be a farm but we don't farm much we uh but we do have a garden huh see i got mine in well let's see i put in pepper plants this weekend oh i wish i could be doing that and uh yeah i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen and uh-huh i enjoy tinkering with it you know it's pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes so but you know we don't do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but uh-huh you right yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks uh-huh as soon as we're sure we're not going to have another freeze then i'll finish it yeah you've had more freezing this winter or this yeah winter i think yeah we've had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April and it's pretty tough more bad weather um-hum um-hum um-hum are you do you work or are you retired or you no i work um i'm only forty years old i have to work uh uh my husbands retired but he's not a gardener he he he's been helping me more but he really isn't real uh real crazy about gardening well but i i really enjoy it it gives me time outdoors and you know i'm a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house and and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh uh-huh getting ready to start to for the Spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn it's a lot of work you know but it's um-hum huh oh yeah but it's a pleasure to like you said it's good to get outside and yeah it is and i like i like my garden too we didn't have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space and uh-huh we we didn't have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn't get too much oh yeah corn last year we're going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so uh-huh but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that's five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side uh-huh and then i put uh like a black plastic it's really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that oh uh-huh hum and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week um-hum um-hum oh that's great and it's pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting uh-huh uh-huh yeah we don't we don't usually cover ours we did a few different times sometimes we've covered with the plastic and other years we've tried newspapers and uh but we generally don't we do our watering from our spring oh uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it's down and then it stops oh you have a spring how nice uh-huh and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden oh that's uh that's pretty nice with so but you actually enjoy it huh oh i do i love it get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around i'd rather be doing that than housework i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or uh not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the yeah with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and haven't figured out how to get rid of those yet uh uh-huh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides yeah i try to no i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i can't manage uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know it's just the it's just a lawn if uh-huh do you eat any of them yeah yeah well mine's full of dandelions now so no i never have i don't know how to prepare them oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad no huh-uh oh it's delicious and it goes real good on dandelions um-hum really huh i've never eaten dandelions now i've tried dandelion wine um-hum uh but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat uh-huh this is use the greens and you get them when they're young and tender you know before they have grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy yeah all right but u h they're kind of fun to to try get a get a few and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes yeah i'll try that i sure will yeah yeah oh i don't know uh but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back and he's been having trouble with so wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass oh oh you and we have we have hills i'm afraid of the hills but i'm getting on to it i just pretend they're not there and i just go ahead and do it so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh yeah yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre uh-huh and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i've got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends uh-huh oh that's great great that's a lot of people don't have that much space even no and it's nice i'm just inside the city limits i'm probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i'm only a mile and a half from work that uh-huh so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also yeah it's pretty nice i have the room outside i need and i don't really have all the room in the house i need but uh-huh well you never have enough room do you think no no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the they called uh roly-poly bugs that's what my son calls them anyway uh-huh roly-poly what roly-poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball i don't know what they're called is it a bug you mean they look like they've got yeah no no it's not like a no a worm a cut worm not a grub worm you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it's moist and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball oh i don't know what they call them but i'm plagued with those things down here and i haven't figured out i even called the nursery either though see um um-hum i'm trying to think of what they are what kind they could be i i don't know you find them under bricks usually and that yeah under bricks or under wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around no they're not a slug not a a slug is actually kind of slimy and and these are just he plays with them all time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio yeah yeah yeah oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm no no they're not real hard they're not a hard huh they're like a a water bug of sorts i don't know what they're called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up oh are they black then but they roll up i can't think of what kind they would be uh-huh i'm no help on that then because i can't think of what they are but i'm plagued with those what they would be but i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have you know i think it's because probably because we're in more of a tempered zone you know we don't really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens yeah i got fire ants too and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we're not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh yeah you keep trading them yeah uh-huh uh-huh ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they're they're big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they're just beginning to come out the end bud yeah yeah yeah see mine are up and bloomed already oh and they sure are pretty i like them and the Snap Dragons are starting to come up oh oh they're such a nice bright early spring color yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies um-hum um-hum and they bloom in you know late June mid July and they're yeah they are they're real nice but they're they're nice and green you know they're up above a foot maybe eighteen inches um-hum and they're beautiful too yeah they're beautiful uh-huh oh my they come up real pretty every year no problem yeah no we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah we're having it's raining today is it still pretty cool up there yeah well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn't plant anything it's just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even okay yeah see we i have Bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but and uh uh-huh um-hum it's probably very pretty Bermuda seems to be yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good down here uh-huh uh-huh we have some people that have done their lawns and and uh in Carolina and i've had Baltimore Maryland so wow that's great you're just getting all over the country aren't you i'm a non Texas Instruments employee and i always i always feel like when i get someone in Texas that you're probably employed by oh really yes i am i am yeah well i was surprised that they had their people their own people in the survey but then why not well i didn't realize that i thought all of it was TI employees in the survey i i didn't i was the other way around i thought i didn't realize there were outside people in the survey so oh i see uh do you know what they're doing with all this when they're finished um i am not positive um i i probably have gotten about the same information you have because i don't work anywhere even near that division i'm in even even in a completely different site so um-hum i know that that once they get through with this i i've read where they're they may call certain certain people back for like the second phase or something i'm but i'm not really sure i mean i know do you know why they're you gathering the information right no i don't oh you don't what they're what they're working on is uh the way i understand it is the computer system that you know in the future and who knows how far in the future they they believe that computers will be able to understand human voice where instead of having to have a keyboard and press in what you want the computer to do oh i see you'll be able to tell it what you want it to do and that's why they're gathering the voices in order to do research to enable computers to be able to do that uh in other words they want to know if our voice can direct a machine right that's exactly right well gosh i couldn't direct children i doubt that i can direct a machine are you in Dallas then direct a machine huh um i'm in Lewisville which is just north of Dallas just about thirty minutes north of Dallas yeah so north of Dallas yeah we uh just came home from an expensive trip west and drove through the Dallas Fort Worth area without uh stopping for any reason whatsoever and i did you we're our town is five thousand so i was very concerned about what the trip the traffic would be like around Dallas Fort Worth and gosh we were through there before we even realized that we were in heavy traffic so you've got a good system sure yeah yeah we really do we really do unless you're doing it first thing in the morning or last thing in the evening you know but it's that way anywhere right there is that time of day isn't there uh there is there is it's that way anywhere you go shall we get on to nursing homes yeah that's fine go ahead okay uh my mother is seventy will be seventy nine years old this fall and has been a nursing home resident for nearly three years oh my goodness oh really so uh i feel like i have uh my decision was not i did not make the decision to send her to a nursing home she made the decision that she could not any longer live in in her apartment by herself she had long since given up her home and gone into an apartment and of course that was her decision at the time too so uh-huh uh-huh and then in that we are in a small royal a rural community i think that makes such a difference too because well as a matter of fact my daughter is now the assistant director of nurses at that nursing home oh wow how wonderful she yes yes she wasn't at the time uh-huh but she has since gone to that nursing home so i just feel that i did not have any of the trauma that people talk about you sound like you've gotten very lucky you really have well it just did a really marvelous thing and mother's mind is good it's her body that's bad and uh yeah good uh-huh for to have the responsibility of putting someone in a nursing home whose mind was not good and could not tell you if they were being mistreated or something it just would all be so different uh-huh yeah oh definitely we kind of went through a situation with my father my father was a um diabetic he was pronounced a diabetic when he was thirty and uh had diabetes for all you know many many years and hum you know didn't take quite as good care of himself in the beginning as he should have i mean he was put on insulin immediately but his diet he wasn't as careful with as he should have been in the beginning so he deteriorated rather quickly and hum by the time he was in his mid fifties which is very young he was he was nearly blind and was going into kidney failure and couldn't um-hum couldn't walk for very long periods of time the muscles in his neck and that type of thing had deteriorated to the point that he always had to have something to lean his head back against and and you know we were you know myself and my two sisters were um you know in the situation of a a fifty seven year old father looking in to put him in a nursing home which was which was at fifty i'm know it's scary isn't it yeah i mean it was i'm fifty seven right it was just a horrible situation for us to both you know to be in and we just you know because of course like you say like your mother his mind was was perfect and wonderful it was he just could not get around to take care of himself um and uh we ended up opting for um a live-in nurse and you know that came into his home and and we set her up a room in a spare room and she stayed there with him instead because we just could not imagine a fifty seven year old man in a nursing home we just you know we just could not could not imagine doing it um and we knew that it wouldn't you know we couldn't even do the the live-in nurse thing forever you know and but he was just so against and and when you said your mother knew that this is probably where she needed to be it was such a different story because he was um-hum so against going to a nursing home which at that age i can't blame him you know it would just it just scared him to death to be you know that young and who knows you know the thought of being there another twenty or thirty years you know just was was just um-hum um-hum yeah yeah too much for him you know so we you know we opted for that route so i kind of know what you mean about the the trauma of you know the thought of doing it you know it was just um-hum it was just very hard but i guess you know there's there's there's good ones and there's bad ones i think you just have to be so very careful you know and um-hum you know you're lucky if you do have a situation where the mind is is still good and they can tell you if they're being well taken care of i think otherwise you you end up with serious problems um in our locality we have a lot of uh government services like the Home Health Care and etcetera etcetera which i'm sure they do in cities too you know uh-huh um-hum but we do not have the staff to draw from from to find someone who could stay for day in and day out with they we just don't have those people uh-huh they just are not available even though you would like to make that choice uh-huh well you know that was another situation because my this was my father lived in Missouri and was in a little small town of about three thousand and uh we just got very very lucky and found a woman who was willing to do this and you know someone that we had known from you know had lived in town you know that same town forever and we knew very well and we knew her history and we knew that she wasn't going to steal
