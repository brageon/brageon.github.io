Dunleavy no yeah he didn't they didn't let him have quite the the flair that uh Mike Riley had huh-uh Mike Riley was it and that's well Dunleavy's a good coach though he was he's good it's just he's not he's not Riley and i think that's the biggest problem is eventually they're going to have to figure out what they need to do and catch on to each other yeah well he doesn't have that Hollywood attitude huh-uh would uh no i'm pretty familiar with with Dunleavy because he was an assistant at Milwaukee oh was he uh yeah and he uh when when they had uh injury problems with some of their major players uh he actually put on a uniform and went out and played oh my goodness they they signed him to a ten day contract and uh he became a player even though he's assistant coach huh-uh that's all right then the guy knows basketball i think he'll do all right for the Lakers huh boy you you like basketball though don't you oh yeah oh yeah it's fun i'm watching the i'm i'm busy watching the NC double A tournament uh the past couple weeks uh-huh and the NIT semifinals are on tonight yeah see now i watch the the Final Four uh-huh once it gets down to like the Final Four yeah right so are any of those teams of interest to you UNLV i like them oh yeah well they're they're just i guess because well that guy is from Dallas that's probably about the only thing yeah that's it that's the only reason why i don't know anybody else Larry Johnson right well they're just head and shoulders above everybody else this year are they really oh yeah they're they're so much better than anybody else it's uh that they're prohibitive favorites in winning all their games but then you know just like that man said in this final in these in the NCAA whatever it is the little play-off games they play so many sometimes i do think it's going to be more it's luck and ambition you know right well it's it's just unbelievable how many games they play in in college now Arkansas played thirty four games this year that's almost half of a pro season yeah see that's that's too many games it's too many for students you know and and then they supposed to be studying right you know they're talking tonight about this NIT game with Stanford and Massachusetts that the Stanford players actually took their final exams while they were on the road playing basketball uh-huh are you serious they have an honor system there where they would they had uh three hours to take their exams they sent them in by uh by fax and uh i guess by they used laptop computers to uh to get their exams finished uh-huh hum send them out by Federal Express and fax machine i don't think that's good yeah it's incredible that uh that they have to do that i mean some of the the schools give you a break they give the students a break where they can take their exams when they get back from from a tournament uh-huh but uh these guys were actually on the road uh two thousand miles from from home when they had to file their uh their final exams and send them in yeah i don't think that's i don't think that's good yeah that and then you know the laptop that's how i guess they really stuck it on a disk the teacher you know with no answers and they could take it like that and then just print it out in fax and it would be okay because you can put it on a you know on diskette yeah and just have them take it but then who's helping them yep i don't know so do you think uh you think Vegas is going to win the finals then see now that's yep i think so too they plaid Duke and uh Duke has a lot to uh to atone for here last year that lost to Vegas in the finals by thirty points in that the other one that upset that was an upset was Kansas last night Kansas is a real surprise i didn't expect them to get that far when they yeah i didn't think they was going to beat that team i don't remember the team but they shouldn't have beat them uh they beat Arkansas yeah i didn't uh yeah that that i like i like Arkansas Arkansas just uh they had a rough second half yeah they came out uh real hot in the first half Todd Davis hitting his three pointers and it was like they just died or something you know yeah uh somebody took the fire out from under them they they weren't getting their shots anymore huh-uh and and Kansas just crept up on them and uh uh it was unbelievable because they they did that a few years ago too when they were seated a lot lower and they won the the championship that's it um-hum see now that's the that's the thing now but i don't think they everybody's waiting for UNLV yeah well they they are just that much better they've got so many stars and see if Kansas if Kansas yeah but then you know it could be what if they're not hitting that night or they're low or anything and see i i feel like the college you know it's kids it's still kids well sure i think anybody can can win on a given night but they have so much talents and the average age on that team is twenty two years old they've got a lot of fifth year seniors that are playing so yeah they just take them out think that that'd be all right guys that are playing for long time uh they're playing Duke uh this weekend uh the average age on Duke's team is nineteen years old um-hum um-hum Vegas the average age is over twenty two so they've got just so much more experience than anybody else in the tournament right now but they're going to lose all those guys at the end of the season they're going to all turn pro i think Stacy Augmon's a senior and Larry Johnson i don't think i think he's uh is he a senior or junior yeah who i'm not Larry Johnson i think he's coming out this year he's yeah he's coming out in the pros this year uh-huh and Anderson Hunt all their uh their best players i think are graduating um-hum well maybe not graduating but at least they'll be entering the the pro draft i don't i think i think he's going to move i think he'll probably go he now Larry Johnson is definitely going to the pros oh yeah for sure yeah and uh there's some more that i don't i can't think of their names God my girlfriend she she gets me because i can describe them go you know that guy you know and she'll name them for me George Akals and Stacy Augmon yeah now they'll come out in the pros Anderson Hunt they'll come out uh-huh they're half they're team is going to be gone now and see that's another thing for next year with UNLV they're not going to have no team uh well i wouldn't say that i i think well i mean as far as the the top players you know like the ones they have this year you know yeah their coach may not be there i think Jerry Tarkenyon may be headed for the pros yeah he's nice there's some talk that he may be uh coaching for the LA Clippers next year uh the Clippers that's another team and i don't think they've ever done anything they have a great amount of talent but they just have poor coaching i think but um no coaching yeah that's all right they've got some great players on that team that be all right between them and i just think that yeah then there's that uh let's see i like the Lakers Milwaukee Atlanta Hawks i like them too uh-huh i like probably uh the Houston Rockets shocked me the the i think it was last year when they uh last last year they beat LA last year uh-huh well Houston's playing really well lately yeah last couple of weeks anyway since Akeem because i know my sister's in LA see and she calls me up and tells me well LA's going to come down there and beat up on Texas you know and i said yeah and so when they came down so what happened it took them a long time they beat them uh-huh but it was like four out of the three seven games they had to play the seven games for the for the thing you know just to beat them so it was like one game over sure i think Houston's playing really good ball lately uh-huh ever since Akeem changed his uh first name to Hakeem he added the H to the front his attitude i don't know i don't know them people well uh i can understand that it's uh i don't know why he dropped it in the first place but uh i don't either if it was his name he should have just kept it i you know that's your name that's your name sure so who do you think's going to win the NBA this year hopefully i don't think the Lakers are going to win but i think um oh what's his Portland Portland's looking awfully good no not Portland what's that team with the little guy with uh the no Isiah Isiah Thomas Detroit yeah Detroit Pistons they're not as good as they were last year i don't know i think they'll go i think they'll they're good but they're not great but i think they'll they'll have to pick it up in the in the tournament then but i think that's what usually happens to them Chicago's playing really good ball with Michael Jordan um-hum and i think they finally put things together yeah they did good last night last night they had like a hundred and something to eighty so they they was playing real good last night yeah well Chicago they they've been struggling last couple of years and they've had a good team for the past few years ever since they had Michael Jordan but they never did seem to make an impact on the play-offs yeah i think this year they're going to really uh show some talent i think also because they done took some of the pressure off of him oh yeah you know they because they always think it's all him and see there's not you know it's not true they have a good supporting cast that's not good but i mean everybody's always looking at him that's just like Larry Bird and um uh God Larry Bird what team does he play for Celtics Boston Celtics right yeah see because they put a lot on Larry Bird um-hum yeah i don't think the Celtics quite have the overall talent that it takes to win the NBA this year hum-um they've got good individual players but some are getting old Robert Parish is thirty seven years old yep he's still playing center and uh Larry Bird's talking about retirement here i guess in another year well he's out i mean he's hurt this year yeah so you know you never know but they're bringing in some good young players too yeah which is good um-hum i'm i've always favored Milwaukee being from that area and they've made some good moves in personnel but i don't see them as having the the type of talent that will win the NBA this year yeah they have to get by Detroit and Chicago i think either one of them is a real tough challenge for them yep if they get by Detroit i think they can get by by uh Atlanta but yeah i don't think Atlanta would be much as much a problem as Chicago well that's what i meant yeah they get by Chicago hey can get by Atlanta uh-huh it would it if you can beat Chicago Atlanta shouldn't be that much different right you just slow down Isiah Thomas and Atlanta is um they got what um i think uh i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson uh-huh okay and from what i understand it's it's a new thing good about families these days um especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble yeah because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know yeah i i'm i'm pretty busy myself i'm in graduate school at State and i uh-huh i can't see even having time for a pet let alone children yeah really but um there's a lot of single parents too that are trying yeah i think day care seems to be uh yeah a real big issue yeah and uh i'm not sure or i just wonder when we'll know what the effects of day care yeah well actually there's been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the students the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time yeah so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don't have real good uh role models yeah i've heard that they they call them uh that they say that they're more um creative that they're really just more rebellious um-hum from the day care yeah because uh the people don't have the time to give that one-on-one attention yeah and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come into more and more uh homes i can i can see that happening yeah because really if you have a good curriculum yeah do you really need to have that certification yeah of a teacher i taught i taught school for a year and it was like whoops you know it's not for me no because i i just don't have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn right um-hum and uh i one day i was i like found myself uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that you know something that that's how you know you're a bad teacher um and i was doing it just keep them occupied yeah i think another problem with the families uh is is the role of television yeah um i don't know it seems they're using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool that really that really annoys me because i think i don't know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit yeah um using it as a baby a babysitter yeah it's just go watch TV you know leave us alone yeah will numb you out which well i've i've heard some uh there's a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control um-hum and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for children's programs oh yeah and yet uh children can't buy uh what's the deal yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain right i'm watching Ninja Turtles i know it yeah and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous yeah i could be and they all have to have the same one you know i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood say oh yeah here kid this is this is all you're getting i wonder how long that last well i i used to babysit for this family that didn't have a TV and their their kids turned out fine they didn't have a TV at all they they had no TV were they Pentecostal no i mean they had a nice stereo they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson yeah they just yeah they just didn't watch him on TV yeah which i thought was pretty neat yeah it is it's very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us especially the the violence on it i've yeah yeah and you can't control it you you know it's the cable channels sometimes you can but yeah boy the cable TV they'll just show anything yeah and that's coming right into your homes yeah i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on they're watching good shows uh-huh yeah PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesn't happen in real life yeah yeah and there's a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isn't there yeah killing their parents and so forth they don't they see these things happening with no consequences huh you know yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards yeah yeah like Double O Seven he's supposed to do it yeah and it's okay yeah so i you going to have kids in the future huh you going to have kids in the future no huh-uh because i'm like forty three okay and so it's uh it's too late yeah you know i wonder sometimes wonder if i'll ever if i will regret it when i'm old but uh i just can't see myself as a parent uh-huh yeah you know it's i'm still pretty young i'm twenty five but i don't know i don't see it for for at least a few years really are you married no i'm single right now and i'm you know sorting things out which way i'm going to go with my life before i yeah have kids you know career to to much into my career you know yeah well i wish you the best okay well it's good talking to you it's good talking to you bye-bye all right bye-bye okay so what do you think about us getting involved in the Middle East i don't think we have any choice oh i don't think we did really either as long as we do it in a logical manner rather than what we did in Vietnam except jack around with it well that's that's true yeah the uh the the biggest difference i got to agree was the idea that we were allowed to go and get it done rather than than set up a a line and say we're not going to let you cross this this point anymore and that really hurt the uh the people uh the Vietnam experience uh i got to admit that one i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that Bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything uh-huh well do you think that um by uh going over there and doing what we did that uh it's going to give us a chance for peace over there i don't think there's ever going to be peace in in the Middle East yeah that kind of mostly it it just that that region never had peace even as far back in biblical times it's never been peaceful well that's um-hum you know the Arabs just don't like the Jews and the Jews don't like the Arabs and then half the Arabs don't like the other Arabs but is i mean is that any different than uh the way it is in even our country i mean uh back in the fifties and forties the blacks didn't like the whites the whites didn't like the blacks but we're getting to the point where we get along pretty good i mean isn't it logical that just any of the that you can solve differences like that no because you i i don't think the Mideast has the educational background i i i don't think they're later they're rate of literacy is so low that they're still they still have a trouble mentality so you um-hum so you think it comes down to education or or something like that well well you don't find many intelligent people starting wars you know i suppose that's probably true you know uh basically the more intelligent people do not want to fight one uh because they've already been there all you have to do is go fight one and find out it's not much fun i've spent uh over twenty eight months in Vietnam so and i mean it's not it's not a lot of fun um-hum no oh um-hum uh it's as years go by it becomes more fun now than it was twenty eight years ago you know but uh yeah because yeah i guess the uh you kind of think about the good things and not about the bad and you forget some of the smells and stuff like that but i think you know probably the probably the Middle East is if you have too many tribes mixed up with troubled mentality not only the Mideast but also in in the what they call the emergency African nations the third world um-hum um-hum right right uh as soon as one tribe gets the power they just knock off they're old ancestral enemies and it's pretty you know it's pretty much that way over the Mideast and you have the Palestinian question and there hasn't been a Palestine over there for God since you know two hundred years three hundred years before Christ was born and but but you have people that are suddenly coming out of the woodwork going oh yes we want a Palestine nation but there hasn't been one for you know well over two thousand years um-hum but you have this troubled mentality they all you know like the Kurds or the Shiite Muslims or whatever but it's basically all all based on the a a tribal network right well isn't it also though based on religion i mean isn't that a a real powerful out of some degree yeah to some degree but uh religion is a factor over there but uh i think the strongest factor is a tribe of the family um-hum well don't don't you think though that uh because of religion it just enhances the differences uh of the tribes and makes it so that it's that much harder to get along well they have the same problem we do yeah i mean you know everybody there's Christianity and then you then we have subdivided Baptists and Lutherans and Protestants and Christians and Catholics and stuff it's basically all the same um-hum uh but but the Muslims are not as liberal in their interpretation of of the Kuran as we are in our interpretation of the Bible right right you get the more the more i guess you call the more militant sect of the Shiites who you know if you're not a Muslim and and you don't adhere adhere strictly to it then you're nothing and you're just you're you're just getting lip service much like uh the Ayatollah Khomeini um-hum he's a he's a prime example oh i'd i i will but seriously doubt that that you will have peace in the Mideast as long as you have so many war infections that are they can't even agree on which facet of of uh Muslim they want to follow that's true well since there's not going to be peace over there don't you think like getting involved as we have that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it well we only we have two choices we can be involved or not involved if we're not involved then we're going to be sitting over here freezing in the dark um-hum uh we probably could with ultimate fuel supplies and uh some relaxation of our old uh policies here survive but we're not going to do that it doesn't seem that way does it no there's there
