a while if my husband and i have traveled or something um and we pick up a local paper we're really shocked even in a major city at how local it is it's really provincial yeah yeah the news is the same way the news local news here is kind of lousy is it really i mean it's not much different than when i lived in Roanoke Virginia which is really small town that's that's maybe because we get so you know we're so jaded with the Post uh yeah which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this we're we're really in an in an isolated different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean yeah that explains it but uh i probably do watch more T V because i get home and in between say cooking dinner or something if i can catch a five or six o'clock news right right i watch that usually uh before we settle down uh depending what time we get to bed we'll usually watch the ten or the eleven o'clock news we have a ten o'clock news here at night and that's ideal uh-huh um yeah because because by ten thirty i start to fade so uh i'm in graduate school so i have a really weird schedule and i don't know i really don't have time for T V and newspaper just i wouldn't i wouldn't have time to read it so i'm what are you studying like yeah i remember when i was in school yeah finding the latest thing out from my friends is usually the most uh time effective yeah yeah no i can remember way back back in those days when i was in school the i think the only time we only really watched the news and this tells you how old i was was during the Cuban missile crisis yeah uh i we could just we were all centered around that television yep what's neat is seeing history happen you know that's exactly right and i'd i guess that's it yeah although i do worry that how easy this one was might be a bad lesson uh to the to the younger people um you know than there is the other generation yeah um in North Carolina there was a lot lot of service men from here you know and people really saw that oh that's true yeah yeah saw it first hand that was probably the best part of the news was the uh some of the person human interest stories yeah some of it got a little i i don't know i thought it was a little too personal that they were digging each other life uh-huh yeah yeah little too much maybe does it does it bother you that uh at this point in your life that you're not getting more direct news or uh no not really what are you studying i'm in computer science okay yeah um i guess i see it as information age yeah how old are you i'm twenty five okay then i'm see i'm about twenty years older yeah and i really do i do rely i do miss it i do rely on the news and uh i i guess i regret i don't get enough local really local we get some local papers but i guess i'm more interested in the national or international news uh-huh it's almost getting to the point where there is there's too much that overload news overload yeah you shouldn't even worry about most of the stuff i mean i don't know it's a little near sighted but uh yeah but well it's hard i'll i'll tell you though it is hard when you go to vote i mean there are so many issues and there're so many people running that you know unless you have some way of evaluating it yeah yeah and i guess the news does help well it was really nice talking talking to you okay okay did it work out your first time all right i hope so okay alright bye-bye take care bye-bye have you had to put anyone in a nursing home no but my husband's mother was in a nursing home um and she was in there she got sick and they put her in a nursing home because you couldn't we couldn't afford a nurse to you know all all day nurse yeah twenty four hours yeah well at least as they told us uh two shifts oh you know that's sixteen hours because one would come in the morning and one would be at night i mean in the afternoon and then that night it wouldn't need one yeah yeah you know because she would be sleeping so i would be here then yeah that would seem like that would be uh more expensive than a uh nursing nursing home wouldn't it well the nursing home is covered by uh social security see oh and the nurse at home isn't oh okay i got you and the nurses aren't no see you have to pay that yeah i didn't know that and oh yeah if you put nursing home and that's another thing i you know you got to find a good nursing home is very hard to find because the people don't care most of them don't care some of them do care the work that you know the the nurse aide that what the problem is i think it's the nurses' aide they don't pay them enough to keep them there and to do the things that they need to do now well my brother in law was working with uh in one for a little bit and uh he just he couldn't handle the things he had to do uh-huh you know uh cleaning up after men uh men and women using the restroom and stuff he he he couldn't handle it oh yeah it's gets bad some of them and then it depends on the nursing home and how bad it is you know because they have some nursing home that don't have anybody that's not walking you know yeah and it just depends on how bad that person is well seems to me if a person gets into that area they i i don't know it seems like if you're going to get in that area and spend the time learning it because you do have to go to school on some of it yeah uh you ought to do your job yeah and um and if you can't if you can't i think they should get out of it instead of mistreating the people yeah i i've heard a lot of bad things about them mistreating people and uh well i've even heard of some people being sexually abused they steal yeah that and they steal yeah they steal from them uh oh yeah i used to take uh every week you know i have to threaten it which it doesn't make sense for me to have to sit there and threaten uh people um that work there i didn't yeah you know like i bring her i bought her a blanket and i had this girl hand crocheted her a lap blanket you know because she sits in a wheel chair but she can walk they just sit them in wheel chairs and i told her uh i came up there the following week and it was gone i said where is it she said in the washer i said i tell you what when i come back it better be here because they went to the washer we didn't find it i said you all better find it yeah and you know bedspread her bedspread she i took her a bedspread because she a comforter because she was always cold yeah and so uh you know then i had to put write the name on the whole bedspread i'm talking uh like it's in each square it almost you know on both sides so that they can't turn it over and put it on somebody else's bed all over that's that's not right huh-uh i've i've only known two people in a nursing home and you know it was my grandmother and grandfather on my father's side and i just heard through my father what was going on and uh yeah well see this this one i i is more or less first hand you know she just died um we buried her February but she had been in there at least i know for seven years eight years and he didn't want to put her in there but he can't afford it yeah and that's another thing you know yeah something i guess you get forced to do make decisions and but you don't have it depends on when didn't you you have a choice the only thing i can say is you have a choice of where they go sometimes yeah sometimes you don't and then you have to check out the nursing home and the only way you're going to check out a nursing home is to actually put them in there and check on them every time but don't tell the people what time you going to come in just come in uh yeah you have to do one of them you know spontaneous things like maybe three o'clock in the afternoon or one o'clock in the afternoon and stuff like that because they're not expecting you yeah yeah you know they expect you Saturday like on Saturdays Friday you know Saturdays and Sundays and Friday and stuff but not during the week yeah hum-um it gets bad it is nursing home i think is sometimes i think some people put them in there and then they just die that's about what it's for and it's really not some people don't need to be in there you know that's what i've heard too you know i heard that they just put them in there because they don't want to mess with them that's right and i don't think that's right i think they should have a place to some of the people that don't need to be in the nursing home with nurses they need to have a place for them like a retirement home well yeah i've heard uh some things you know uh i i don't where i heard it from it might have been a movie or something where they made a apartment complex into a what you're saying for people who can take care of themselves but they they uh need a little help in doing it yeah don't yeah and see that would be okay you could have somebody check on each one of them every day you know go by and see what they need yeah each of them have their own little apartment or little little place to live you know even just a little room or whatever yeah well do they share rooms in nursing homes sometimes yeah it depends on the patient and and i guess sometimes the availability of that of the room and how they done built the hospitals because i know one lady like she had a roommate but the woman across the hall didn't have one um get my purse uh but it it it you know it just to me nursing homes are um bad news bad news unless you can find a really good one and those are rare but there are some good ones and there are some bad ones i mean well i'll i'll say something i said in the last conversation i hope i'm never in that position where i have to be put in one uh from all i've heard about it just not and i've heard i told my husband well is this weird because see what people don't understand is even the people that work in the nursing home they will get old one day yeah and everything that they do to somebody will come back to them that's the way i feel yeah well if it ain't uh well you know uh or maybe that won't not make it that far in life for what they did to somebody but well yeah i have my beliefs in the hereafter and i believe that uh God will take care of them that's the whole that's what i think i think God will definitely get uh you know uh there's two people that i know you should not mess uh abuse and that's a child and a someone person that's elderly you shouldn't abuse anybody but but down right true them people them two people are the most helpless people you see what i'm saying yeah you know they can't really defend themselves like somebody grown uh say my age you know yeah or mine yeah i got you there because i can tell somebody to go leave me alone but they so old or you can force them to do it if you know yeah you can force their hand more or less but see somebody that old they don't know yeah uh and then what they what are they going to do and if they tell anybody people always say oh they're just senile you know huh-uh and that ain't right neither no it's not so it it it gets bad you know it just depends on like i said the nursing home now my grandmother was in a nursing home in California before she died but it was a nice nursing home for you know it was one of the nice ones yeah but now my mom and them had to pay for that too yeah i was going to say you have to pay something like three and four times more you have to pay more you know social security covers so much and then um you have to pay some more and she chose to pay some more well if she you know since it was like my my grandmother had thirteen kids so they all you know paid their month which was better but see my husband's a only child yeah and then he'd have to pay it all yeah yeah i know what big families are like and how they can get together if you if they're really cooperative and wanting the best if yeah see and then there's another thing she told me is you have to make sure everybody cooperates because like by her her being there if someone if one of her brothers didn't send in their check she would have to pay it yeah you know and wait for him to whenever he decide to pay it you know yeah well i know my mom from a family of at least sixteen i've lost count uh and my grandmother just died sometime last well about two years ago um-hum um-hum and uh they was all talking about pulling together and paying for the uh hospital costs and stuff and uh you know there's some of my family that's not exactly in the homeless level but you know darn close yeah yeah and uh then there's others who is uh-huh lots better off just pretty oh yeah see that's what that's what gets me like well just like my brother he has got his five bedroom house and in California with the swimming pool and here i am renting a house barely making it you know well in California too i've got a friend that lives out there and uh she's got a little two three bedroom house with a garage a double car garage and it's costing her a thousand dollars a month um-hum California is high yeah and then you know it's like i tell him you make more money than i do than i could ever really think about if i made as much money as my brother i would be just like set for life that's what we keep saying you know but not him he's never happy and i think that's that's why he makes as much as he do is because he keeps thriving for more uh well that's which i probably if i got what i wanted i'd be okay you know well that's a good initiative uh i guess if but and i guess okay um so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams well i kind of like them all i played for about eighteen years all all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college but oh i was going to say you played pro ball right no not quite not quite huh made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but well that's pretty good anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets yes i'm actually a Met's fan i'm i'm one of these people who's actually a die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater oh boy it the i think it's like one or the other isn't it i mean you either yeah it's it's i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans don't like the Yankees and real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason yeah i never found i never quite found a New York fan i've always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox oh okay by default because i went to college also in Boston i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team i'd i anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia oh i'm from New Jersey originally yeah so that that's sort of close enough yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so oh so you were pretty close right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry well i don't know um there's there's a part of me that says that you know i'm i'm sort of glad Strawberry went away you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasn't worth the baggage you know yeah um i think they're okay i think they're you know i think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to let's say you know um um-hum just eight years ago or something they're they're they're they're you know they're sort of in in good standing whereas you know um i think yeah i certainly don't think that they're the eighty six team anymore uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right yeah i right they were either beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston yeah yeah when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner yeah i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do hey the guy's making millions he ought to be able to perform right that's right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i well his knees were bothering him yeah right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy can't play you don't blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in yeah for having him out there that's right so sure so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time oh oh boy so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the National National League Championship Series but there's like two fellows oh yeah from uh Brooklyn and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know after the uh well that's good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess yeah you don't expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there um yeah really yeah so i i was i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although i'm really not okay okay well i'm not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn so i'm kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh they're they're they're they they have the i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues yeah i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium it's great well that that's actually i think that makes something because i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps yeah you know it's good to have um the only problem is it's not large enough it only holds about i think they squeezed when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there yes it is kind of small yeah so they're they're they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them to Florida but uh right they ended up sticking around in Arlington and they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so that's oh that's oh that's great so that's something that we're looking forward to yeah that'll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy oh yeah case in point Toronto and yeah exactly yeah have you seen a game up there uh i haven't been to any Toronto games yet but um oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal that's that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best i've been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um yeah uh-huh a Rochester Red Wings game now is is Rochester where where is Cornell University uh Cornell is in Ithaca Ithaca uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us okay so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of is uh yeah well Rochester's like right on the shores isn't it yeah we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldn't be a port city yeah okay okay um but that uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night oh really i never i hadn't actually known that yeah well um but we have our own um our own triple A team here yeah the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here they're the they're the big team in Rochester yeah okay yeah those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun because they're yeah lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um um-hum um-hum especially you know and i'll um i'll make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really
