get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up so now ever since then when you drive into the city most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car until they get down there and once you've reached the the river walk area which is the tourist area it's usually pretty safe during the during the day if you're just kind of cautious and don't go down the back streets or alleys and um you know or or alone if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the the river patrol cops it's very nice but at at evening um again you they have the high tourist area the river walk area which is nice but you don't want to get off the beaten track um there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage um alone oh my it sounds like um San Juan Puerto Rico we were there just well for a lay over and um well it wasn't a lay over we were we had um-hum we were we had we were staying at the other end of the island and we drove into San Juan to catch our plane it was at night and this boy really wanted to go on the beach and they look at you crazy you don't go on the beach well it's a big tourist town um-hum um-hum you know don't they don't people go for a walk on the beach at night and they said no it's very safe in the daytime but at night they even have the policemen come around at dusk um-hum um-hum and sound their sirens pretty much telling people be wary you know and get off the beach it's just so sad you know it is just really so sad you know it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more um in San Antonio i don't know what the answer is uh education i think is a lot of it um so many of the kids are are drop outs um uh there's a lot of drugs that go on and that they just have hopeless lives they they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels i think education helps a little bit there um they again i don't know really what steps there are that they well what they what they say they try to do is to get the kids um early and young and what we have here in Burlington which uh-huh it doesn't cost a lot of money but they have a kids council that they have all these after school activities for kids they set up uh-huh uh-huh kids with elderly people in the winter time they shovel their snow they have a big brother big sister program they have bottle drives they have cleanup outings uh and they have also organized fun activities like gyms going to the beach and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer and they have gyms open and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs uh-huh after school you might keep them but you again you need that one on one uh-huh like a big brother trying to keep the younger kid you know tell him hey stay in school it'll get better you know so that your mom doesn't have a job and uh-huh she doesn't work you don't know you can be better than that You don't have to live on the you know for a street life uh-huh that's good that sounds like they've got a lot going on there but yeah but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here i mean um they can deal with that scale uh-huh they might have five hundred troubled youths when you have five thousand troubled youths plus when you're getting into the well the kids now it's twelve years old and they're uh-huh selling drugs and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss that is carrying a gun uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's just it's the morals of the people which i mean i guess we everybody's responsible for the society but if i had a child that that did things so bad it's not they don't care about anybody these people they're stealing from they're just the big bad rich guy uh-huh uh-huh and we don't have it so we deserve it and we should take it uh-huh yeah i don't know how you combat that i i don't know where you start or with a lot of these kids um so many of them all they see is just the gangs and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school yeah well i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible too we're talking these kids are fourteen years old The parents might be thirty years old oh yeah uh-huh and i'm thirty years old and i'm kind of irresponsible but i have the morals that keep me from you know if i was going to go out and drink or do something i wouldn't do it in front of my child these people you know they bring their their Johns home and they bring their drugs home and the kids are just sitting there in the same room uh-huh it's just that they have absolutely no no morals and it's really sad uh-huh and i don't know how you combat that i really i don't know what the answer is to that problem you know but i like your idea of education i mean if the parents aren't supplying it they've got to get it from someone else from the schools uh-huh uh-huh yeah and what do those kids do they get it at school and come home what do they do then i i feel i feel for them i don't know how to make it better for them or you know unless because it they can't remove themselves they can't just leave and say okay well it's not acceptable i'm leaving the big city mom and i'm i'm going off you know when they're ten they have to live in it and yeah it's really sad like if they did have a big brother big sister program those those people trying to help the kids the parents might have hostilities towards them uh-huh right i think so and uh you know like you're judging us and i'm not good enough to raise my child which basically is true uh-huh it it it's i'm glad i don't live in a big city uh-huh yeah just because i mean not just because i wouldn't feel safe it's just because that i would be reminded every day of something that i don't see and i might see it on a you know a Sixty Minute special yeah uh-huh no in San Antonio it was like every day it was just a matter of who was shot that night i know it but San Antonio is considered a nice clean city believe it or not i mean they have all kinds of nice write ups about it uh-huh oh yeah but but any big city has a bad section but there's a lot of them it's very prevalent a lot of the crime is very prevalent yes they're very bold it seems uh-huh very much When we moved here to Monterrey it was a big change because it's such a small community we're just above Carmel and um there's hardly most everybody seems pretty well employed around here and um those that aren't there's Celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive which is mostly migrant workers and there's a lot of crime there um migrant Hispanic farm workers people that are down and out and uh they all seem to congregate in Celinas not so much here in Monterrey so it's it's pretty quiet you know we walk the streets at night and uh people run in the park and you know you're just have your normal smarts about you then you really don't have to worry or really even uh even in the worst crime areas in Burlington i i can walk the streets i wouldn't i if i did it every night uh-huh i think there would be trouble in our house so you wouldn't get confronted or anything right but i don't think you would uh someone might grab you mess around with you but they're not going to grab you steal your your money and slit your throat which in a lot of big cities uh-huh yeah i mean that's what you your going to have to expect that to happen people are just totally unfeeling like uh uh-huh oh uh-huh uh i didn't know that about Burlington i'll have to keep that in mind anyway uh uh do you work for a large corporation corporation well i did uh and i'm currently uh consulting now so i'm with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are uh-huh pretty basic uh medical um i don't get any profit sharing and stuff like that so i uh i work with a medium size company and we don't have profit sharing but i would enjoy it since we uh it's a service based organization so yeah it would be nice but yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh that would be nice they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits so it sounds like they're going to get very more flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no i've got a family two children yeah are you single okay uh yeah alright do you have children are you single but no i i'm uh single i'm uh never been married so you are i no i said i've never been married i'm only i'm only twenty six so oh you never have oh yeah that's there's still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but um i still got a few years we uh we've we just kind of started young in life but uh uh we uh my husband's still with the same company for ten years and as a result and it has worked out so he's got a real nice benefit package but um it's uh it's nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess so what are the most important benefits to you oh the hospitalization um is the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible's reasonable i think it's three fifty a year for the family uh-huh whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible's i think five hundred a year and it costs a lot more i'm with a smaller company though the but the medical stuff itself uh so the health plan you're with it only it only covers fifty percent that's right ouch that's the worst i've ever heard yeah it's not very good it's usually the eighty basic eighty twenty yeah besides your initial deductible that's what varies the most i guess uh yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month ha um and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co-payments that's what they are yeah co-payments type stuff yeah well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it's the most important um-hum uh coverage uh of the you know you may not even go in to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you you know to get covered is important um-hum um well if we one of our children is just is just turned two and her first eighteen months of life God well she had one operation she's been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she's she's just expensive the other one wasn't nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those yeah kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents uh-huh how about any matching programs you ever you know what i mean where they contribute contribute contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K no oh yeah yeah my husband's got that available that's great is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent i think it's fifty percent up to four percent or maybe it's fifty percent up to eighty percent okay yeah i'm not exactly sure but that that's a nice i think that's an important benefit yeah that's great uh i don't get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i didn't make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave so yeah it's nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is but uh money that you can touch but it's tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CD's and gets life it's a it's a term life policy also uh-huh with an annuity yeah yeah yeah that's what it is you know about insurance i didn't know anything about insurance until i had got until i had children yeah i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is when i was in school still uh-huh i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren't very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could really and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh uh-huh they would uh you know analyze it the person's current policy and get a computerized computerized you know statement of uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the term life with annuity and the whole life uh-huh was you know there's fairly big discrepancies discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but you know i don't know what i get out maybe twenty thousands or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i'm not worried about that i don't have anybody to to until you get your dependents it just doesn't matter yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don't want to be a burden to anybody else uh yeah right right and uh but as far as being able to really leave anything so i think yeah i mean i'm not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount and you know that's fine but uh uh you know to get that coverage and know that i'll get you know uh you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven't made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh are your family see i've i've kind of moved around from my home originally and um and my family's out in Florida now most of my family and i'm out here in Phoenix so oh but uh anyway as far as benefits um what else is important important uh obviously i think uh a profit sharing is is uh is uh is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term i've never yeah um i've my husband's company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn't and i'd really like it if my company did they turn quite a profit at times but it's not part of uh what's available so yeah smaller the the companies it's either the smaller company you you you're in to into the consulting side and they'll you'll finish up a project and you'll get the little bonus that type of thing um-hum um-hum um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing um but um most you know most medium or small probably don't do that much profit sharing and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so it didn't help any to share yeah they couldn't share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but yeah i wasn't qualified qualified for my first year something you know after yeah so so have you have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah little over three years now yeah at uh it uh quite a different world isn't it versus being life before real world life in college versus what okay did you vote in the last uh national election yes we uh uh i haven't missed a one since i've been eligible to vote oh that's good uh did you get to vote at the last one i voted in the last national one yeah i'm not sure if i got the last local one oh uh-huh yeah and sometimes the the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that uh they should be yeah and you're not sure where to go and vote and all that right and uh there's usually nobody running against you know the incumbents right or you don't know what they stand you know where they stand or anything like that right so uh but i i feel that uh a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting yeah i think you're right and it's it's they're and also they're fed up with the system and they say well why should i even vote yeah or sometimes they don't like either of the choices right for the candidates so they think well you know why vote right the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it oh i know it the last gubernatorial race was oh that was awful yeah really especially in Texas it really was yeah it was a mess but uh so i don't know i it'll be interesting to see how the next uh few years go yeah um did you think it's a serious problem that half the people don't vote or yeah i think well it's it's definitely a problem and i think it could get worse yeah you know we get this lackadaisical attitude and say huh you know why should we vote and then uh you know it could uh it could lead to some serious things yeah it also seems like maybe another another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if you know not enough people are voting um-hum right uh yeah we can get uh you know if we get someone in there like that then you know they could make all sorts of changes if they were you know had enough pull yeah it's kind of like in Louisiana where that uh guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected kind of scary when you think about that yes um-hum yeah and uh who's the other guy LaRouche uh LaRouche LaRouche uh that uh is sort of the uh socialist not socialist but communist uh he's so off the wall that uh he's gone in and tried to get into city elections and uh but he's got he's been put away for uh credit card fraud i believe oh gosh yeah Lyndon LaRouche that's it yeah and uh so yeah yeah people'll will sit home and assume oh that guy would never get elected next thing you know you've got him um-hum right if you don't go and vote then you know very good chance that they they will because a lot of the people like that yeah they'll strike a chord in something you know in some of the people that so will say well you know this guy's got everything together you know i like what he says you know it'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him right yeah and uh you know i think that's sort of what happened with Louisiana because because uh the guy did get elected correct that's what i thought yeah i think so right yeah he sure did and uh so you know it uh but you know they can always fool us you know they might do a good job yeah i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days or you could mail it in or um-hum something like if you have if you have real strict work hours and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long i think that discourages a lot of people oh yeah what we do usually is uh vote uh absenteeism uh-huh and uh i know here you know you don't have to have any reason you can just go and vote right and uh the polls are open what was it a couple of weeks uh the hours are good and it they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays uh-huh and so you we've got plenty of time to go uh because uh down here in in Houston it's uh the lines are long yeah i'm in Dallas and they're long here too so so uh but uh yeah i voted absentee one year i really was going to be gone so i i did it but uh it was nice i would be tempted to do it again uh-huh well uh i recommend it because you just walk right on in and there's usually not anybody in line right and uh you know that vote's just as good as you know the one on election day yeah i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier i think i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle um-hum yeah um i've yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the of the Republican party and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the uh how the uh uh-huh the not the ballots but uh my mind has gone blank i've been wrestling with a child all evening uh what uh how they develop uh what the candidate stands for the you know the views and uh uh-huh you know everybody gets to vote on you know well should he be for this and uh you know on and on and on and uh it's it's interesting yeah that would be i usually vote a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out what every but you know other than the major candidates what they stand for on on what issues so i just trust well the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote huh um-hum uh right and uh there for
