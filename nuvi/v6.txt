rules man Twilight Zone rules the what yeah that's all i used i used to live in the house that the guy owned are you serious yeah it was really it was really oh well it was all full with uh shelves everywhere and we didn't have enough books to fill it up but that's psychedelic but uh so what what do you like why do you like David Letterman oh he just like totally sarcastic and hilarious and i don't know i'm a lot like him in a way so so the and he's got curly hair and so do i so wait did you watch Saturday Night Live what he's got what curly hair and so do i so hey hey i got long hair wait

the uh who was on the music people wasn't that Fishbone yeah i saw that it was awesome but i didn't see the rest of it yeah no oh you missed Wayne's World Wayne's World was pretty cool are you serious they're awesome so uh let's see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV oh really because we don't want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know yeah that sucks really uh kind of annoying but that's cool what kind of annoying to like in front of TV like trying to do homework you know yeah trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like In Living Color or something i don't know well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework so it really didn't matter cool yeah BS that's the way to do it yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too cool yeah works for me so uh let's see what else like the news we don't watch because they're boring no unless i watched through the war you know there's only one yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven't i seen this episode before you know i know i guess they think that people don't watch TV but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over yeah i know it's like oh man and and in North Carolina see the the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know yeah oh it's like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they're not going to tell you you know they're going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know yeah so but uh let's see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek uh i haven't seen it in years but i used to okay well i used to hate Star Trek yeah i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it uh-huh but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind really oh really that's cool because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it's only a program and it's really great because sometimes it's like uh-huh are you serious oh man the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes sometimes it's funny sometimes it's not but uh you know it's something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football that's cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketball's cool but football kind of after a while which basketball which basketball yeah i kind of like college better it's more spirited college or well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there oh yeah we got Duke and North Carolina cool but i mean the i mean there's nothing to do like for example yesterday uh-huh uh they go some some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right uh-huh i hear no we're just you know it's like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we're watching TV and i go no today we're just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf golf yeah and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it's like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean oh me too somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes uh-huh because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it's hit yeah yeah okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play that's true yeah that's true and that's it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it's it's like that i mean it's was it's just but when i went home that's all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they're going oh my God and TV in Argentina's really bad oh really oh really so so why from Argentina why'd you come over here uh because um i wanted to go to school here oh that's cool how long did you live there yeah they have better computer science up here than they than they do down there oh so and i also uh my father works for IBM and we came up here we well we came to the United States in nineteen seventy six seventy seven uh-huh uh-huh yeah and uh we lived here for about seven years then we moved back and so then i said i'm going to move back up there to go to college huh he goes okay so he goes but do it fast so i did my undergraduate in two years yeah that's cool oh really awesome so but it's it's just you know oh well we've been talking for five minutes that's the only obligation we have that's cool groovy and uh well tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks yeah no doubt okay okay all right nice talking to you yeah you too bye-bye bye okay all right uh feelings on what caused the S and L crisis i guess i don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loan were made that appear to be a good loan but in a speculative since and with have little regulation going on because of deregulation during the Reagan eight years uh more and more S and L simply began to take riskier and riskier loans and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of of property values devalued um-hum kind of like a domino's effect right i don't have a a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome no uh scandal are you familiar with that from your histories lessons or whatever no no uh i vaguely recall but i've never gone and done any study on it since the S and L thing that teapot dome scandal is when i think during the Hoover years where gobs of land was was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it and that that appeared to be corruption within the Hoover administration i don't have a real since of of like corruption that caused S and L all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sour um-hum no i don't think it was really corruption that caused it maybe or within i think people just started you know not not being as careful with the loans that they were making whenever you you know whenever they gave them out uh-huh i think maybe they didn't check into them enough or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also so yeah yeah it it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a get rich quick is is the wrong phrase but if it captures some of the the feeling i have from the people making business decisions that if they failed it's sort of well no skin of my back i'll move on to this other company or um-hum um-hum i i just since that they didn't have a commitment to the stability of the organizations they were were making the decisions for and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move um-hum you know that it was that easy for them to find new work that they didn't weren't stuck to where they were and as the things begin to collapse they just moved on i'm not sure or whether they had extracted enough money in a percentage base such that they didn't they didn't care any more i i just i'm rather puzzled about the whole thing um-hum i know well i'm um i know a little bit about it but i don't as much as i should know about it i'm a finance major here at Clarion it okay and um i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the Savings and L made with a a hundred thousand dollars so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars and i think that's kind of why they they were making the riskier loans because they were like oh well we have a hundred thousand dollars insurance on it well they didn't they didn't have a since of risk no i don't think so oh okay and uh plus where the fact where they were allowed to make loans in any almost any type of loan and like some banks you know they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make uh-huh and i think the S and L's were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make okay and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve then i don't think this would have happened well do you think we there's a final accounting yet not in the since of pennies and nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that that they really do understand how much money it is for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of the damage uh did is your since that we now understand how bad it is um-hum or is there more to be heard yet um i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it and it wasn't making it was wasn't as good news as it was i think it's still adding you know adding up and i think it will be for awhile so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet or whether or no i don't i don't think they do i don't think how i don't think how they could find that big how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose because there still are some S and L's still open uh-huh and it's and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this to be caught in the land slide um-hum um-hum um-hum do you think to possibly is that it'll happen with the regular banks i i don't know i think i think it would be harder but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it it seems that i recall reading for the last oh let's say starting three years ago but not so much in the last year of bank risks of relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like Mexico Venezuela um-hum uh and Argentina based on oil loans and then the price of oil had had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans i have this vague since that that could happen that that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost oh yeah um in some of my classes now i was just reading i think it was in Venezuela i can't remember what company it was but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back um-hum you know and they just they just wrote it right off i think i think we've lost a lot of money and you know like we every never going to get it back it's impossible to get it back and so you think that it's just gone um-hum um-hum yeah because we're we're you know we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on getting it back they're even trying any more okay they just totally wrote it off their book do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program like my since is that was there to try to protect small investors but it ended up protecting big investors hum which i don't think what it was meant to do so i guess it i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exists for for these sorts of of problems um-hum um yeah i think is it necessary to have um the backing um it it's it's just for you know safe purposes you know in case something would happen um yeah as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to ha ve something um so your since is that the that uh the the loan guarantees which really were accounts guaranties so the so that the account holders that if something went wrong they would have their money um-hum right and given that the S and L's have had disasters then those account holders are are their money is still being protected um-hum and that is it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of um-hum of dollars being protected it it seems like um there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts uh it's if if you take ten million people and protect ten thousand dollars it still only a hundred billion billion dollars and we're taking about monies way in access of that now so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts um-hum and perhaps multiple people in multiple S and L's and and it seems like maybe that needs to be thought about rethought yeah you know that the for i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on on accounts but i feel likes it's on an individual basis someone whose got um-hum accounts in thirty five different S and L's or thirty or forty thousand dollars and they're all protected by the government seems to me like they've gotten around what was intended to be the issue there uh-huh i guess i don't have a personal sense of vulnerability on it since i was not a heavy user of any S and L's and and let alone any of them that went bankrupt um-hum and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again because that means i'm not worried enough i think it could happen yeah uh it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive and then i then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things um-hum i think it'll happen again but i think it'll be a long time in the future before it does happen again because i think like the bank people and any kind of people like that are gonna be worried about it and not to let it happen again in the near future but i think later on they're gonna start and forget about it and start making some of the riskier loans i mean you're gonna have to take some risks and as long as they're backed i think they're still gonna you know start taking on riskier loans and i think there is a chance it could happen again but not until you know late you know in the future uh-huh well perhaps if there are regulatory um constraints put back in place um-hum it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation uh do you are you on a regular regular exercise program right now yes and i hate it how about you oh well i'm kind of off and on off and on well i guess i've been kind of off and on i've um right now i'm kind of off had some health problems that have led me to uh stay more on than off okay what type of exercise do you do uh i do walking on the treadmill and then i do low impact aerobics okay i guess you don't enjoy that very much not not really you find that uh to be boring yeah yeah and time consuming i mean it's it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming it's uh you know afterwards you know then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up you know yeah well i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring i know you go through this this is something you go through like every year but i yeah i haven't decided whether you're whether i wanna play yet or not i just bought myself a solo flex machine i don't know if you've seen those advertised on TV hum-um it's one of those uh universal type machines exercise machine but i haven't really sat down and used it much yet so it's collecting dust right now yeah a lot of things do that i have a negative i had an exercise bike i used to have one and finally got rid of it because i never used it but i do use my treadmill i used to jog somewhat uh-huh well that's good yeah my parents have a treadmill it's when i go visit them uh i'll get on that thing every now and then yeah it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't you don't have any excuse um-hum no i just got the bicycle out today and it was real nice outside had to get out to do something yeah i can't ride a bike so i been sitting in here uh in the house all weekend with a cold so i thought i'd better uh better get outside and do something and not waste the day oh yeah it's too nice been too nice of a weekend but uh yeah i need to start jogging again i've always found that to be uh uh really one of the best forms of exercise but it's terribly boring and so i really don't ever keep a a program up consistently uh you had any injuries from jogging no i never have well i don't jog enough i think to develop any injuries i usually only go about a mile or two i guess what worries me about jogging is that i hear that it's very hard on your body and and that you know you can end up getting hurt worse yeah it's it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete or on asphalt supposed to be much better if you find uh grass or or uh dirt to jog on um-hum yeah that's not quite so so easy yeah yeah have to have the right type of uh shoes too that's very important i found that true especially for walking on toes or fronts but yeah i don't have to buy jogging shoes all too often mine don't get very much use well i guess mine breakdown about they say about every six months uh-huh so ah i usually enjoy the exercise i do but uh like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a a program so i'll i'll bicycle i get into that for for a little while and maybe go out and uh on a consistent basis every couple a days and ride a bike for awhile but then i'll get tired of doing that and maybe start jogging again and go out three or four nights a week but uh that gets old too in a very short order i'm i'm hoping that this uh solo flex will uh yeah uh change things a little bit i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis yeah well don't let it collect dust you least exercise while dusting it off yeah well so maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this spring i can uh start some type of uh regular program yeah that that'll be good i've always found that that when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep uh keep something going um-hum uh when i was in high school we had a choice of uh taking uh physical education courses on exercise and uh one of those involved a six week session on a universal machine lifting weights and uh working out like that oh and that was very helpful and we kept charts of our progress and uh consistently uh increased the amount of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks um-hum i found that to be uh very helpful so are you gonna do that uh i need to i haven't started yet but it's a thought well that sounds like something good to do then sounds like something i should do yeah nice way to start off the spring uh-huh get back in shape how often
