the boat or something i'd make some quick arrangements that's true and i've heard so many stories about the snakes uh-huh you know when they pull in there's a snake instead of a fish and things like that that i'm just yeah oh i don't know what's the largest fish you ever caught yeah um gosh i think it was only like three and a half pounds and for me that's big that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really really big um so because it's always been you know in the on a lake and uh i know they have bigger fish than that but you know three and a half pounds and that was huge for me on a lake yeah on a lake on a lake that's not a bad size fish yeah no that's a good size fish i i would be impressed i mean you know yeah yeah so uh but yeah i'd love to go catch catch like the Marlins or whatever in the deep sea fishing i've never done that uh-huh i've i've seen it uh and and i have no problem going out in a boat uh it's just so dreadfully expensive and there's just so many other ways you know when you live down there yeah it's not a treat um-hum it's what you do every day you know that's right that's right uh one of my favorite things was we were forever catching crab and steaming them yeah you know out on the on the beach uh-huh and you know just uh pitching them out on uh on uh what am i trying to say newspaper um-hum and and breaking them up and sitting out there and eating them and then digging a hole and pitching the whole thing in it you know and and that's it wow uh-huh yeah and uh the the other little creatures would take care of what was left that's right that's right so going out on a boat never did appeal to me simply because it you know there was so much else to do right right well do you live like along uh Houston no down there no no i live in Dallas well i meant when when you were when you were growing up i mean like Galveston i lived in Dallas oh okay but you uh we had a house in Port Aransas oh okay okay it's a little fishing village that is that's close to uh South Padre oh Corpus okay corpus well uh South Padre is on down the bend okay okay it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down it would be in that region um-hum um-hum small island yeah yeah i i've been to Port Aransas but it was when i was a child uh oh okay yes because i have relatives who live in Houston so when would go and we would go to Port Aransas or then on down to Corpus or further yeah like what your talking about because i was just wondering we went to Galveston this this summer even with all the oil spills and everything i mean i was was it bad oh it was horrible i well never ever go back i don't think uh and yeah and that that's true um oh i hate to hear that uh you know the the water was murky and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there huh-uh huh-uh no i wouldn't want to eat them you know so yeah no no no you went to Galveston uh i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water um-hum the uh what is it the Flagship yes uh-huh is it still there it sure is yeah yeah it most certainly is so uh so that it it was it was certain things that were enjoyable about it but uh i don't i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal i like that place that then because of all the oil spills that they have had and uh it always smelled the entire time we were there it was i didn't realize that had happened for some reason yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool because the water was so awful and well of course being raised on the water i'd never swim in it yeah yeah huh-uh swimming is for swimming yeah pool that's why they call them swimming pools uh-huh uh-huh that's where you swim you do not swim in the ocean no no not anymore no i've seen what comes out of the ocean and i have no desire to share any space with anything like that but really huge sharks are down there i mean uh-huh incredibly large sharks uh-huh uh some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night um-hum it was incredible the size of them that we would see on the the next morning they would have them strung up across the wow uh-huh and it you know so if strung up their tails would still hang on the bottom of the uh just wow wow yeah now i never knew they were that that big huh kind of kind of nothing i won't have anything to do with yeah yeah right well it was nice talking to you well it certainly was um maybe you can get how many have you had very many of these calls um yeah almost everyday how wonderful yeah almost almost every single day from when they started it how wonderful yeah maybe i'll be so lucky okay i enjoyed talking to you okay bye-bye bye-bye camping uh is a pretty vague term it seems to encounter or cover a lot of different kinds of of uh shall we say over night trips or sometimes not even over night uh anything from no provisions to uh going with what you can carry on a backpack uh maybe even a tent um-hum go up to state parks with six shelters and little screened in areas and then travel trailers and all the way up to conference center type campings that have uh you know air conditioning like hotels with uh uh ski boats and whatever else may be around some people uh they they still call that a camp so i guess you could go camping and do archery and riflery and all the things that kids do at those camps but then go to their little hotel air conditioning room at night right um-hum so uh i've been through most all of that i've not done much of the no provision survival type but i've done backpacking in tents and state park shelters and travel trailers and uh camping camping with nice air conditioned rooms and i guess of all the all the ones i kind of prefer the air conditioned ones and the the not so roughing ones with more entertainment than uh survival in mind huh uh one of the times that we were at a uh state park we went up into Oklahoma and went to a place called Broken Bow and rented a few canoes with a church group we were with bunch of college age kids and we took these canoes into a river that would feed it that would bring us back down toward drove up upstream and then worked our way back down toward the campsite that we were at um-hum and you just never can time those things right with the water the way you would like them to be uh we got there and the water was really low we we ended up carrying the canoes over portions and at one point even though i know your not supposed to do this i stood up in the canoe and reached my paddle up as high as i could and i could not even touch the branches that were over the the uh river part there and you could see debris in those branches where the water had just been a couple of weeks prior um-hum huh so it was you know ten or so feet uh higher just a few weeks ago in fact uh a few weeks prior to when we got there and the camp the people at the campgrounds told us that uh asked where we were from and we said Dallas and they said oh well we had a girl die just two weeks ago in that rage of water huh well that's encouraging but they said oh you have nothing to worry about you'll have the opposite problem you may die of carrying your canoe and sure enough it uh it was a little bit laborious instead of a a six to eight hours worth of canoeing we ended up only surviving about uh half the trip and it took us us about ten hours so we we got in our car half way and and went and got the rest of the vehicles and brought them up stream and loaded it all back up and went back to the campsite exhausted but uh i have had better camping canoeing trips uh as it were uh like the Guadalupe down in South Texas it's got some real nice uh um-hum canoeing uh water in it have you been camping much um-hum i mostly do uh back packing uh as opposed to any of the other sorts um-hum um though i guess a bread and breakfast or something might be a suggestion for you if you like the air condition type that's true uh-huh the uh yeah i've done things uh i guess mostly upstate Michigan the Adirondacks White Mountains um Appalachian Trail kinds of things uh i prefer going out either with one other person or by myself for about a week and i guess i just look at it as i time i can get away from it all and hum kind of rely on my own resources a bit although i guess i haven't gone survival camping where i scrape together all my food i've always carried it with me but uh um-hum still it's you know nice to get away from civilization every once in a while and yeah enjoy the wildlife i wonder if uh being from uh Dallas area i i wonder if if it's just this area that's doesn't encourage that type of camping i i seems like back packing goes well with mountain and sceneries sceneries worth seeing by foot where as here your looking as you know you can go two hundred miles and your probably in the same kind of environment you were in when you left so um-hum huh uh unless you go over toward East Texas where there's a considerable considerable amount of woods or if you go uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a um-hum a either a lake that you'd go canoeing or skiing or whatever kind of sailing boating you want to do uh um-hum but there's not a whole lot of trails built in a lot of state parks there are in more of the the eastern part of the state where there's woods worth worth seeing but uh that's interesting i hadn't um-hum all the people that i know that do back packing usually go up to Colorado or go up somewhere and you know get away from the state to actually do that kind of uh camping um-hum yeah i end up well yeah i mean i do a lot of like even weekender kind of things i go out for just one or two nights uh it's not my favorite thing but i can do it a lot more often so like over at the uh particularly in the uh the fall and spring when the insects haven't come out yet uh where they're already gone uh you know i spend almost every weekend up in the mountains and i guess i live about five hours away from some place to go hiking where i am now that's not too bad um pardon me that's not too bad at all no no it's not bad and uh yeah i mean if it's if you can find somebody who's uh you know willing to go out for several days you know and can handle that sort of thing uh which isn't everybody you run across obviously who's willing to um-hum you know put seventy or ninety pounds on their back and go hiking uh but uh it can be a lot of fun yeah and uh i there's certainly other people who go out uh canoeing i mean there's usually lots and lots of ponds particularly uh for canoeing and you know there are places you can drive in and park and they've got the usual kinds of campgrounds and stuff but uh you can also just you know bushwack or go on semi trailed areas and just get three days from any place that's civilization huh and that's kind of fun yeah that would be one of my very first experiences of uh tent camping if it were with a group of people we went up to a state park that was um-hum oh the campsites were uh not perfect but they were you know basic rail road ties and laid in sand so it wasn't just the actual terrain and it had a somewhat level and it had a place to stick your tent and some um-hum um-hum you could uh drive a stake in fairly easy and and get the thing nailed down but that's usually a little windy on a lake edge and uh the very first time we went up there with this group of people we all set up these tents most of which were borrowed and we were having to figure out you know how this particular one works and how this one works and it's eleven o'clock at night and it's you know by the head lights of the cars and um-hum and about uh oh a little after midnight we got all these tents set up and i laid down inside one of them and was just about asleep when a little voice from outside the tent said uh asked if i was doing all right and i said huh yeah yeah doing doing just fine you know it's a little windy but i'm doing all right and and they suggested that i come out that mine was the only tent that hadn't fallen down yet and sure enough after i got out of there a little bit it blew down and the winds were just terrible and uh then it started to rain so we didn't get too wet but uh it rained just for a little bit then went on and so after all that was over we put them all back up and woke up a little late the next morning but uh when we finally got back from that that outing one of the uh parents of one of the kids had asked how it went and said that he was listening to the the radio and they clocked a ninety sev en mile an hour winds on the dam right in front of that lake and there's really nothing to stop it it's uh thirty or forty miles wide it's a huge uh oh boy lake right on the border of Texas and Oklahoma there and and it had a the little little part that we were on was the peninsula with no trees so we were just stuck out in the water with uh nothing blocking us from this wind it's a wonder we didn't lose a lot more than that but uh i'm sure that was just huh um-hum the top speed of the wind but it it did manage to take all our tents out yeah it's funny when you talk about you know this it sort of reminds me that every time i'm telling somebody about like a camping trip and i've i've done quite a few say with my sister is the stuff that you remember isn't you know really so much the uh the normal everyday you know oh this is a nice scene or something like this it's it's remember when are we had to put up the tent on the side of the hill and we kept sliding down to the bottom of the tent or you know when the tent's blowing down or when you wake up in the middle of the night and there's a hurricane and you know it's yeah yeah we can laugh about it i mean your not laughing about it then too much i mean you know afterwards it's it's it's kind of a nice memory to think gee i survived that we'll always need the uh feather bed as it were yeah that's for sure yep that's true on that same lake there's another portion of it that's uh real uh carved out the the the shoreline shoreline is uh up against rock and it's it's pretty far cliff i'd say shirt or forty feet worth and the campsites are up top and then you go down and there's a little path where the little rail road ties again will try to stop the erosion on the path and little stair steps all the way down to this beach um-hum and that was uh a that particular campout okay i guess that's it uh yep i was just thinking about what movies i've seen lately mostly uh we go to uh the second or third run movies i guess what the ones that we call the dollar used to call the dollar movies yeah uh so we see uh the ones that have been out for a while i was trying to think what the last movie that we went to see was probably Russia House with uh Sean Connery and uh yeah yeah sure found it quite enjoyable myself uh uh had also seen the Hunt For Red October you know with him in that and um-hum God i don't have to say kind of caught me off i'm more of a looks good in the paper commercials look great on TV um um-hum uh i did see Red October yeah uh this is going to be i've seen a lot of video lot of lot of video VCR stuff um yeah man oh man i have to say uh Chevy Chase uh Christmas you know the Vacation Christmas yeah thing was one here recently we saw at Christmas time um God i haven't been in a movie since maybe Superman Batman maybe Batman might have been one yeah well that's yeah yeah well well i didn't even see Batman so that's uh that's pretty good so it's been or no let's see uh Dick Tracy i did we did see Dick Tracy so that's i haven't seen any of that stuff really yeah so uh so you so then you're not a uh uh not a frequent movie goer either well i love it we uh got a new baby in the house and and and she just turned a year old so it just kind of put the clamp on things um oh yeah yeah so so you watch a lot of videos yeah then uh stop by and get them at you know for ninety nine cents and bring them home but yeah that's right what uh what do you find uh that you're looking at most in those uh the i mean are they are they the comedies and uh that kind of stuff comedies and the PG's and the no skin uh um-hum we're uh know like we saw Sally and uh well Billy Crystals in it we saw that one and which was video that's that's probably the last movie i went to see yeah that's probably the last one yeah yeah uh-huh yeah we we saw that one uh we find that uh that uh if you can get into those dollar movies you know they're uh they're a dollar and a half what is it dollar and a quarter dollar and a half now quarter Promenade yeah and uh at the Promenade yeah and uh you know we we find those pretty good they're not uh it's not so far you know from when they were first run that you don't enjoy them sure occasionally you'll find one that's you know some of the friends will be talking about them that you wished that you'd seen them so you could talk about them sooner but uh i mean fifteen bucks to go see a movie with two with a couple's a little ridiculous yeah that's that's a little bit too much so yeah and some of them that turned to flops we saw other other other night we saw um Lady in Red but um-hum okay which is not that old but you know it was bounced around the VCR cabinet there and um yeah yeah but yeah we i used to really you know i'd just pick up the paper and we'd go see a couple you know three or four movies a month but no we haven't i haven't been to a movie in it's been four or five months uh-huh yeah but uh yeah we we find even uh you know even looking at the dollar movies which are you'd think those are the ones that uh are coming back around because they were good the first time um-hum and we don't find a lot of those uh you know they'll be running uh four to six of those on a weekend um-hum and you know two weekends three weekends out of four maybe two or three two out of three or three out of four there won't be anything that we want to go see um-hum and uh so then when something comes up they'll usually stay on a while so we we still get a chance to see you know one of them that we want to see but uh we saw Avalon and uh i think we went in to see Avalon because we couldn't get in to maybe we wanted to go see Ghost and couldn't get into Ghost because the line you know they sold out um-hum um-hum um-hum we went to see Avalon and uh i really was not that impressed with Avalon it uh really you know it's uh it's one of these uh more i don't know melodramatic and and i don't know uh not satirical wasn't funny at all but it was kind of drab i don't know had a had a lot of hidden meanings in it i suppose but uh you know ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure yeah and uh right but uh i really enjoy uh the espionage type of movies the the uh um-hum The Hunt For Red October and Russia House i had read uh the Russia House book before so i i i thought it was a real good movie um is it a good movie great i enjoyed the book quite a bit too so that's that made it made it more interesting to me let's see uh a lot of it the dialogue was uh a little difficult to understand because uh Michelle Pfeiffer had a was speaking with her Russian accent you know the the actress Russian accent so um-hum it was part of that was a little hard to understand probably overcompensated a little bit right and uh so you if you knew what was going on you could kind of anticipate what was going to be said so i i had a little bit advantage there over my wife she had not read the book um-hum but uh and well i think the now it's all coming back to me what was the one not The Deep but The Abyss um yeah the last year i think yeah we didn't see that one i'm not uh i don't see don't go see too many in well i would but my wife doesn't like the the uh the science fiction semi horror type stuff you know um-hum things that uh get you on the edge of your seat a little too much for her yeah i'm not much of a Rotocop man Robocop you know myself yeah this one it wasn't heavy hi-sci you know hi-fi because it was a lot of it was actual stuff that takes place and they had of course the breathing apparatus which was liquid and and then all
