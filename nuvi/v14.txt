release uh that's came out around the first of the year okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but i didn't know they had a four eighty six just yet it does a few more things uh uh-huh than had been available before yeah but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation sure because you no longer can think that fast anyway yeah well okay i enjoyed our discussion i did too and you have a good day you do the same bye-bye bye all right now we used to be big time campers but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports uh-huh what type of camping did you do well when we before we had kids we was in a motorcycle group you know we we went like twenty or thirty at a time we took uh just our little tents uh-huh uh-huh and we did it that way then when we started having children we bought a camper you know and we did it that way oh uh-huh oh how neat so we've always enjoyed camping uh-huh well i know i have um i just have a tent and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent and then i bought a van and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable uh-huh yes yes now we have friends with a van and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van you know uh-huh right like one night and the next night they'll stay at the motel you know or something like that and they enjoy it yeah uh-huh yes i don't i don't think i'm a real true trooper you know when it comes to camping all the bugs and stuff but i i try oh yeah oh me either i hate to be on any that stuff but but i try you know to uh to get out there and enjoy everything but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends and he got poison ivy oh yeah oh and it's all over him the poor thing you know so there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at yes yes oh shoot oh but now i enjoy it every once in a while i mean it's not something i'd want to do real often i'm a sissy i either want to do it in the fall or spring you know uh-huh yeah right right definitely when it's cool well have you done much camping around Texas yes well not really because usually it's when we go off you know like for a couple weeks or so it's usually like that uh-huh uh-huh yeah well have you camped all over the United States just about wow see now i haven't so that i bet you that's an experience there just about oh it really is it really is also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family uh-huh uh-huh right right it's a lot easier then well i know my parents like to camp a lot and they uh they've been going to Gulf Shores Alabama oh uh-huh and uh which is really really neat they said they've got the white beaches and the sand and it's not real populated so they can they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean and uh from what i understand from them it's really really pretty there yes uh-huh oh i'd like to go anywhere you know i just like to go uh-huh uh-huh i really do well have you done much camping up in Kentucky and and those parts in the mountains no not really not that much um we've been well we've been to Wyoming you know and Kentucky and Montana and you know places like that but usually if we're with a group of people we really don't stay any one place very long uh-huh you know like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on right right but now that we have children and we go every blue moon i'd rather just go to Galveston yeah oh yeah yeah yeah rent a beach house or something yeah that's that's my idea of camping you know yes yes yes but we're uh we're getting more into it and we've done uh we've done quite a bit and uh uh the kids like to go out you know as often as they can um so that's good you know they're they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping uh-huh uh-huh it is my children really enjoys it they really do but by the time we really get a chance to it's July you know and it's so hot right uh-huh uh-huh and our camper does doesn't have an air conditioner oh yeah yeah it's one of those pop-ups i'm sure you could put one in probably but we hadn't did that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah well that's really neat yes we all enjoy camping and they're you know they're in like R As and scouts and stuff like that you know so they get to go camping in those organizations also well uh-huh uh-huh at least their daddy goes with them i don't when they do that but yeah yeah oh that's neat that's really neat that really is well how old is your boys your children well i well i have um a son that's uh going to be eleven here pretty soon and then a daughter that's thirteen uh-huh so they're they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and cooking and and all that kind of stuff too oh yes yeah yes and that's that's really neat it really is mine's eleven and eight uh-huh so they really enjoy it too yeah yeah yeah i i agree with you they like to get out there and but this wasn't so fun this last time for Nathan to to get out there and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy and it got all into his eye and it was really swollen and uh so they had to give him shots and everything so oh well maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular yeah yeah yes yes trees or what bushes whatever they are oh but i have uh brother-in-law and a sister you know that just really just camp you know they love to go camping they could they would all the time they wanted you know wanted to because there's nothing holding them back but i'm just not that involved in it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh no now i like to go out like several times a year but not on a on the regular basis i have some friends who go out every single weekend when you know in the season uh and and i just couldn't do that you know yeah oh uh-huh me i haven't really as far as entertainment i don't know what you would do if yeah yeah you know but i guess my entertainment's television i guess just getting away yeah right right see i see they just want to get away uh-huh but every Friday night they'll go home you know straight from work and they'll pack up and you know and then they'll leave and i'm just going you know by Friday night i just want to crash you know and i want to go home and you know do all that and then uh get out on the road to boot so oh i don't either uh-huh but anyway that's their life yes but they probably live in a city also don't they yeah yeah that's true well see we're in a real small county area and you know that makes a big difference uh-huh now that's true that's true because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles you know yeah that's true that makes a difference well it was nice talking with you okay it was nice talking to you too and we'll probably be talking to you again okay okay bye-bye okay well take care bye-bye where do you live uh in the Houston area uh-huh well i used to i lived there for a long time but i'm now in Palo Alto California which is i think the recycling capital of the world oh that's great so we have many recycling activities and i'm in in full uh support of all of them oh we are too our community is uh just starting to get organized about it they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our our things and dump them off ourselves um-hum and uh well that's something but it it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better um cooperation out here uh by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra uh actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too but the uh garbage men uh-huh come by uh on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb i think that's great there's a few places in Houston where they're trying that out i don't know if it's the if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded uh bags and uh bins yeah we have burlap sacks and they give us one for aluminum and oh uh steel one for metals uh-huh and one for glass and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every Thursday and the garbage men come by and uh collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape oh that's great and the it really pays for itself because oh then the city gets the money from the recycling uh-huh yeah we're we're all for it our um we've got several bins in our on in our garage where we uh you know sort things out and and take it to to the appropriate places yeah the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines but they claim that because of the way they're bound they uh it's too expensive to recycle them at my office we have yes two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail and they're uh one's for white paper and one's for colored paper so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or um-hum things like that goes in those boxes but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines and there's no way to get rid of them it just seems like such a waste oh it does it does but i'm sure that they can uh find some sort of uh use for them if you know you know there i've seen talk about uh using garbage for uh energy um-hum and so you know you could also apply the magazines toward that well that would be a help i wish they would do that here we have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade and it's really going to be yes a mess when we have to start hunting for places to put the things oh i know it we did have uh another novel uh experiment start this year now we can put all our yard clippings out you can you buy these super giant heavy duty paper bags they're about four feet high oh uh-huh and you get them for i think it's about fifty cents a piece at the grocery store um you usually buy them by the dozen um-hum and then you put all your lard yard clippings and uh leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible oh uh-huh and those and the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays oh that's great and then the uh they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing and at the end of every year uh they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flowerbeds right well that's a great idea i wish we were that uh involved in uh or that our city was so involved in that involved in recycling yeah like that because you know i've talked to many people and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it uh if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience i think most people would yeah oh yeah you know and i don't mind you know at first it was the the little extra money that you got you know returning the cans in and stuff like that but now you know i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled you know that we don't get reimbursed right no i think it's it's to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up uh-huh than to get that two cents when you take it to the store we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans oh i oh i know it um-hum for cash but so few people uh have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there than you get back right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags we have i know of one that the one that we use uh has uh recycling for the bags uh-huh and uh and they're promoting the cloth bags you know the reuse reusable cloth bags yeah well we can get a nickel a piece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused oh that's great they just take it off like they do a coupon they just subtract it from your bill oh and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags and they say you know as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop uh-huh yes here they don't want your rotted tomatoes but they want any clean and dry plastic bag so i keep and the thing is i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle so right outside the back door i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles uh-huh and there right outside the that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags i understand uh my husband about once a weekend he'll go uh to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out oh yeah and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that he he well how nice that's great and uh it's so you know he we have all our piles of of recyclables also um-hum i remember at Christmas the the only thing that i'm when you were talking about the composting the only thing that our city did that was they did uh provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees um-hum uh to for them to mulch yeah for for city use and well that's they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular uh compost uh-huh pickup so they did say that you had to put it out within i think it was uh three weeks after Christmas and uh-huh right uh otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse it would have to be cut into four foot lengths so you know if we have branches or something they have to be cut in four foot lengths but otherwise uh they have to be in one of their paper bags uh-huh well that sounds like you all really have a a great system worked out there and they even picked up our uh styrofoam plastic packing materials they brought uh the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody's front doorknob with a little note on it saying we're trying something new next week only uh-huh if you have any uh of those little uh styrofoam peanuts that uh-huh any of your Christmas presents were packed in put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling and we'll uh take all of those back and try to recycle them right well see that's one but i that's not going to be a regular feature that was just a one time thing right after Christmas well the but uh something need does need to be done about the styrofoam well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills that uh oh yeah i mean they don't uh uh they don't mash they don't compress at all and they stay forever no right and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and uh they're recycling them into other plastics um-hum and the styrofoam also into insulation and things like that and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines yeah i do too the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile it they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff right uh because otherwise uh you know they're not going to go house to house collecting it and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts um-hum right oh i was thinking about you know like the uh the styrofoam used at uh the fast-food restaurants yeah that if everybody uh and so yeah i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam but uh now we quit that about two years ago no three years ago when we got China mugs for everybody um so and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a five year drought and so i it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or uh China cups to use up our water but at the moment we're using the China cups and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year and then uh you're supposed to keep it recycled every day well that's good that's uh yeah they should last a while well let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get uh better reuse of things because i believe we are i i do believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening yep and so it'll it'll be good in the long run well i enjoyed it it sure will well good to talk to so what kind of benefits do do you have in your job that you think is uh very important health care health care like dental number one dental and medical yes yes i'm fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance uh-huh and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance right so i was really fortunate i really was so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight right i hear that's like one of the major uh the major costs to companies to corporations nowadays it is very much so it's a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesn't apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they're having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co-payments are going up um-hum right and i'm concerned that's just you know the beginning of it see the problem i have with it is that i don't have a job oh yeah so i don't have and i'm still in in school i'm still in college that's a problem too yeah um-hum right and so i don't i don't know firsthand of these benefits um-hum right but i i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don't know about dental i mean oh i dental is is kind of like uh you know you're asking for uh too much um-hum to for me i think it's like uh you know uh you're you're expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they'll pay you for it but um-hum um-hum to actually have you know big coverage for something like that um-hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it's it's good it's certainly better than nothing it's not you know it's not super you for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don't have it you know i do have some dental problems and it's very very expensive right i'm only twenty one and if your blessed with you know good dental uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i've had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up um-hum you know we didn't know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then right exactly yeah so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part um-hum but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them as health right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible oh gosh that's that's the general you know you you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately i have two children and they're both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don't i don't have medical you know expenses for them per say uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uh-huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you're going to use it now we that's right that's right and also we i say we uh i'm retired from Texas Instruments and they're just they're like most everybody else you can't just you don't drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there's only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go but there's only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount right if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn't make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go right so also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions uh-huh to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective too expensive more expensive for them to do that
