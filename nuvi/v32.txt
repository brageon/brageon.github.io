have to thing yeah i yeah and uh she put him in but he wasn't there very long before he died but uh-huh um i guess um the one time that i saw him there you know as far as the surroundings that seemed okay uh-huh but um we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of you know keep him real out of it all the time and that's always kind of bothered me yeah uh-huh yeah well i kind of think that's true too i guess because it's so under staffed you know um-hum that's like everything else though i have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home but i've never actually been there and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow you know a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about uh-huh yeah yes but yeah but still i'm sure there are you know aspects to it that aren't really desirable yeah yeah i know because i've always well my sister's involved in one also and i really think they really do a wonderful job but still there's those little things that happens you know there really is which i think it's a wonderful place you know if it comes to that yeah you know if you just can't take care of them any more well sometimes you don't have any other alternative after all family and friends are usually well family's tied up with uh-huh that's it yeah uh-huh their own lives and things and usually working and other things yeah yeah yeah but i think when the time comes i i hope to have the time to really look around you know and pick one that i really think my mother would be happy at it's hard to yes um-hum i think that's important too in fact there's a not just i do too outside's awful deceiving sometimes yes you know there's one uh close to where my mother is but in order to get in you have to be able to um walk in on your own in other words you can't be in you know too bad a shape to start out with but then if you deteriorate um yeah yeah they have a separate section for those who need care you know all the time cares yeah yeah but it's always well and they have a long waiting list too so there's always this feeling of well golly gee you know you've got to be able to walk in the door so you can't wait until you're too bad off off yeah but then you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like uh you have to give up your automobile or whatever to oh um-hum and everything you worked for so hard for all your life yeah yeah and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things then you feel like well gee i'm you know i'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment uh-huh uh-huh so it's kind of a that's a hard one but it is a very nice nursing home now there is some really nice ones there's also you know some private ones you know um-hum but of course i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that you know that's way out of my reach yeah that's the problem the expense of it all is and uh what i another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care uh-huh the very same yeah yeah you know so i don't like that aspect yeah but i there's i think there's ways around it though that you know like they could put it in one of their children's names or something yeah you know but still a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that you know it's their money this is that's right you know that's how i feel about it anyway well yeah i've talked to my mother about that several times lately and i i said i want you to have control of your own business yes yeah but you know what if yeah my mother's seventy now so naturally she's retired but she's still on her own i mean you know yeah yeah my mother's uh seventy five and still has her own home and everything yeah i think that's wonderful i really do just as long as they can and then on the other hand i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know yeah that's true they have a lot of people around to do things with some of those places have wonderful activities and things uh-huh they're not lonely you know lots of stuff going on and they'll take them places and oh yes uh-huh yeah so i don't know it's not all bad but i guess once you get ill then you know you really no have some problems if you can't get around and do things around yeah but i really don't know what the other solution would be you know i really don't no But no when the time comes i'm really hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents um-hum really do because i have been raised in one you know so there's lot of things i know to look for yeah and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work either you know i really don't it really would yes yeah that might be kind of tough huh yes and like like i said my sister's still in it and i really don't think my mother want to be there either oh well it's been nice talking to you and i guess we'd better get back to work huh all right bye-bye well you too okay bye well do you exercise regularly Judy um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles um-hum and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday uh very good upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern Virginia um-hum or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don't do that regularly but Washington's a great place to do that uh-huh yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he he's done the whole C and O canal i think it's a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts um-hum and so uh but that that somehow takes organization for me it's much easier just the stationary bike you know it's at home i can i can do some of my reading right um but do you live in the District no i live in Maryland uh-huh because i think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk right right and that's it um at work we have a a nice campus so i'm able to um take advantage of of the environment here um um-hum the neighborhood also i mean we're within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it well it's uh it's really both i'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i don't but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't wanna is also worth something um-hum right i think pretty much you've summed up my my my motivations also and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising like i'll be really tired and i'll start swimming and i'll actually and i'll actually get energy and i'll be have much more energy when i'm done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim oh well that's great that's great that's really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God i'm ready for bed um-hum and you exercise and then it's sort of it's painful for a while but by the time you get done you're feeling really terrific right and actually in in summer i like to swim we don't have facilities for swimming in winter but um and and that's true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i'm much much more awake i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening yeah yeah so so are can i just ask you are you Canadian no i'm not Philadelphia no i'm trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that's probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out oh really no i don't know that but i i must say that um did you know that when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent hm and it's probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and at and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i've been abroad a lot so hm i see it's a mixture i know this isn't on our topic but where did you grow up in California in Santa Barbara oh okay because i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that oh i see um-hum well very good and i think we've probably know know each other's exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you yes well same here thanks for calling bye oh okay bye bye okay you want to go first well uh topic being the banking crisis uh that's a real hot topic real real mess i guess you must say yeah sure is yeah it is of course you you've you've had your fair share of that down your way too oh yeah think uh probably i guess it's pretty well wide spread nation wide but i think Texas probably uh suffered and or caused the uh the major or a good portion of it no argument here yeah i i think that uh now i'm i'm no financial expert but from what i've read and heard that makes two of us yeah i think there were some regulations on loans that were lifted that allowed savings and loans to make uh riskier uh investments and of course uh oil was uh one of the main things that were invested in oil and real estate and of course when oil when oil went south real estate went with it people were speculating in the future that without anything to fall back on when prices on both of those went went uh down yeah i understood that shaky uh real estate loans was probably the the major culprit um with the oil crisis well also in investments investments in oil ventures as well because it was predicted predicated on uh a certain price per barrel right to recover the costs of the loan and when oil went from thirty dollars a barrel to twelve dollars a barrel then that just wasn't any way to break even yeah i guess that was the immediate cause yeah uh shoot i don't uh i tell you one thing as far as the way they're handling it i uh i feel pretty strongly about this and that's i think they're over reacting as far as the the uh actions taken against their the little guy the depositor the customers yeah yeah i think they uh they went way to far the other way in the spectrum and on the other hand i don't yep know whether they're doing enough in the way of uh you know redressing the situation and bringing the uh the real you know the the presidents of the banks and those people that are uh really responsible to uh to justice on that didn't didn't they just uh put another another thirty billion dollar Band-Aid on the problem last week or something uh i'm not sure i didn't President approved some more money to bail them out yeah it's going to be uh it's uh your and my money that's doing that you know that's unfortunately well that's true of course it just adds to the to the annual deficit which adds to the overall debt of the nation and uh at some point in time yeah it's either going to be repaid or just completely blown off i'm not sure which which one is which i i really think our whole financial institution is a house of cards waiting to collapse yeah well i guess the hope is that uh they can find some way to muddle through and the economy recover enough to uh to help uh get them out of it yeah now i i'm a staunch Republican but uh you know for the last nine years i've heard that that we would grow our way out of uh out of debt and after the longest sustained economic recovery in in i don't know how many decades it didn't happen and uh i don't know what it's what it's going to take to turn that around that's a good point they uh they got a little uh a little hesitation in the recovery here and uh hopefully they'll rebound from that in a fairly short period of time yeah i think ending the the Gulf War quickly was beneficial uh-huh definitely uh let's see what were some of the other other points she mentioned topic wise uh do we think enough is being done to address it i i i guess it had some blue ribbon panels look into it i don't i don't remember exactly what their findings and recommendations were it seems to me like they really haven't uh at least they haven't if they're doing anything it's still pretty much uh uh not out in the open it's uh you know behind the scenes kind of uh right right sure panels or whatever you know committees or investigations nothing uh nothing that makes headlines that much has been done really i don't think that's true although of course the last six months the headlines have been pretty well dominated by the Persian Gulf yeah maybe now uh that we're putting that behind us that we'll be able to to address this in more depth does tend to uh push that out of the front page sure well hey it's been real good talking with you yeah this will be a first i uh usually end up getting uh told i got three seconds to wrap it up or five seconds or something like that oh uh do they come on does something body come on the line and tell you to do that yeah i think uh one time it was i think ten minutes was the maximum and another time it was uh ended by uh oh what's what's the its capacity was short that day or something yeah what's the minimum is that like three minutes i don't think there is a i don't know if there is a minimum oh okay so i'm uh satisfied we covered the topic on this end i i think so too nice talking with you you bet bye-bye bye-bye so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we well i think we need to do more i i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up um-hum but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet so yeah yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot uh-huh but there's still a lot more we can do you know i don't recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a yeah like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those uh-huh uh-huh because we don't always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it yeah well i don't i don't get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so yeah but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every you know every Monday or every other Monday and yeah have them pick that up but that's the extent of what i've done i'd like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it's not always convenient to do it yeah see and yeah see and here in Lubbock everything's so close i can imagine what it's like up there yeah i'm not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it's just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them yeah yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall uh-huh and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and it's just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket uh-huh do those can crushers work good yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and it's actually metal uh-huh it's not plastic i didn't want to buy a plastic one yeah because those things i think would just snap you know yeah but Payless Cashways has them and they're metal and i don't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad oh so i'd have to check into something like that because i mean we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um yeah you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that don't they yeah i don't yeah i don't think it would crush steel cans it's pretty tough yeah so i don't know i don't think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but no you could probably just you know i need to look into it more you know it's you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper you know they won't take paper that's shiny yeah they won't yeah they won't take any lint free paper or see i work at TI yeah so does my husband yeah and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that's just now come on board uh-huh uh-huh you know we've been throwing paper out there away for years and we're just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know uh-huh yeah i don't know what you know i haven't i'm sure they're probably doing that here some yeah i'm sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide i'm sure uh-huh i think it's necessary i i like it you know it makes i think it's good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they're now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and oh yeah and i've bought you know i've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they're just fine yeah yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work it's his birthday we're pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag uh-huh and it's just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it's just a paper bag uh-huh you know and it's really cute yeah but i think we're doing better and better all the time i still don't yeah i think we're getting becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more so no there's not going to be any room shortly no no you know i don't know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere yeah so but i think we're getting better at it i think there's quite a bit more we could do yeah yeah girls put that away now but you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth but yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient convenient to do you know yeah seems like you're so busy anyway and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about so yeah it sure is i think if you know the cities locally you know they'd get more programs going so that you could do that it'd make it a lot easier so yeah yeah well they'll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans yeah you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they'll save them for us there's no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don't want a can a garage full of cans uh-huh that's right that's right who does that you know people don't have room for that kind of stuff you know no they're just not they're not prepared for it no and in Texas they're just get things like that they just get bugs in them so yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that's for sure so you don't that's right so so i'm pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the you know pick it up so yeah yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans uh-huh s o yeah well i need to get better get better at it so well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know yeah that's right that's right if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then that's true we'll get there that's right well thank you for talking to me yeah well thank you for calling i sure no problem okay take care all righty bye-bye bye-bye
