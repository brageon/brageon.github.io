a while that would that works we've uh but that i i know i have uh i'll stick to uh to uh you know sometimes i'll stick to a certain party depends on the guy uh-huh but uh if it uh gets down between two then i'll i'll vote for the party if i know you know something about the other guy or you know they're both just as bad then i'll say well yeah i know what this guy stands for as far as for his party and um but yeah you know that's not uh the best way but no i guess it'd be best if you knew what each person and what they stood for and why and everything but right right but it gets to the point where i mean you've got to have the time find the time also to read read about the guy and and be able to find the information about what he stands for right and try to determine if what you read was objective or not and right or what you've heard on TV which i think is just outrageous i i don't agree with how the uh media handles elections yeah yeah i you know i'm i'm tired of hearing about the polls you know you know this is how he stands such and such a day yeah they break it out it's just it's just ridiculous yeah i think it could affect the outcome you know could make it unfair um-hum it really could and uh uh then how sometimes how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an an issue into the ground which is good and dead and they keep dragging it on and it could hamper the uh outcome of an election for the guy that should have won oh yeah yeah so uh yeah the press has a lot of power they really do i i sometimes think that that should be limited more yeah oh but boy you try get into that you'd really open a can of worms oh yes or they uh you know i i agree with the freedom of of the press and that's you know all the amendments but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things yeah seems like they should regulate themselves a little bit and i don't think they ever care to no they don't well i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting and well i enjoyed talking to you to talk about well it was good talking to you um bye all right thank you bye-bye okay well budgeting is a sore subject in this family yeah me too i know exactly what you mean we've actually uh uh tried uh budgeting is very important to us we we try it every month and um i think it's good i mean it it gives us a sense of uh uh of of staying in some semblance of control but uh we we do have uh we never seem to be able to stick with it no it's really hard to do that i mean it's i don't know i guess um we do kind of have a budget um but it's kind of funny what we what we do i guess is we try to proportion uh who pays what according to the salary that we make uh do you not understand what i'm saying we we pay a percentage no um which is kind of strange a lot of people don't do that but hey we find that it works you know now i'm sorry what is what is this again well okay um like i pay a certain percentage of my pay check to the bills and he pays a certain percentage of his paycheck do you understand okay i guess i didn't really explain that too well oh okay oh i see oh sure yeah okay yeah yeah that makes perfect sense yeah well yeah uh we ours is actually very detailed um we we've got categories for everything and uh we we figure out how much income the both of us are going to have in a month and we take every penny of that and we allocate it under all these different categories unfortunately there's a big category called miscellaneous oh that one gets used up quick is that it and uh miscellaneous that's the one that kills us every time miscellaneous is never what we figure it's going to be it's never what it was last month and uh and uh you know it's it's the one that's always the killer that's um but i uh you know it's uh in fact when uh we pay our check when we when we you know write our checks we even categorize our payments and i mean we even get into that kind of detail um so so oh wow that's really that is pretty detailed so we i mean we do uh when you know whenever we go through the process of paying the bills we know exactly what category we're paying it for and uh we have a pretty good sense of where our money's going we don't have any control over it but we have a real good sense of where it's going well but you know that's good too because i've been in the situation in the past where i didn't know where my money was going and that yeah that's hard to you know you can't keep up with it and it really gets you in trouble you know and yeah well we're we're at a point where we're trying to accomplish a lot of things right now and uh like my wife's going back to school and i'm going to school and we're our kid we've got the kids who are at the stage where they need to take piano lessons and and uh you know play baseball and and do all those fun things oh yeah and uh i think i think we'd be totally bankrupt if we didn't do something um and and what we've proven to ourselves what we prove to ourselves every month is that we're spending more than than we make so it's it's kind of depressing to see it in black and white but uh yeah yeah that's easy to do it's very easy to do and it's i don't it do you find it easier to i mean do with a budget do you feel like you're you do i mean i know you said you have better control but right do you feel like you're really saving anything i mean um well no i i i think um i i i don't think we're saving anything i i think what we're doing is we're we're we're making it possible to to well and the fact what it is is it's making it possible to live beyond our means um because oh well that's you know what if we didn't track it we'd we'd totally blow it i think is what it would end up um um so you know we we do know that we can tell when we're getting to the point where we've just got to uh hold back on something uh we can we can see a cash flow that says this you know we can't do this right now because the money's just not there we we we're going to have to put it off for a week or a month or whatever the case so so yeah it you know it's um um-hum we uh you know we're not going to get this budget isn't going to make us rich but it is going to prevent us from going into poverty uh but yeah which is easy to do yeah uh-huh but we look at it sort of as an investment in the future too you know i'm going back to school my wife's going back to school too our lifestyle right now is meant to position ourselves so financial the these financial problems won't be problems uh in the future and uh so yeah we've that's that's the we're look we look it as as yeah we're living like this now but it's a short term investment for for a better lifestyle later on right well that's good i know what you mean about the school because that's what i'm trying to do also and we're trying to build it enough so that i can go to school full time because right now i'm going to school part time yeah right we're going we're going through the exact same thing yeah so you know trying to budget is again you know at this point we're trying to budget enough so we can yeah save more um you know so i can go to school full time sure you know it's it's not easy to do but and no i i don't know that we'd ever be able to get to that point but uh um but it's something to work for oh oh it definitely is and i tell you what if you work hard enough it'll happen because because i can we can see it you know i think it's going to be a couple of years before i can do that yeah yeah sure that's i think we're in probably in the same position but you know but at least i can see a little bit of the light just from you know doing this you know budgeting and stuff it really helps yeah right right yeah but yeah um and and and it also makes it possible you i think before we did any kind of budgeting we we were in a constant state of saying we can't afford anything right you know we can't do anything we can't afford anything and now we can at least say well we can fit this in it doesn't really work very well but we can fit this expense in and so by being a little organized we can we can allow ourselves some things that we couldn't before yeah it really makes a world of difference doesn't it yeah it really does i know i've been in like i said the same situation you know where i've i've been in a situation where i didn't budget anything just spent money and spent money and spent money and it doesn't work it doesn't it really doesn't uh makes a big difference right that's right that's right it it it yeah i we i think that uh part of the the reason we we we got so almost fanatical about budgeting is that that there were those years where we lived that way yes and we're still paying for it oh definitely you know and so the only way to get out from under that is to is to do some kind of budgeting yeah um yeah you don't want to especially when it comes time and the kids are grown up and they're they want to do things like go to college uh you don't want to say we'll still paying for the mistake we made twenty years ago you know and right yeah well that's that's a big that's really important because i do have a college fund set aside for my kids yeah you know and my oldest one is um almost going on nine so you know it's not that many years you know before she's going to be going so i hope that you know i can continue the college fund because it's yeah that's right that's right i know it's important that they go to college when they get out of high school right well you know i we're we're we're trying to put money away for that too and uh um um you know you just can't count on them being totally brilliant though though they are but you can't count on them being totally brilliant uh so that they can get scholarships and and things like that um it's you know right no that's true i mean it doesn't always work that way you hope you hope that they can but you know you can't plan right yeah that's right right that's that's the way you have to do it right no right right or at least loans that they pay off yeah yeah well no that's that's an important thing to me and that's why it was very important for me because i didn't go to college out of high school it was important for me to budget in uh yeah a um college fund for them because it was just so important i said i don't want them to go through what i went through sure right they have to have a college fund so well you know the the i'm i'm also hoping that this budget process will rub off on them because uh when i grew up i had no right exactly no involvement in finances whatsoever you know and so when i became an adult and i was responsible for yeah for the money i had no skills and no background and no tools and and uh so we had to learn it the hard way and and um right yes i know exactly i was the same way so we we're trying to get the kids involved with that that you know when they get an allowance uh part of that's supposed to go to savings for instance very good yeah and uh um yeah and they understand our the our process uh-huh you're that's that's that's strange because ours all of their money goes in savings if they need something we buy it for them oh yeah and all their money has to go in their savings account oh you know which maybe i'm being a little bit too harsh but but if they need something i buy it for them yeah yeah you know i mean if it's an absolute need sure you know if i mean if they want something occasionally but most of the time if it's a need i just get it right yeah okay we we can uh be recorded while we talk about it okay well is your does your city have mandatory recycling uh recycling no we don't have mandatory we actually we're kind of slow up here and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer and it's all voluntary so that's interesting cities have a mandatory recycling um there there's some places that are strongly encouraging it then that the city will pick it up that's been one of the arguments here i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff but we have to carry it um some distance and some places um you can sell your uh recyclables and um for example um our church was was collecting newspapers yeah when when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing we got like a penny a pound for them well it turns out that so much the problem in Texas is that uh they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to uh reprocess it oh my that it requires an extremely it requires uh essentially a paper mill to recycle it and so the value has gone down it turns out it wasn't worth it for the church to do wow i didn't i didn't realize you would think now up here i i suppose they send it all back to the mill and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of uh actually there is one in northern Vermont so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here i didn't think that you know in the large city that if the next recycling if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away it's a lot of money to transport well yeah well see that's in in Dallas there there no plan to build i think that there's some in East Texas there's some pulp mills but uh you have to go to Houston and uh it's interesting and then there's places that'll buy metal and they still buy aluminum can in fact that do you have to buy metal copper is a very good one to collect even aluminum yeah so well do you do do you do recycling uh we do do recycling and our city will pick up our recyclables they have these little blue bins um i don't recycle personally i i'm saying i want to do it oh but i don't get a lot of magazines i don't get a i don't buy the newspaper but i do have a lot of uh my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cardboard a lot of different papers and cardboards well do you do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans yes but we have a bottle return a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles we've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years oh so it's worth taking them back well see we don't have we have we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles oh they should definitely get um the nickel returnable it's great for the kids because see a lot of the kids get the money from it and it's great for the boy scouts running around they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes oh that's interesting you know that you know that there is a down side to all this you know about no good deed going unpunished that uh my mother sells um trees that they make paper out of and so every time i recycle newspapers uh in fact there's uh there's a uh Kimberly and Clark the the makers of kleenex and such yeah has a uh a big paper mill in fact i almost went to work for them i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me but it's twenty or thirty miles from my house every time you recycle that's one less tree my mother can sell and uh so it's a question should i be diligent and um um and recycle and and recycle and put my mother out of her livelihood uh uh yeah i see that but it it it's an interesting point though that uh you know everybody's so anxious to recycle and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment but uh but it takes away employment from the resource that its using well but in general i think it's a good idea because there's like the glass you can't argue that the glass it doesn't biodegrade and and uh the plastics obviously they don't i do too uh they don't either so we might as well recycle those yeah like i say it's not a very controversial thing everyone thinks we should do it it's just that we're so lazy i mean like personally i don't want to clean my i just have can cat food i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it and put it in a separate bin yeah you know i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash well that's what we've got ours we we started about New Year's we decided we'd get ambitious we took one load over there and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff and you know it it it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these uh containers over there well i think i i would be like when i bring my bottles back um if if if they're pretty clean and stuff so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over and bring them over now if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean like if you said wash all the cans and things i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much but if if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it but um i produce quite a bit of trash my you know house and i see it but i don't see so much that i can recycle like i say it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard i'm not a real plastic person user but a lot of paper yeah um pretty much and i and i don't know how they sort that but if if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles i would think that i would i would have a recycling center but now it's just me and my husband so i don't know but every little bit helps right yeah i know what you're saying like well we have it at work we have a very aggressive recycling at work and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin see some people the recycle bin is on their way out what instead of carrying your newspapers when they get done with them at the end of the day they throw them in the trash well do you have separate trash cans at your desk um no we don't but other other offices do they have a box for papers well we have we have one that's recyclable and and then for uh lunch sacks and and waste food and and they gave us a list of things that aren't recycle and it turns out it's not so bad i i i get a lot of reports that that are covered in plastic or plastic like Saran Wrap or something anyway and then uh and cardboard there's a few interesting that we're we're recycling computer type paper yeah and and and uh one day they'll pick up uh the the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper and then the next day they'll pick up the other so oh depending on how much uh you know and there's a lot of uh actually it works pretty well and then we have uh uh waste uh cans for aluminum in the in the break areas at work and so well that's that's a really good idea because um like our uh fruit fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit it oh they're they're thinking about putting a deposit on them because pretty much you have to you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans where they're so much easier just to put a deposit on it because most yeah probably ninety percent of the aluminum cans do have deposits because they're beer and soda but when they sell juice it's some strange quirk in the law you don't have to have a deposit on it and even like the you know a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it but if it's got soda in it it does so it's a strange that's an interesting distinction that yeah they should they should clean clear that up it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on uh on the uh juice cans as easily as the soda yeah so but redemption centers are a big thing up here they get a penny a can they handle they give you five cents and the when they return the can to the distributor i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can well see well see those of us that don't have state income taxes yet that's the big debate here in Texas that they their the legislature wants to put one in and it's interesting what people get upset about uh yeah it it really is the the is bottle is bottle return down there a heated debate well no the the big issue was is is uh when we moved here a few years ago is whether it was okay for you to uh drink beer while you were driving your pickup truck oh yeah and throw it out the at the and at uh so well we well well well here you can't can't drink we're we're now civilized now you can no longer you you cannot drink beer and drive but uh but it was it was actually legal well yes well i know i was in Atlanta and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand but here let me put that in a paper cup for you so that was strange but
