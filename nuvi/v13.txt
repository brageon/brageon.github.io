they've been in a courtroom before um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do oh of course yeah oh no they're they're in California and they're they're waiting list is about four years four or five years for a civil case ooh Lord so uh yeah i mean you know it's very difficult to it'd be nice if justice traveled that quickly but but it sure it it sure doesn't yeah it would yeah no not at all you know the wheels of justice grind slowly yeah well it's not really justice's fault but that's on a another whole subject altogether yeah i'll agree with you there i'll agree with you oh i know i know the shortcomings too yeah yeah yeah oh let's see what oh i guess i've got a two year old so we do Sesame Street everyday uh well not it's not on my that's not on my list of no not it not no it's a it's not something now there was some of the some of the classes i'm in i think i'm in Sesame Street but uh yeah some of the professors i think imitate Big Bird uh oh yeah have an intellectual role of Big Bird that's pretty good that's it i mean Big Bird would make a good judge better than some of the judges i've seen oh that's true that's true yeah i've got my own pet peeve about judges but uh oh well we're stuck with them yeah yeah that we're kind of stuck with them sort of like lawyers you know oh um let's see what else is oh i like A&E i wish i wish we got i wish we got that on our cable system we don't there's always good stuff on A&E they don't have A&E on cable in Dallas well not where i am not we're we're in far north we're i mean we're uh-huh i'm thirty five miles north of Dallas in McKinney it's a small town there's only one cable system here and i've called griped about them not having A E A&E but they don't have it i mean in Dallas they do oh oh yeah i'll tell you the um uh A&E and Discovery and CNN i couldn't i couldn't live without those oh yeah i watch oh i like C i like CNN's new uh news coverage better than anybody's oh yeah i i just leave it when i'm home during the day i just leave it on just to listen to it yeah during during when the war was real hot and heavy we just had it on CNN all day long yeah best coverage yeah oh the oh much better than anybody else's yeah uh the networks got sort of ridiculous with they they they felt like they had to interrupt normal programming for all this but they didn't have anything to say now they're plus they had all the inaccuracies were ridiculous then they'd come back five minutes later and contradict themselves to oh it was just get it was ridiculous so i just oh yeah yeah yeah well the coverage was a little bit ridiculous anyway i mean um-hum it it it got far more coverage than it should have i it was it was beautifully played out thing i mean yea h oh yeah it it roused the patriotism of the of the country and all that sort of stuff and but uh they they interrupted for no good reason a lot yeah exactly i mean and sometimes they they would now i like Jeopardy and Jeopardy comes on here at seven o'clock uh-huh uh-huh and for i don't know it must have been two or three weeks there they were doing this expanded nightly news oh yeah you know and i'm going i will never get to see Jeopardy again rehash it was just rehash rehash total oh yeah i'm saying what are you telling me that you didn't tell me in your first half hour nothing and i i know i know the scud attack scud attacks are some are exciting to somebody but after you've seen them seen them for two weeks in a row nothing yeah oh well there goes a patriot missile oh well that's good that's good across the black sky a white streak yeah oh boy golly gee well maybe maybe we're a bit uh uh oh jaded yeah we are and and because television's brought everything into your living room yeah well i it was interesting it was interesting but it wasn't an exciting war it really wasn't no i mean there there there was nothing to it i mean which is that's good that's good but i mean yeah i'm happy for that for TV coverage it's pitiful i'm happy for that but but unfortunately i sort of had the inside track because i'd been in the i'd been in the military for thirteen years and i worked and i worked in intelligence oh oh and and there was no contradiction in turn yes another one of those military intelligence ha ha that's what that's just like justice for all yeah but i mean my goodness there's they're sitting here making all this big deal out of the Iranians i know and i'm sitting there thinking to myself uh-huh sure um-hum i mean they've poured billions of dollars into this stuff but those stupid people can't read comic strips i mean how do you expect them to operate tanks no they can't it's put it in Russian yeah i mean they can't even read their own language yeah it it it was just it was the coverage just went way too far yeah i it just totally ridiculous i mean the Israeli's could have fixed the whole problem years ago if they just sent sent their guys in there and killed Saddam oh that's that's what my husband says he says just send the Israeli's in to to pick off Saddam they'll they'd love it i mean that's right i mean the Israeli's aren't they're not afraid of anything huh-uh no see what happens when they when they take a plane load of their citizens down in oh yeah that doesn't uh that doesn't that situation doesn't sit around and develop very long no i just wonder what's going to happen to the hostage to the the hostages that's over in Lebanon now that you hear all kinds of things all right i i i think everybody's jumping to conclusions i don't think anything's going to change you don't think so i just no first off i don't think the the Middle Eastern situation's going to change i don't think that oh that's true oh are you kidding but they all hate each other they're not yeah they're not going to come up with they're not going to come up with a peace plan or any of this kind of crap huh-uh you know you you see them on interview they interview everybody and everybody says the same things um-hum yeah that they always have well they they get Oshmid Yakomo you know the janitor for the US Embassy and you know oh yes i know yes i keep saying when are they going to knock on my door and interview me they've talked to everybody else in the world yeah really and it was it was real it was even worse here in North Carolina because because a lot of the was it matter of fact all the units the Marines and and uh the F the F-16 squadrons came out of North Carolina did they so every night on the local news they were down in Fayetteville or they were down in Goldsboro and they were talking to the military wives you know oh yeah oh yeah and and i and i understand the way they feel about their husbands and wives being over there and all that but to get on camera and just oh this is so terrible i just i don't what we're going to do well i'm thinking to myself oh yeah you know what do these people think they were getting into when they joined the military they're they're voluntary army you know i'm going it what did you think it was uh-huh a paycheck uh-huh yeah they do they think it's a paycheck you know run around and and play soldier well the reservists sure do we had a reservist here in North Carolina who who yeah who's unit was ordered up and he refused to go we had a doctor that did t hat here i hope he got busted oh yeah she did yeah the uh this this guy did too he ended up going to Leavenworth which is good i'm glad yeah i mean just when uh the they military paid for her education um-hum and they kept having her on the news every night and then and then she that's right then she didn't want to do her obligation yeah uh-huh ooh she's she's in hot water well i you know i'm not i'm not racist or anything but one of my one another one of my pet peeves is they had a lot of Black on the news talking about how unfair it is because the Blacks are poor and therefore they don't have a choice but go in the military oh yeah oh yeah so there's more of them getting killed than the Whites oh yes now to me that doesn't make any damn sense it nobody forced so Eric what do you think um that well i'm more more interested in the long-term effects than the short-term effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um yeah i tend to view um and i i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected so you think that they that those products should cost more in well i think i think my long-term sense of of budget concerns is that we're going is a lot of others government's spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is um-hum yeah government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care um-hum um but that's a very long-term sort of concern um i don't i don't have great short-term effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i don't see any real uh real immediate hope i mean it's the whole quota's living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly wow um-hum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i i didn't up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of um-hum you you don't have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh yeah well exactly um-hum um-hum and uh it it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house yes well i i don't know anyone who paid cash for a house that's for sure yeah you don't have much um i really i mean so what choice do you have then i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but that's not really a possibility at this point it has it's own inertia and yeah i did it's just that uh there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down yeah i hope so you know that's the problem that i think we have yeah well i'm i'm in academics and actually i'm in the job market now trying to get a professorship and i'm watching uh the education budget getting cut back so severely um at least in California where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh um-hum yeah because i'm i i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment um-hum there is and i don't know it's amazing that in the last ten years we've gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation yeah in the in the course of a decade um we are a lot has changed more radically um-hum and well we were we were in debt before that it just wasn't as apparent yeah it was it's it's uh seems to have worsened considerably somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back and that hasn't happened um-hum um-hum yeah well uh i can see you know it's it's it's it's kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back it's a lot us that you know we don't really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and it's the um-hum oh that's true i hadn't thought of it that way i think and it's the governments it's the governments should that that's really what we do you don't go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um they're personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low because it's they didn't they didn't borrow i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldn't feel very happy about it yeah that's true yeah that's true um so it's a sort of like this is uh i see a i don't know there's if there's a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to yeah yeah in some in some cases it uh i think it's actually going to you know the people that it's intended for in other cases uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government that's in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where it's um-hum um-hum supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not um-hum um-hum yeah i i i tend to get a little upset about loans to countries to obviously corrupt governments um yeah there a number of them for political reasons because we're enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but it's hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point yeah um i don't really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that they're trying to be they're that they're supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal but i can't really understand why um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage um-hum um-hum of someone's well if if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted um-hum toward the top end if i i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money you could afford to pay more taxes i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldn't bother me a bit um-hum um-hum um-hum well boy uh i mean i completely agree with you um on the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years um yeah they used to have and what do they i don't know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent yeah it's it's and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic um-hum you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent um-hum well the US pays the US pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country um you know well that's they they get well it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized um-hum yeah they they get things that they pay for women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they don't have to live um um-hum um-hum um-hum hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood um-hum yeah i i think that's um well i think that's an important thing personally um um-hum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you don't have the corruption and in uh um-hum well they medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and yeah i think the the Americans that i know who are are are sort of antitax a lot of them seem antitax because they're distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it seems to be an an an attitude i hear is a lot of people and i think you hear that attitude you if you go to Sweden you won't hear that as much people will say well we need those services and we're it makes our country great so we will are more willing to pay for it uh hum yeah yeah i think that if we could model you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have um-hum um-hum yeah already working and adapt it that that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today um-hum yeah well it uh it may not last once they i hope it does but it's uh it's uh sad situation part of this this you you hear the phrase creeping socialism hum which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um yeah you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping okay um now the term personal computer uh i don't happen to have one at home um but i do have a personal computer on my desk here a type of work station yeah uh yeah just kind of it's kind of a kluge that was pieced together to to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process and uh it it works just fine it says it's a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer uh no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine no it's not even that it's eighty eighty eight uh i think that's about where it is okay uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM uh nothing extremely complex okay uh i use them both here at work and at home uh-huh and i have IBM clones in both cases yep here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine machine oh yeah i bet that's a pretty nice setup yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it yep uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size wow and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it's knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it's knees yep wow just in the ability to handle and then i have uh a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine uh-huh at home and i'm really pleased with it uh-huh it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches sure uh-huh uh what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you yeah yeah to try to make them more effective and useful right have you been uh struggling along those lines well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody's going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it's uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it uh-huh the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that oh of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error huh not a fun thing to try to recover from very frustrating i can believe i can believe that uh but again i've been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise uh that was a engineering spec on B2 you come here with the B level of specs no not really i'm not that up on that sort of thing well it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build oh okay uh to one level down from assistant description oh okay okay oh well it sounds like you're pretty much into computers well i sure need them uh there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them i can believe that well it's it's been interesting yes uh maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things i think that's when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have when you start seeing what all they can do for you yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing well i understand that you know if needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eighty six machine at home oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six right that that must be a fairly recent
