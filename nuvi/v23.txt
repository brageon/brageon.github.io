oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be but if i say the wrong thing to my youngest son he he will he won't cry anymore because he's too old but he gets hurt he bruises very easily and and i can feel that yeah right that's that's Matthew he's it's boy uh he was always he just he'd keep it to himself a lot of times but he'd really kind of well up and yeah and be ready to cry or whatever he's gotten now to where he can take it better he'll dish it back a little bit but i remember when i first took my kids out uh fishing and again i was with my two sons and not with my daughter but uh no i was with my oldest son uh my youngest son wasn't old enough or i didn't think he was old enough to take out and uh uh we caught this fish it was uh it was a fairly large size fish and he was very very proud it of he put it on the backseat on the floor and it was waggling around and we we came home and he uh he wanted to show his mom what he caught because it was his first fish and he wanted to put it in the bathtub so she told him no he couldn't do it but he did it anyway fill the water filled the bathtub full of water and uh huh uh put the fish in it now after the fish died from being handled so much uh we brought the fish and he put it out in the swimming pool so after he realized the fish wasn't going to come back uh to life again we went out there and they buried it uh and uh you know we did did it together and i i come in the house and i wash my hands and i turn around and i did something and i saw the kids out there with sticks digging it up again and i went out there said what are you doing he said i wanted to show my friend the fish that i caught yeah so he's so he's out there digging it up yeah that was i'm sure it was a powerful experience for him it's something he'll remember yeah well it was his first fish he didn't he didn't want to hide it he wanted everybody um regarding health care it's funny because i have a sister who lives in Europe and in Europe that's the way it is health care is just um-hum they have socialized socialized health care right exactly and um the the interesting thing is that it seems that they don't even think about it it's not anything that seems to be um you know costing everybody a lot of money it's not a major topic of conversation it's just something that's done and accepted how do they pay for it how is it financed well um i think the government subsidizes most of it but i i believe that that again just people are taxed oh a little bit more but it's just interesting how something you know that we consider just such a major issue is just in such working order there yeah you know what do you feel about it well i feel like something needs to be done here and i'm definitely in favor of the government i just think medical you know medical costs have as i've seen over the years just go up and up and up and already just this year yes you know i'm a single parent and you know i have to pay for medical insurance and it's just outrageous my son you know has got allergies and he's got this and he's got that and he broke his arm i mean and you know it's a thousand dollars here a thousand dollars there um-hum um um-hum and you know even though the insurance is paying eighty percent of it you're pay an arm and a leg for the insurance first of all and then you're still paying yeah the twenty percent and so um-hum the twenty percent and and the sad part is that people to to you know combat this they just won't go to the doctor or they won't fill their prescriptions yeah or they can't yeah they just can't i mean that you know that's the alternative yeah i've been in positions before where i've had to wait a few days you know to have a prescription filled because i just didn't have it um-hum um-hum and i don't think that that's fair i don't think it's fair you know to the kids and and to the people that are sick and i know that you know i know um-hum every city has you know their you know their free hospitals or whatever and i know a few people that have had experiences in those um-hum i've been fortunate enough not to but i mean you could go down there half dead and still wait you know it's hard to see a doctor from what i've heard oh i know i know oh yeah it's true and i don't think that that burden should be put on companies either i don't think that they should have to assume the responsibility of paying for the person's health care well yeah there's a lot of people that um you know don't work oh yeah um-hum you know and don't have it you know any other means they've and so they either don't again don't have it or they have to take it out themselves and pay an arm and a leg for it um-hum um-hum you know i'm thinking of you know i just did my tax return for the last year you know if your medical bills are more than a certain percent of your income um-hum um-hum you know it's worthwhile to itemize and and last year i was the first year we reached that mark um-hum oh you did where my medical where it was worth it to itemize for medical expenses because they were just they were that much of a percentage of my income that it just wow um-hum um-hum you know i just did it it's very frustrating a hot topic for me i know well and well you know you're not the only one though um i'm in a situation where when i started my job they were paying full benefits i thought great you know can't get any better and then slowly each year you know now they're down to seventy five percent and then they went down to fifty percent and and i understand they have to do that with the prices going up and up um-hum um-hum but um you just might as well knock of a couple thousand dollars from your salary you know to pay for this medical care and then i i don't have kids so i'm not worrying about family coverage oh at least at least but once you get into family coverage it's crazy oh it's out it's outrageous and then a lot of companies you know offer you know you can have a certain amount deducted pre tax from your pay check for medical expenses but not covered by insurance but it it's just crazy yes you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i um-hum um-hum know people at the end of the year you know that have had that money checked out regularly and then it's like well let's see i guess i could go get a new of glasses you know right they have a hundred dollars to spend in December i know what you mean you know get a big crown done you know things like that but yeah we do that too we're fortunate though this year somehow how it's only March and we've already used up our entire amount i don't know if that's good or bad i know yeah um do you think that that that the insurance and all they've got in Europe does it cover dental or is it just medical i don't know um i think it covers a portion because like i said my sister lives over there and they they just they just never have to worry about it i think it might not cover full dental but it does cover some and again it covers you know um-hum major things it won't cover cosmetic type things you know if you choose to do something but um it's just like all in it's just all in practice it's all in plan i think that we could learn from that yeah what motivates people to go into medicine are the doctors you know how how do the doctors i don't know i really don't know i know that they do equally as well there as they do here i mean doctors still have that same status they do so they're getting paid i don't know i guess they're getting paid for it one way or another and and i would imagine although i don't know maybe there still are private practices there i don't know yeah i yeah i don't know either i don't know but um it would be great and and if only i mean health is probably the one thing that people should be most concerned with you know especially that makes a good society when people are healthy and they're not you know they're not stealing for money to pay for their doctors' bills yeah you know they're they're going to work every day because they're not sick you know i mean just something that should be more of a priority than it is now yeah i definitely agree and i remember back in high school being on the debate team and that was one of the subjects one of the debates should we have you know national health care and i remember debating for it yeah um-hum um-hum well at least let them start off gradually you know fine so they won't jump into paying full health care let them pay you know partial and each year just you know let's increase it from there yeah yeah right i don't know but i i don't know it's going to be hard to switch i think that we're going eventually end up end up that way though i just don't see how we can yeah i think it'll take um-hum it'll take a while maybe our grandchildren will know it i agree it'll take a while but i think we have to be headed yeah um-hum have to be headed in that direction um-hum well it was nice tal king to you yeah maybe one day we'll all have health care nice talking to you too first person from not from Texas that i've talked to it's what you're the first person not from Texas that i've talked to oh i know like i said everyone's been in from Texas all righty well take care okay bye-bye okay you too bye-bye okay well i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows okay and they kind of are in different spectrums i think um one of them's Quantum Leap and the other one is Night Court and i think i think they're real different i mean i don't think they have anything in common uh Quantum Leap has i mean Quantum Leap is kind of okay a comedy in its own way i guess but uh mostly it's it's kind of science fiction and it's um adventure and things like that um and then Night Court is just pure you know weird fun you know just um-hum it's it's nothing serious about it at all so i don't know why the two of them happen to be my two favorite shows but they that's the way it is so it's funny that those are my two husband's my husband's two favorite shows too and i enjoy both watching both of them but i used to didn't like Night Court um-hum and i and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much now i'm involved with the characters but yeah i used to think um Dan Fielding was just too too vulgar and too crude for me and and i told my husband that's the whole point but i i just it's he is yeah that's right i mean i find him degrading at times and i guess that is the point but sometimes it just well they they really have changed him though if if you've watched it this season um he's becoming i mean he still is in his own way degrading and everything but uh he's involved in that charity and uh it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought that he really has in fact there was one show that he even turned down a date with some you know beautiful woman just because the idea that he was his mind was on the ozone layer and you know global warming and all this other kind of stuff oh and he you know was too depressed you know to so that was part of i guess his character building or whatever but um-hum i i think it adds a probably adds a little bit of depth to his character i haven't watched um which of course he needed i think uh yeah i think so which in Quantum Leap you get even though the the person is involved in so many other people's lives you still see a a real person in those situations he gets um he's doing amazing things but he's doing them within the bounds of what of normal person would do and i think that's i like that um-hum right right that's that's good point so what do you what do you consider your favorite shows though um i think my favorite show is Hunter and i i like the old series series better when um okay Deedee Deedee was in there yes yeah i agree and um so uh and then the the blonde that they took out the one that got killed yeah i can't remember what her name is but uh yeah i didn't enjoy her i i she was too much of a opposite of Deedee and i think that's what they try to do but i think we wanted to see Deedee there or somebody like her um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in TV Guide about uh about Hunter and about his latest you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them uh-huh and they say that uh that there was absolutely that there was like a a conflict between her and him uh that they never really could get her into uh any character that they could use i mean you know uh the second lady uh-huh yeah yeah the second one the blonde uh you know if you think about it they didn't really interact hardly at all i mean they were never partners they didn't yeah she would go her way and he would do his and i think that's what i didn't like yeah and uh and and even even at the beginning Deedee and and Hunter and would decide that one of them would go do this while the other one would do would go this but uh it seemed like it was almost two different organizations um-hum you know like like Hunter was the boss and and this other girl was not and you know you kind of you're wondering you know well when did this happen you know right so yeah i i i kind of agree with that and i like the new lady better but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there i'd just as soon have the the police story without all the romance well i'm afraid that's what they they really wanted to do um yeah i think most shows were doing that and then they went away from it and now they're starting to go back to it and maybe that's what the public wants i don't know but i just um-hum i like the the cut and dry solve the mystery and that's what i always enjoyed about it yeah well see there was that spark between Deedee and Hunter for a while but they they like started it and then they'd pull it back and they'd start it and pull it back and that really made it a very interesting yeah uh show to where you never really knew which which one was going to show up you know whether it was going to where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners you know and that that i kind of thought was good but um um-hum you know it's it i guess you know you always kind of sit there and you see these two people together and you always wonder why they don't you know get together or whatever and so i guess that's what they decide to do yeah just go ahead and quit the wondering and and yeah but it's it's always been a formula uh for TV that the minute that two people that the two main stars get married that the show ends up well you know dying yeah a a good example of this and uh you know this is uh probably well maybe it's not a good example i've been watching Nickelodeon all last week uh because they had uh what they called Maximum Smart they had Get Smart for uh ten hours a day from seven o'clock at night until six or until five o'clock the next morning uh-huh oh all the Get Smart episodes you could ever see well the the last day all they did was the last season to where the two of them got married and that was i mean that was the killer the series died right after that because well go ahead um-hum yeah i didn't i was going to say i didn't ever watch Moonlighting but i heard that's what killed it that that uh interplay died when they got married and so the show died um-hum the same thing yeah the it it it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they they before they get married you know the minute they get married everything's supposed to be cut and dried and um-hum right and well of course another one of their mistakes i think is they have a tendency to change characters or to change the character's uh uh personalities um um well especially after they get married um halfway through yeah yeah couple of examples would be um well like i said this one about uh Max or Get Well Smart uh the female character uh Barbara Feldon um-hum she had been at the beginning the the intelligent one the the one who everyone always solved the things and and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up well toward whenever they got married she got dingy oh you know why would they do that yeah it it made no sense i i'm guess it's going falling back into our traditional stereotypes which a lot of shows yeah unfortunately that's probably true yeah which kind of like in the big soap opera shows which i don't enjoy because of that um-hum but well do you watch um what is that show uh Who's the Boss it's uh that's on Tuesday nights i think i've seen it before but i don't watch it regularly usually Tuesday nights i'm out so yeah the well i yeah i hardly ever watch it but uh as as i've seen it they've they've done sort of the same thing to where they've they started to let them get together and then they pulled them apart um-hum and i think they're thinking about that exact thing about the idea that if the show lets them uh get together then you lose part of what the show's all about so i always thought that was kind of weird um-hum yeah it's funny how we uh we we romanticize people uh like well for instance when i was a teenager you know you romance um-hum romanticize a rock star but when he gets married then you don't care anymore or something like that and i think it's the same with your characters on TV hum right well do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages a secret or at least they keep it quiet probably yeah i know it affected me when i was younger i'm not into rock stars too much lately but yeah i mean yeah now like Madonna and Sean Penn now i don't particularly like either one of them but um um-hum uh their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together yeah uh or at least that's the way i look at it um-hum so i don't know it would have been hard wouldn't it yeah i would think so i i just the the publicity in and of itself much less the i mean when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place so um-hum having twenty million people watch you do that yeah it's it wouldn't be easy yeah so hum well that's kind of interesting yeah so um well i guess i guess that's about all we need to do isn't it yeah i think we've covered our time it's been good talking to you yeah it has Becky i really appreciate it oh you're the first man i've talked to everybody else has been a female so this is a change well i think i've um you're the second female i've talked to you've had a little bit of variety huh okay well thanks so much bye-bye yeah it's it's kind of nice so uh-huh bye-bye where do you get most of your current events oh well when the war was on i was watching the T V a lot uh-huh but um i haven't been doing it so much now that it's calmed down yeah yeah i was i was uh we don't have cable so we were watching C N N a lot and then trying to switch thank goodness for remote control uh-huh yeah we were switching from one station to another and in between keeping the radio on yeah C N N coverage was really good it was extraordinary yeah we um um and then you know couldn't wait for the newspaper reminded me of when i was younger the uh the time of Watergate and just couldn't get enough of it yeah yeah but uh it kind of get wrapped up in it yeah um i it was the first couple of nights sitting up and watching T V late into the evening and you just wanted to get the latest news what was happening yeah kind of like watching the Olympics huh kind of like watching the Olympics yeah yeah you just couldn't you couldn't put it down you couldn't put it down yeah after a while though it started getting a little repetitive it ran out of news it did yeah it was like you know that what was it two steps forward one step back yeah and uh but occasionally you know you'd stay in tune just long enough to get the latest different tidbit or a different angle and uh you really became addicted to it for a while right right do you uh normally read the newspaper every day i try to um the newspaper comes uh in the morning and i leave for work at seven huh yeah yeah and i usually don't get a chance to sit down until after work the what the Post pretty good newspaper uh-huh and at that point i try at least try to get through most most the front section and maybe you know one or two other sections yeah i don't i don't regularly watch news or uh newspaper i would say i get probably most of it from my friends you know they finally told me hey there's a war going on oh okay uh-huh where do what what newspaper do you get uh there uh just the Raleigh local paper how does it how does compare have you can you compare like how does it compare to the Post oh it's it's it's not even a comparison yeah that's funny because every once in
