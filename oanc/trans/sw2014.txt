 how you enjoy lawn and garden work well yes and no we live um on a cul-de-sac and we're at the end so we kind of have like two yards so to speak and um it's really tough in the summer time mowing because we just have so much yard to to uh take care of do y'all have a riding lawn mower no we don't that's on our wish list one of these days but that's how we get our exercise is get out there with the mower and what we did this uh past summer was we tried to because we're doing we do it the mulching rather than bag it and all and uh we try to do it about twice a week so that was really quite the chore our first house when we got married was a third of an acre and we had plenty front yard side yards and back backyards oh my the next house was uh a lot smaller we had a swimming pool in the back and front the third house we're in now the backyard is total swimming pool uh-huh uh-huh the sides are slowly disappearing into into uh other things and the front's very small so the size of my yard is decreasing in proportion to my age uh i yeah right well that that makes sense though i'm i've gotten to where i enjoyed digging in the little flower beds rather than uh right uh mowing mowing and and i we've got the third house has an automatic sprinkler system which i wouldn't be without again the actual maintenance of the yard uh-huh well see that's what that's also on our wish list we um couple years ago we landscaped our our whole front yard um-hum and um my husband has lived in the house for several years and we finally decided well we're just gonna go in and redo everything and we did that and we debated at the time about putting in you know sprinkler system like in the in the flower beds and we thought well when we do it we're just gonna do in the flower beds and the whole yard you might not do the flower beds i've had a guy that's in bugs and pest control he says you're really inviting termites when you go into the flower beds and keep it real moist uh-huh uh-huh well speaking of termites we had those this past summer too did y'all really oh i had those in house number two and it cost me a thousand bucks to get rid of them and then when i went to renew see the guy for renar renewal the one year warranty renewal yeah right right he'd gone out of business so my yes oh yeah that's that's a tough thing we got a with our deal we got about a five year warranty and we're just yeah who'd y'all go with a place called TKO Exterminating there he's out in Rowlett and i hope that he's going to around yeah stays in business yeah i i the the big ones the national chains Orkid or whoever he is they were a lot more expensive but right right if i have it do over again i will go with a major corporation because well gust because the guy retires and there goes your warranty when he retires yeah i know that's the that's the thing and we thought about that and we thought well we're just gonna kind of i guess take our chances and hopefully end up on the better end of the deal what kind of plants do you have in your garden when y'all landscaped we've got some uh Yaupon hollies Chinese hollies uh the monkey grass yeah we're we're right behind you on those you listen to Neil Sperry too right yeah well actually the first time we relandscaped we did it in the fall they say that's the best time to do it and we did it then and we had Indian Hawthornes in which are so pretty because they have the little you know uh blossoms on them but those are not freeze tolerant and we had a freeze and we had to replace we took about twenty plants back that next spring to the nursery and we had a lifetime guarantees so we just got new plants and put those in beautiful if you want a little flower bed system automatically PVC piping is dirt cheap um-hum uh-huh and they sell connections that go from a short hose you buy a short hur hose and the connections and you lay it in your flower bed uh-huh okay and the the the sprinkler head that you buy at the store fit right in to PVC uh-huh oh is that right and so you just lay that in your flower bed and then when you're ready to water all you do is put the hose into your PVC thing turn it on and it does it right there and you don't have to move the hose or anything okay you probably uh-huh uh-huh oh okay yeah because see that's what's such a pain is the constant moving is the you know i know i know i know i'm so proud of my house with the automatic well that's that's hopefully we did a lot of work on our house this past summer and um we thought the next thing will be a sprinkler system but that probably won't be for a couple of years now because we really did a whole lot this summer spent too much money so well you get it the way you want it and just perfect and sit back for a while i hope y'all don't have to get transferred or anything now that you got it the way you want it yeah well i know i hate it when people do that they'll sit there and fix up their house and then they move and no we're gonna we plan on staying here for awhile did did you hear the price on the discount is down to three percent today the lowest the banks in three twenty five years yeah the mortgages i'm gonna be refinancing the rent house our house and everything else i i just can't wait they're talking you know seven eight percent yeah i know yep yep well anyway  what i like in a good job is i like good salary but also i think they should have insurance benefits and profit sharing and retirement funds like that so that you can plan for the future and they don't do that any more like they used to in the big companies well i i i agree with what you say and of course uh in addition to what you mentioned uh you know i'd like to see them have some uh have more companies have like dental care yes uh-huh and uh medical and dental yeah and more benefits for uh working mothers uh that's right i noticed here lately there's some companies have been providing what they kind of call an in-house day care center where the mothers can come and leave their uh children with somebody locally at the company and go to work and if something happens they're immediately there that's great oh wouldn't that be great yeah i have a couple of teenagers i have a couple of daughters uh one of which is married and has two two small sons uh-huh and they stay in a day care and and they have a lot of sickness because they're around the other children yeah yeah and it would be so nice if uh the company she worked for provided that uh you know in house or or nearby or that's right now there is there is one benefit that uh is uh offered now um where they pay they pay they pay for hospitalization uh with funds uh before income tax funds uh before with funds that are not taxed oh but i think that's more or less kind of in the group insurance field uh-huh so that's a new innovation too for a benefit well that in-house day care is excellent they could go on their lunch hour and see their kids or any time yeah uh-huh yeah that's true and uh let's see what other benefits do you have any others uh that you'd like to see how about uh well i the profit sharing and the retirement they just don't offer those like they used to yeah in the old days of course they didn't have any any benefits at all they preached job security but that that went out fast yeah oh it didn't that's right and uh so now days i guess funding takes part or rather uh uh your benefits are locked in after you're there with a company for five years but the benefits are so small um-hum and usually they're tied in with social security and uh it most people retire on social security now that's all they have yeah right and uh so uh even if you have benefits and you and then when you get to social security age they're not as great because they're tied in to social security benefits so you don't get both of them in full uh-huh so it's hard today to live off of social security if you don't have your home paid for that's right that's right so uh that's what my folks did they're just living on social security they had two houses and they were trying to buy sell one to pay off the other one and oh they waited for like four or five years trying to sell that one house um-hum so they could pay off the other one because they're just living on social security they had a real hard time i see yeah you got to have your house paid for well you know uh benefits uh are great and uh the more that a company can provide the better off we are but it's so hard now for companies to make a profit as you no doubt uh uh-huh know you know most of our companies uh are losing their shirt that's right that's right going bankrupt and uh so some kind of system has to be devised were more more competitive perhaps we've uh uh been uh we were too used to off time and all these benefits that are not uh taking care of us in our old age but we're getting immediate effect of them like for example like seven hour days and and uh when in effect while we're young we ought to be working harder and come up with better benefits so that when we get older we have the uh um-hum we we have those benefits available to us in in a need that would make it easy for us in retirement yeah they don't have to work so hard um-hum uh you know social security again most of the young people today are paying in they don't have any any they don't believe that anything will be left over um-hum um-hum when they get to retirement age course the old bank never gets out you know i heard that all my life there wasn't going to be any when i was on it yeah uh-huh and uh so uh or when i got on it i guess uh we can make our dollar go lower and lower and lower until you get to zero and then everybody can say okay nobody has anything and start over again yeah well the insurance that's that's the main thing that i worry about is the insurance um-hum insurance costs are going up well and they and they just  okay well i don't see many of the current movies i usually wait till they come in the second run theaters uh-huh uh-huh but um what what ones have you seen lately um well we we are the same we usually wait until they come out on video and then just rent them and watch them at home and even then we um-hum yep don't watch a whole lot of the real current movies um we did go to see last weekend Star Trek Six oh you did yes my husband he's a well we're both kind of Star Trek fans i wouldn't go as far to say that we're trekkies but we we both enjoy Star Trek so we went to see that and um um-hum did you like it we did we enjoyed it it was a good movie i guess it's their last one and they the cast they're getting pretty old i don't know if you're a Star Trek fan at all are you i'm not but my husband is and he went last weekend to see it too oh did he like it yeah he did we yes we did it was it was a good story and and they sign you know at the end they signed their name so i guess that that means that really is the end so and um we just went or we rented City Slickers huh okay i saw that recently a couple weeks ago have you seen that one did you like it oh at the movie house or yeah in fact i saw it twice well actually once it was on an airplane and then the second time it was at a um oh it's interesting it's an old uh theater not a movie theater but like a play theater um-hum um-hum that and they've put in tables and chairs then they show movies in there well how fun so it's kind of neat yeah oh yeah that was that was kind of a fun one we'd heard a lot about that and had waited until it came you know out on video and then rented it and enjoyed it um have you seen Doc Hollywood um-hum um-hum yes did you enjoy that one yes yeah we haven't seen that either we're waiting a couple more weeks and then we'll watch it is that fairly funny or um yeah it's it's one of these lighthearted things it's it's not very serious but it's it it was cute i really i enjoyed it so uh-huh oh oh good how about Beauty and the Beast have you no huh-uh we haven't seen we promised our kids we'd take them over Christmas vacation so probably in the next couple of weeks we'll see that one but oh no i haven't seen that i saw Hundred and One Dalmatians um oh did you oh that's fun i liked the do you have kids or did you go just for yourself just for yourself yeah no i went with my next door neighbor our husbands both said no way well how fun it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and oh now i wonder that's not not out on video is it i don't think so i wonder if that'll be the next one they release maybe if that's i don't know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun oh yeah i really enjoyed it i didn't get bored or anything either oh now now did you like do you like the little theater where you go and and watch the movies yeah we have a real nice one it's brand new oh oh and um i i suspect it'll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now it's almost in the middle of nowhere oh so it's not very crowded and it's real inexpensive and it's brand new so it's it's a really nice place to go hm oh well that's fun yeah we we our little community doesn't have a movie theater but we the nearest town has a um yeah they have it's a four you know four theaters in one that has the different shows going on um-hum um-hum and i know they've gotten Addams Family have you seen that one have you Addams Family do you think are you going are you interested at all in that no huh-uh i don't know i think my husband'll want to see it so i'll do the same thing i'll wait till it's less expensive right right because he said when he went to see Star Trek he was out in California with a friend he said it was like seven fifty a person um-hum wow my word and what how much is it for a movie there where you're at i think it's about six dollars yeah is it we were when we went it was four fifty four fifty a person and that seems like a real lot to me even wow yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but you know about six dollars is what they're running and that's why i don't normally go to them boy boy i'll say not that's a that's a chunk we usually get go ahead and get the discount tickets but i don't think they were accepting them on on Star Trek or you know some of the newer ones i guess they don't yeah yeah yeah that's right to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or yeah yeah we usually go usually every weekend we go to one yeah yeah do you oh that's fun so you've seen you have a wide variety under your belt then right yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night uh-huh right right and um the only thing is that when people at work talk about the current movies i don't know what's going on but you know about four weeks later i will oh do they come that soon yeah they have been lately it used to be you'd have to wait months and months and now like i was just looking at the listings now this week they started showing All I Want for Christmas oh wow yeah oh wow and that's a very recent release boy i'll say i can't imagine why everybody doesn't wait till they come there because like you well like you say around here we have to wait yeah well i don't know oh a couple um probably six months to a year before they go to the dollar dollar theaters yes yeah it used to be like that but now  well what do you think about uh funding yeah space exploration well the NASA program i think has been very beneficial for this country and and and a lot of the household goods and stuff that we have today i think has come out of that program i do too um i have been a a big supporter for i guess since the third grade when i uh watched uh uh uh John Glenn orbit the Earth you know and uh been fascinated with it since then and i think it's just in a uh just a great source of national pride oh yeah yeah well and and i i was gonna say you you and i probably grew up at that time where we uh benefitted by the the emotion and the that the program provided all of us you know really got wrapped up in what was going on yeah the cost however i will have to admit that i look at some of the uh problems that we're facing as a country and i'm not sure that we can continue to devote nearly the dollars that we've been devoting over the recent years well you know whenever i i look at uh the way our our our federal dollars are spent and uh really the NASA program takes a fairly small amount of that if you look at a percentage basis and i think that there are so many other areas that we are that's true that's true uh throwing money away that really have you know we we don't see anything for it and i can see i can see something from my tax dollars uh in the space program and uh i don't know i i i for one wouldn't wouldn't take a dime away from them if anything i think i would like to see uh uh more money spent uh uh with NASA and less on other programs um-hum well and i was gonna say there are some other areas they could cut you know i don't they wouldn't necessarily have to cut it out of there yeah but uh no i used to uh you know think that golly it'd be great to uh to fly on on the space shuttle of course that was up until the Challenger incident and uh really brought to to light that you know and uh really we had lead we had led a charmed life uh in think in thinking that nothing could go wrong or any of these things yeah right right and just you know in relying you know just saying gosh you know we really are just super duper and then you know that proved hey uh we were fallible and i mean it was one of those things where it was tragic and yet eventually it had to happen i mean it had gotten to the point that you know the space shuttle launches were just so commonplace and yeah and and you know it just you know relegated to the second or third page of the newspaper uh um-hum they really were but still i i mean it's hard for me to imagine that um spaceflight is something that is going to really be within our reach uh you know or or commonplace for the average person i mean yeah i i don't see that happening either although i would tell you that in a in a heartbeat i would go along yeah i well well i i tell you i've flown practically everything but the space shuttle and uh i it would be hard for me to turn it down if if there was if the offer was there uh they say it it really is something the the one of the things though that i think that's so oh yeah yeah yeah incredibly valuable about the space shuttle we have here in Houston uh the IMAX theater um-hum uh that has you know this tremendous huge screen and they had a program called uh Planet Earth that was made up of um just about an hour show and it was all uh footage filmed from outer space of Earth um-hum and it was spectacular and it it i think that it helps oh yeah you know perhaps and i hope that it does makes more and more people aware of you know the fact that uh we live on a fragile you know a fragile planet and that it it's important to take a global view and what better way to to do that to to see it up on Earth i mean from outer space yeah that's true well and we're probably going to be the only nation for some time now that could possibly afford or be uh far enough along to continue with this kind of a program you know with with the USSR crumbling at this point yeah well and then again well and then again it's one of the few things that we continue to lead in that's true that's real true and and i hate to see us sacrifice something that we've got uh an edge on but um uh-huh um-hum one of the things that was interesting out of that out of that program that they said that uh they compared um uh photographs of different parts of the ocean over uh the course of fifteen or twenty years uh from previous uh uh flights um-hum and uh they could document the change in the color of the ocean and whether that had to do with a change in plankton because of the ozone or the the rising temperature or whatever but um yeah of water yeah but it was interesting that you know you could they could even see from up there how we're changing our environment in in such you know an incredibly short time oh yeah yeah well the capabilities from a uh uh uh reconnaissance basis whether that be for peaceful operations like you just described or military whatever is phenomenal from that altitude yeah uh their ability to to eavesdrop or to to photograph or to uh is just phenomenal it's awesome whenever i i i've read the stories about and you know and heard things about some of the the the things that the satellites can do from up there as far as photography's concerned i mean it's they said that they can  name's Brian hi i'm Rita from Garland oh nice to meet you Rita uh we have quite a in depth subject here don't we yeah we do why couldn't we get something simple like movies or books something more uh more fun exactly some of the boring ones you just kind of babble on i guess yeah well we will we'll just give lots to talk about won't we all right we ready to give it a shot all right yeah that's right okay okay well uh i have a business of my own uh-huh and i feel pretty strongly about it i don't mind being drug tested and i don't feel the employees should yeah i agree with that i think especially in some of the the jobs that the government has you just need people who are you know now you know who are sober all the time to take care of them you know you're paying them to do a certain job and if they're they're on drugs and doing things they're not supposed to be doing no i i i you know i think sometimes that when you fly for example you know pilots and things like that or people um uh-huh that are even using uh automated equipment of some kind where another person could be injured you know absolutely you know and uh well a lot of times i think it depends upon the occasion but you know i've never had any problem with being drug tested and i wouldn't think that other people should have either i guess that's sort of a personal opinion yeah well you know what i think part of the thing that you do when you apply for a job is you you know you tell them that you're gonna do a certain type of work and be a certain type of person and you know i think part of that is living the law um-hum i know if i had my own company i'd want people who are honest in all they're dealings so well i have a private high school and uh we uh get permission from the parents before the children the students enroll uh-huh to allow random drug testing because i've seen what can happen to youngsters who were not on drugs being around it and getting influenced by their peers who are um-hum and there's a lot of it in the public school system oh absolutely i was i went to school in Plano when i was growing up and and just i don't know it was i was surprised how much of it was there yeah and of course good kids try to stay away from it but i've seen kids start out not being on drugs and end up being there because it was being sold right out under under their noses you know yep so uh you know i feel pretty strongly about it i you know i know that there are people that say we're violating the civil rights and what have you but they don't have to enroll yeah you know they don't have to take that job if that's the way they feel about it yeah and i think the second part to that is you know they're also violating civil rights when they're using these drugs illegal drugs yeah that's right they're violating ours you know yeah and i think you know personally i the way i feel about it is it's a lot better that we go ahead and and help these people you know that when we find that they're they're using drugs that we help them to get over that so they can be good people or not not necessarily i'm not saying they're bad people but they they can be productive people well they can be more productive and more useful yeah i feel that way too we don't uh kick them out we ask that we call parents in if we haven't had one test positive yet but right if it did we would call the parents in and uh you know get help for them before it's too late uh-huh absolutely you know i think i look at especially some of the professional athletes and i was a big Mavericks fan for a long time and i watched Roy Tarpley you know oh he just he could have lost his life if it wasn't for someone who cared enough to say let's give you a drug test and find out where you're at um-hum and uh you know it's just really a shame that he he couldn't get enough help to keep his career going absolutely i think it's important that we remember that it's not the job that's important thing it's it's the individual kind of like what you were saying that it's just i don't know to me that's it's putting the focus back where it should be you know sure some people might not appreciate it but when it comes right down to it you're more worried about the individual and where their status is yeah i think so and uh i think that youngsters who looked up to the Roy Tarpleys and uh the other people that have gotten into drugs i think they're going to be more conscious of the effect it can have and they get you know look at what he's thrown away yeah you know a wonderful career a tremendous amount of money uh because he couldn't get enough help to over come it uh-huh and probably wasn't started early enough either yeah no but i think they can influence the youngsters in a good positive way when they're good role models oh absolutely and i think that's the key now i think so too and like it's important you know i don't i have never been against being drug tested myself and so i feel that the owner of a company you know you set forth the policy and you follow through with it too yeah you know and it doesn't exclude this one or that one it's everybody's it's all it's all inclusive yep i know TI does that TI uh you know they never know who who's gonna be called well that's good i i i like that idea very much you know um-hum it's just a random thing that they'll get a call in the morning  okay what are your favorite shows well i it's doesn't seem like i get enough time to watch much TV but uh-huh um the ones that are out now i i've watched that Sisters a couple of times i think that's kind of a good show i've never seen that haven't yet oh i like that one and um well i'm trying to think i i don't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch how about you um i like LA Law oh uh-huh i not because it's realistic but it's entertaining yeah i do like that occasionally i'll see that one um let's see i watch Cheers sometimes do you and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on actually when there isn't a good movie on too i just like to have the TV on if you know if i'm home alone or something uh-huh oh oh uh-huh have either the radio or the TVs got to be on at all times oh uh yeah oh i do i kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately oh really i've well i've been home with a um i have a baby and uh-huh and so i've haven't seemed to have gotten out as much and uh-huh so i'll i'll watch a soap occasionally um-hum do you watch any of those i well i don't because i work all day but um i probably i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days like you know around Christmas or whatever after a while i'll start watching it uh-huh uh-huh and then um for a while i'll ask people if they know what happened and then i'll just forget it oh what what what ones do you get into oh i don't even remember the last time i watched was back in college it was like General Hospital or something oh uh-huh and i maybe watched it for a week oh but um i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around those you know they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera how funny funny oh yeah oh i don't get into them that much it was i mean when when i'm home sometimes in the day i'll um-hum i'll watch them um-hum but yeah uh oh i i was really trying to think i don't even know if there's any other shows that i watch real well you said you have kids how old oh i have a six year old and i have a um he'll be a year old in January so you're you aren't a Sesame Street fan well they do they watch it my six year old's kind of he's outgrown that one a little bit but uh-huh but i've started to turn it on a little bit for the baby and he's kind of he's entertained by it uh-huh so yes i i do watch that one on occasion supposed to be a great babysitter yeah well they're not entertained for too long with it he's he's still too little but yeah yeah i do turn that on hm and i i do like um Donahue sometimes i watch that i think he has some interesting things on it um-hum i know which what time is that on i never see it um that's on at let's see it's on at four oh okay i'm not home then that's why i don't see it yeah i'll watch that occasionally he's got some real i don't know there's some real weird people that he seems to come up with well isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange uh yes yes oh yeah but he he does have some real bizarre things i think uh-huh uh-huh um golly other than that i don't know i what's that guess i'm not much of a TV person really yeah well i guess it wasn't a real good topic for us but well tell me is it snowing up there um no um it snowed a little bit um probably about four days ago and no uh-huh and they said we weren't going to get any more for Christmas wow but do you have snow on the ground now oh well that's nice yeah there is snow on the ground i i wish it would snow a little bit more but i've heard it's raining there oh gosh we've broken all sorts of records they've got i mean we still have some highways closed and it stopped raining almost twenty four hours ago oh really oh my goodness but um oh just phenomenal i mean i you know you see it on the news all the time but until you've really seen it it does it doesn't really hit you yeah but i was driving home from work Friday and i saw there were some stop signs i mean submerged up to the writing on the stop sign and that was just it was amazing to me oh goodness oh jeez so so there has been some flooding and so oh there's been a lot yeah it's it's too bad but you know the thing is that this happens in the last three years it's happened at least once a year if not twice yeah well that's awful uh-huh but the people continue to move back in the flood zones so oh jeez i don't know i mean you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for yeah i don't think i would oh boy well because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood yeah oh what a mess well now do you work for T I oh do you oh uh-huh huh yeah i know this has been an interesting thing to do yeah yeah i do yeah have you made a lot of calls or um i've i've probably talked to maybe just five people my my husband uh is doing it too he's had a few more than me and but it's been real interesting and kind of fun uh-huh oh do you get paid for these um five dollars five dollars a call gosh i wish i could do that we can't get paid for it uh-huh yeah but you have to do it as part is  so uh what kind of home repair work have you done well um done a little uh repair on the um shingles on the roof recently we've had a lot of wind around here y'all been pulling them up huh or just loosening them until the rain came in yes uh it looks like i'm gonna have to get up there again because we may have a leak are you in the section of Texas that's been getting so much rain we've been getting quite a bit maybe not quite as bad as some of the folks down around San Antonio but uh well i'm right uh Plano is just north of Dallas oh okay and uh there are parts of downtown or near downtown Dallas are under water right now i guess i saw on the news yeah so you're probably what about halfway across the state from San Antonio though aren't you well we're up uh we're north in um yeah oh about uh i don't know uh eighty to a hundred miles uh south of the Oklahoma line i guess yeah okay but you're still getting a good bit of the rain though uh we did have a little bit of rain yesterday so far we haven't had any today and uh i suppose that means i should be uh getting up there to look at that uh shingle but uh i had something else planned today so i guess i'll let it go awhile yeah yeah is it asphalt shingles or or clay they're uh no they're uh uh wood shake ooh that should be a lot of fun did did you put them up originally or you just uh uh going up stopping leaks in them yeah no i uh as a matter of fact we've never had a leak actually yet now this we just bought the house last year and um uh just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles so i've just recently had to start looking at it myself yeah so it's a small problem so far but i guess you just have to keep on top of it what kind of roof do you have uh we were in um uh campus apartment buildings with flat top uh oh well then you don't have to do too much with not too much they're just tar and gravel uh treated flat top roofs have you got pretty low pitch on that roof or is it pretty steep uh-huh oh it's pretty steep um parts of it are steeper than others well what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal well uh you wear uh shoes with good traction and and and try to remember where you are at all times yeah i imagine i imagine anyway and remember to yell Geronimo if uh all else fails yeah yeah that would be just too much of a fall for me um have you been uh visit was the house reasonably new or you been doing some remodeling work on it or it's actually just twelve years old now that's pretty new house yet yeah it um this part of the country actually they they say that when the house is uh fifteen it's already old but uh if you take good care of it yeah thing is we've um the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some um uh squirming squirming i call it of the foundation we're just on a concrete slab you know but uh the soil right under this is a clay and it um yeah it's settling unevenly well it uh depending on it's moisture content it either swells up or shrinks and um course the soil right under the slab retains it's moisture a lot longer yeah um-hum and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation from uh from uh drooping and um uh-huh but anytime there's a change in the weather like the temperature uh drastic changes in temperature or in uh moisture uh you get little spider web cracks all around uh windows and doors well that sounds like a lot of fun well usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped and then you patch them up hm what is it like uh stucco walls or uh well this is all uh it's all drywall or wood all drywall uh i think with um wood framing yeah right okay but uh somehow or other that does manage to uh show these little cracks i don't know quite how that works maybe it isn't drywall i don't really know well if they've plastered over drywall i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they uh almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall yeah i think it is i expect that's what it is yeah give it a textured sort of a look and made for kind of a hard shell on the on the drywall yeah i think that's the way this is done fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet so i well that's good yeah well that would that would be in terribly terribly exasperating to have the a slab floor like that swelling and giving like that yes well the uh previous owner had a major problem with it because um oh probably a variety of things uh his neighbor used to have  the most the interesting political development of the whole year and everything that's been happening in the former Soviet Union with the break up and the reconstitution yeah i agree i been interesting to see how Gorbachev has uh been releasing the power to Yeltsin including including the uh button for the nuclear arsenals well you've got to wonder what really happened in the so-called August Coup who really planned that thing out who stood to benefit yes uh i agree it's uh that's some things that nobody may ever know for sure oh well i suspect that Mister Yeltsin probably knows a lot more about it than he's ever let on yeah he may but it'll be interesting to see how this sort of loose commonwealth uh works from the standpoint of uh being as one political entity or whether it's really just going to be kind of a loose confederation well of course there's always the problem of the twelfth republic Georgia that's in a civil war right now what happens with them also uh did uh did those Baltic States did Astonia and Latvia et cetera did they no their no they they went all three of those pitch their lot in with them or Latvia Estonia and Lithuania went completely independent and had nothing to do with the commonwealth of states so they each three separate republics although i think the three of them have gone in together in some sort of confederation while they each are are supposedly independent it may be interesting to see how when they start talking about border defense whether they're gonna i think most of those independent countries are going to decide that they want to defend their own borders well then what happens in the UN Russia supposedly gets the Soviet Union's seat and what happens with the eleven other republics i guess they don't get anything who knows well i think the what Russia's going to bid for is the seat on the Security Council but i suppose that all of the other eleven can or the ten others or however many there are can be admitted as regular members of the UN i don't know if these all are really independent countries or like states in the United States it almost looks likes some ways like the old Confederate States of America is almost what this arrangement looks like yeah could be it's gonna be you've got uh eleven or twelve basically quote independent republics which are in a confederation does look a lot you know i think if we went back and looked at Civil War documents it'd be a similar arrangement to the Confederate States of America yeah could be could be although they a lot of those existed as states prior to uh to their being a Soviet Union so i i don't know well you have to look back to the great expansion of Peter the Great followed by Catherine the Great uh which pretty well set the course for what then became the Soviet Union i mean it has its roots back there in the in the early seventeen hundreds yeah that's true i don't know what uh currency things are going to be done too whether each one will have to completely establish a currency based on whatever system or whether they can rely on the ruble somehow and uh and uh oh i think one person put it aptly the ruble is rubbish well that's true probably for any of them course then the problem is what they do with their nuclear weapons that's the more interesting problem well there's only four states that have any though only the Ukraine and Belorussia and Russia themselves and then that one middle Asian the one that starts with a K Konestan or something whatever that is uh they're the only four and two of the four have said they would like to destroy them it's only that fourth one that worries me a little bit but they don't have any intercontinental ballistic missiles down there either they have short range nuclear capability and presumably not very many of them judging by where that is well who knows what they're going to do with them Russia had ninety percent of them on Russian soil so they're still going to control the by and large the large amount of those well of course the question is what Gorbachev does i guess he goes and writes his memoirs or something he's been offered a position in the United States in Colorado to teach i think he's turned that down now yeah i imagine he would because he'd have to move over here lock stock and barrel and he's still got children and grandchildren there in in Russia so well i don't think he i don't think he wants to do that but he he certainly would be like an elder statesman or whatever well he certainly give lectures around the world if he wanted to do that on an informal basis he could also uh like you say uh write a book probably be a best seller or how i survived the August Coup but really didn't survive it yeah well it's all been a outgrowth of what he started he started uh  what are some of your hobbies well it's interesting to talk about hobbies hobbies when you're so close to Christmas and don't have time to do any of them right right but um well i love to sew oh great i like to clothing for yourself or your family or well i really don't do as much of that um i enjoy that but i work full time so i just don't have time to do too much of that but um or craft uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i really spend spend more time doing crafty kind of sewing yeah you know doing oh you know appliques on T-shirts and you know that kind of fun stuff and and i make a lot of Christmas gifts too oh cute fun you oh do you like for instance what oh well let's see um one year i made a lot of um jewelry bags kind of a little round thing that you draw up with a string you know and has compartments compartments in it and they're you know they go pretty quickly and oh uh-huh well how fun oh um make a real nice gift you know that sounds fun oh yeah so what kinds of things do you do well i enjoy right now i'm kind of into uh tole painting on wood wood type projects oh neat did you take a class no i just i have a sister-in-law that kind of has taught me and uh-huh and then the projects i do are not real complicated i know some people uh-huh just do elaborate and beautiful i i don't think i have a real talent for painting so i haven't done anything like that yet but we've done a few like little carousel horses and yes yeah ooh neat yeah um little for Christmas i made some tulip recipe card holders oh yeah and and different things like that i also well that's neat have you painted on T-shirts or sweat shirts at all i've painted um just with that oh it's called scribbles you know the little paint in a bottle um-hum um-hum i've just done things like that but i haven't i've seen some T-shirts painted on them and they're really cute but they look hard to me are they have you done those yeah no i really haven't i i just haven't done anything with with paint i think i could do some i could do some i'm not an artistic like you know artist kind of person but uh-huh uh-huh right uh-huh um but a lot of the stuff they do really you know evidently is pretty easy but i've just never never attempted it you know never gotten to it i just you know don't have time uh-huh well that's yeah that's what they say i've heard them say that's it's just kind of like coloring or paint by number um-hum yeah but i don't know it it sure looks complicated yeah it comes out looking really nice we just had a there's a gal in the um i'm a school librarian and there's a a mom at our school that right oh um-hum is really quite an artist and she does these adorable um little kids that are just funny i mean i just look at them they just make me laugh they have you know hair that sticks straight out and stuff like that well how cute oh how fun and she also she also makes dolls but she also paints so wow i've had her paint on like a denim jumper these children around the bottom and it's so cute oh how darling and recently i had her to do um a couple of T-shirts for me and my my aide that um have the children on them and it has um a little stack of books and one of the kids is reading and uh-huh oh how cute one's wearing a T-shirt that says I Love to read and then it has the name of our school on you know on the kid's um shirt oh uh-huh oh that sounds really cute so they really are cute and uh she does them so quickly and she only charges ten dollars oh does she uh you're kidding to paint i mean there must be five children on the just you know on the front of the T-shirt plus all this other little stuff wow boy that is something and it was ten dollars to to do that my word boy does she have a lot of people asking her to do it yes yes um this particular one i told her i said if you do this real cute i said you'll probably have about fifty more orders from all the teachers in my school i bet a line probably right i bet and she probably did so yeah well she just did them i just got them couple days ago so i think as soon as we wear them to school and everybody sees them it'll be it'll be good oh oh uh-huh oh have you ever sewn the stuffed animal type things um any stuffed animals or just a few i made two bears this Christmas uh not out of furry but you know out of the Christmas kind of fabric um oh how fun uh-huh oh how fun they were they turned out real cute and they were easy they were um uh-huh you know from the fabric store buy the already stamped on it and all so uh-huh oh well how fun but they're real cute they're real cute you know Christmas looking patterns so i gave one away and and kept one well how fun but i also love to do things that have to do with like either dried flowers dried flowers and silk flowers and oh do you arr ange you know make not so much arrangements like to sit on a table but you know to go on a wall or um-hum oh you know some pretty stuff on top of a basket or around a basket you know the dried stuff around the top edge of the basket uh oh yes yeah uh-huh with the Spanish moss and all the flowers and stuff and um uh-huh oh and i do fabric in baskets a lot with all the ruffles and all that stuff you know um oh do you oh well you sound like you're talented well it it's called talent with a hot glue gun you know  okay the change how women's roles have changed yes uh well i think we've moved out of the stereotype of the homemaker uh and i think it's been through necessity with the economy and with the dysfunctional families yes yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family well women going out to work uh possibly you know if if they're doing it simply um for the money i think you know that for the money if if it's something that they need to fulfill themselves then that's something different too yeah that uh they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemaker's role should be divided equally between the partners i do too when it's a necessity i know uh but it's funny how it's changed because when my mother uh graduated well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before uh she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman uh-huh that's right so it it's changed a lot from then and of course now women can be anything they want to um-hum uh one thing that has not changed is is the equality of pay among the sexes right and uh i don't see any great hope for that being changed in the near future quite frankly no no i don't either i just think that well men are just kind of in charge and they're not about to let women but if you look at the people who make the decisions uh the Senate and the House they're primarily male um-hum um-hum and uh you know big decision makers are still male until we get that changed you know i'm a single parent parent well a single person my children are are grown and married but uh i still have to support myself um-hum um-hum and i you know i personally i don't work because i want to get out there and do it i work because if i want to eat i'm out there working um-hum well i think that makes a big difference and i think it makes a big difference too if if after your children are raised uh you want to go out and fulfill yourself well i did i didn't work while my children were young and i was married because i did want to give them the background that they got at home i did find afterwards though um-hum you take the children whose you know in a in a healthy family which i don't know how many of us have healthy families anymore uh but i did find that the children of working parents um-hum or working parent uh were more independent um-hum and maybe that goes to where it break it's breaking down the family bonds but i don't know of too many families that the women really work because they want to uh most of them are working and it's not to buy the TVs and the new cars it's to survive yes i definitely think so and especially uh in those families that the husband does not have a college education well even you know here our teachers are paid so poorly they are in Utah too and i don't know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work so it's it's not just the men without a college education it's our economy is really bad right now in Oklahoma it's real bad oh is it i don't think it's quite as bad in Utah as it is throughout the nation yes well Oklahoma is certainly in the recession uh-huh uh we've been there we've been here for about three to five years now and it's really hurting oh uh-huh but uh you know i don't i don't know that any woman would choose that a married woman would really choose to work because when you're working and you're married you're holding down two jobs one at home and one at right i i think that that's more though with a mother that's working well yes than than just a wife because i'm i'm not just a wife but a wife i i'm grateful that none of my daughters-in-laws at this time are working because they all have small families and they're just i just think it's so sad when a mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning two months old and it's cold here and take him to a babysitter  well how do we feel about the nursing home right um i have a dad eighty eighty nine years old and uh he has Parkinson's uh-huh uh-huh and there are three of us children my sister brother and i and we decided that we could not live with him going to a nursing home uh-huh and so for two years we took turns my brother and i live here my sister lives in Longview going back and forth up there helping her she has him in her home uh-huh and uh we just decided we couldn't put him in the nursing homes but i decided i couldn't keep on with that right and now she won't put him in the nursing home i think she's getting close uh-huh but the problem with these nursing homes is the cost right and um he has a house and since he has a house it would cost oh i don't know something like two thousand dollars i think to keep him and um uh-huh right uh-huh uh i really need to know more about it yeah i think we're kind of my family's in the same situation my my grandmother is about ninety two right now and just really has lost her senses she's gone senile and we basically take care of her between my uncle and aunt and ourselves and my uncle lives in in Utah so oh it's really it's a challenge for our family because my parents still have a lot of young kids and it's really tough for them to oh yes to handle my grandma as well as as well as um the rest of the family yeah is she still mobile though no not at all we're we basically push her around and she's lost control of her bowel and it's just it's really sad and it's kind of like you said that oh really we've we've looked at some nursing homes and and just the situations that i've seen is most of the time when there are when they they go into the nursing homes they just lose even more than what they had before right they become a vegetable more or less and uh they don't they sedate them and uh-huh forget them yeah and really you know they say that they're going to help them be productive but basically what they all do is they lay on their beds all day uh-huh and it just to me that seems really sad well it really is um my dad can't even feed himself and um he still you know health is pretty his mind pretty much and that's why we can't put him there i guess if he didn't have his mind you know it would be easier to do that uh-huh but anyways yeah it's kind of a challenge i guess yeah well hopefully they're going to clean these things up i don't that they will yeah i think you know i think they big thing is just to find a nursing home that really cares for other people and it's not just the money they're bringing in but it's it's more of a humanitarian thing where they want to help these people have the best years of their lives that are left right and i think that's the real problem personally yeah i guess one problem that they're having in these homes is is help yeah they don't have enough help to go around yeah and see that's i couldn't do it i think that that'd be super tough just because the people that you learn to love you see dying off one by one and i think that would just be really i admire those who can i couldn't handle that personally yeah i have a friend here that i think her mother's like ninety seven or something and um she's been pleased well pleased with the care of course she goes every day uh-huh yeah and i think as long as you go every day to see about them they get better care yeah i think you're right uh-huh and i think as you learn to know the volunteers and help them know a little bit about your family i guess that would make a difference too yeah right well i do you know anything about the um qualifications uh i mean of knowing qualifications of the nursing homes i i really don't to be honest with you i'm just seen i've done some work in nursings homes and i've kind of but in terms of specific qualifications i don't know other than three square meals a day um-hum uh fruit and supposed sanitation type things but i just it seems like every time i've sung a lot and so every almost every Christmas and every holiday you can think of we've gone in and sang at nursing homes and it's sad because really they're not and to me at least it doesn't seem like they're very well taken care of and any of them that no no they're really not but and i think as long as they're is a family member to go in and see about them they get better care yeah i tend to agree with that and i think more than anything for them that's important that if you're going to find a find some place where the people who are around them really and truly love them um-hum um-hum and they know that they're still wanted and they're still they can still be a productive part of society right and i think too often the nursing home for example my grandma's case she doesn't want to go to a nursing home because to her that's just a sign of losing everything and completely being completely unproductive forever um-hum well that's kind of the way my dad was when he had to leave his home he he left my home and went to my sister's and of course you know as far as uh-huh  you do a lot of uh camping up in Utah uh i used to do more when our children are were younger we'd go we'd go for a week and and have uh stay up in the mountains it was really fun well in in the mountains up in Utah or where well in Idaho and we have camped a lot in Utah too but mostly in Idaho we're right we're only about fifty miles from the Idaho border so we've camped there a lot do you camp a lot well i go camping a lot with the Boy Scouts oh oh we do we do several types uh we do several types of camping one type of camping we do is called a Base Camp where we simply go to camp set it up and spend the weekend the second type of camping we do is backpacking where we simply go to an area backpack in spend a night or two and then backpack out and then a third type of camping we do has to do with uh aquatics aquatics well canoeing for the most part we we we take a long oh um-hum trip every June on the Buffalo River in Arkansas for about nine days of canoeing is that with older scouts then uh no the scouts have to have achieved the rank of First Class which they generally get done after a year and then they're eligible to go on the trip oh so we'll have boys on the trip that'll they all should be twelve by the time we go all ranging all the way up to seventeen oh yes i have five boys that are Eagles so they've done a lot of camping too and they've they've uh one thing they've done is gone on a fifty mile hike well these hikes that we've taken our boys uh generally are about six six to ten miles but uh they'll go they have the chance to go to Philmont in July and then they'll do the fifty mile or whatever hiking then oh oh well our camping is just with the family we've well part of the time we've been in trailers and part of the time we've been in tents but uh we've uh and then when we've we've been camping we floated down the Buffalo River in Idaho and done things like that you have you have a Buffalo River up there too huh in Idaho uh-huh i wonder if they're connected to the one in Arkansas oh i would doubt it i think this empties into the Bear River well we do some family camping too where we just all go for a weekend but we only have time to do that a few times a year because the scouts go camping you sound like you're a very active Scout Master well assistant at the moment oh uh but we're very we're very busy because we go camping every month except February and and then in July the boys either go to regular camp or to Philmont and the other months we all go camping my goodness where's Philmont uh Philmont's up near your end of the woods i've heard of it before it's in the uh i don't know exactly where it is but it's somewhere in the Montana Montana Wyoming area oh uh-huh but we we have boys that'll go there in July and they'll go up there for a week or two our our son that's our youngest son uh went to a camp called Life and it was up in uh and that's been a fantastic deal they really put out on their own and they're not they can't go until they're seventeen or eighteen but they're put out on their own and they just have to survive camping here you can go to Philmont but you have to be thirteen as of January first of the year you want to go which is in July so most of the boys that go are at least fourteen oh well that sounds exciting does uh do you have uh children that are scouts well i have one son that's a scout oh how many children do you have i have also a daughter she's a Girl Scout oh oh they don't do as much camping oh well our our family really enjoys camping they the boys will even we live in along the Wasatch and they'll go up the mountains just above our house and camp well i'm afraid the nearest mountains to us are several uh hours away yeah we have a son in Plano that we visit all the time well that's why they call it Plano because it's just plain it's terrible it's plain you can from my office on a clear day i can see Fort Worth which is about thirty five miles away oh oh well i i when we've been down there i just can't believe the flatness of it all so do you live near Plano well i i live uh just south of Plano in Richardson oh yes i know that which is the next suburb just south going down the freeway uh-huh uh-huh well we we spend uh part of our time camping every year we go up into an area and our whole family goes my brothers and my brother and his family and my sisters and their families and we spend  okay where have you been on vacations well i've been to Europe uh England and France uh specifically i like those oh wow international huh but uh my favorite things to do i think are going skiing in the winter Utah Colorado oh uh-huh uh et cetera oh great so when you went to uh you know to Europe and did you go on was that a one trip or three different trips that was a single about a ten day swing through uh maybe six in England and four in France oh uh-huh how did you like that was that too fast oh was it oh uh-huh it was great yeah because i had my son with me uh my sixteen year old son and so uh it was it was a good experience for him to see some of the things he had studied and so forth boy i'll say uh-huh now was that before um before the two Germanies were when they were separate or no it was a it was well yeah it was as it was happening actually uh-huh was it really oh wow kind of uh it was it was pretty close to that time but you were there right while history was taking place but we weren't over in that part of the world so it wasn't really uh something that we oh got a lot of of input into but uh-huh oh how about yourself where do where do you like to go to vacation well uh we take our vacations we mostly go camping in the mountains we live in a little mountain community and um even when i was growing up though we would go to places like oh Redfish Lake in Idaho and um Island Park in Idaho different places like that i have been to uh my husband and i have been different places like to Disney World and i'm not a real big person for flying i just as soon would would travel you know on the ground um oh okay you get some great camping areas in your we do we do area there close i'm a i'm a Boy Scout leader so i'm out backpacking camping quite a bit too and oh boy i'll say you probably are i've done uh mountains in New Mexico and Colorado but i never have gotten up into Idaho and Wyoming and and those parts of Utah that are so pretty and oh uh-huh oh there there are there're some gorgeous places have you you've never been to the Tetons or no i would like to any of those spots oh it is nice now when you go skiing do you you fly here i imagine no um-hum yeah you either fly into Denver or Salt Lake or somewhere and then rent a car and go the rest of the way um-hum oh and do you enjoy that yes yeah in fact do you come alone or with your usually with uh just whoever uh uh the whole office is going skiing i'm taking my my whole office in uh February to Crested Butte and then uh um-hum oh oh in a week mom and i agreed to chaperon my son's school trip to Vale with about fifty five young people oh oh wow i'm oh boy you will have your your hands full how long is that gonna be for and five adults so i'm in uh that'll be uh five days in March oh huh but uh sometimes i've taken my girl friend and gone last last winter i did that and so uh-huh oh well how fun now when you went abroad did you was it a package plan or did you plan it yourself or planned it myself and uh arranged for a private uh residence in um England through a guy that we knew that had a flat there oh um-hum uh-huh and then uh the travel agent downstairs helped me with uh a lodging place in Paris oh and then we kind of booked some other things on our own that was so it was sort of a piece meal thing uh-huh oh well that did that work out good would you do that again yeah yeah i think so it depend depend on where i was going i had good inside information about where i was headed and so i knew uh kind of what i was getting into but if um-hum oh what if i were to strike out to a part of the world i didn't know anything about i i might not do it all on my own um-hum um-hum did you have places arranged that you wanted to see that you know on your schedule then yeah yeah we kind of had a list going of things and we did some trade-offs and we saw most of what we wanted to see uh uh we had a list of far more than we could possibly see so we kind of had to pick and choose a little bit oh uh-huh had to cut decide what you really wanted to once you got there yeah and uh sometimes you wound up staying longer at one place and than another oh well that's fun i um i can get tickets airline tickets through my brother and uh he's a pilot and so we take a few but weekend type jaunts to Chicago and and different places around and that's fun too that's a good little vacation they say you know just a couple days getting away it makes means a lot it oh sure but if you don't like to fly then i don't but i am getting better used to be i'd i'd almost couldn't you're uh you know bring myself to stay on the plane but but now i'm getting better so huh any other vacations you wanted to talk about or well uh i one place i haven't done is go somewhere like a cruise in in a warm climate or or down into a tropical place for a beach vacation oh  do you have any children yeah i have two two boys twelve and sixteen twelve and sixteen um-hum how about you well i have three and uh they're five and three and nineteen months oh so we kind of got a different ball game but uh right what uh do you feel like you have anytime to spend with them well they're probably at an age where they don't wanna spend anytime with their parents parents that's true you actually of course spend less time with them when they get older but it's of course still really important um right i have a kind of a fortunate situation i think right now with my sixteen year old um i work two nights a week at a i'm a librarian and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library they keep it open you know for kids to oh uh-huh do their work and he um and then they the school district hires an aide you know to work for me well my son is my aide right sure oh well that's nice so two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together and there's usually not very much business i mean some nights it's just real real quiet so you're stuck together no i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part yeah so we i have sort of a captive audience so i really do spend probably more time with him than than most you know but um of course i'm away from my other son those hours too but his dad's at home right and so that kind of gives him uh time with his dad then gives him a little bit of that individual time pretty much that time yeah that's true yeah but but it is hard once they get that age i mean their friends are the most important thing there is right and they want to be able to spend uh that's right well i've even noticed that with my five year old she started kindergarten this year and um-hum everyday that she's not at school uh she thinks we need to have someone over and play um-hum and that kind of yeah it's hard i think uh i find myself getting my little projects going and yeah it's kind of hard not taking the time that i should i'm more worried about oh i didn't get this done i didn't get the kitchen needs to be cleaned this needs to be done and and i need to remind yeah um-hum um-hum remind remind myself to slow down and it'll still be there tomorrow but that's kind of hard to do you know you don't see yourself getting right yeah that's true yes it is hard to do right yeah well if you're kind of a person that likes things you know organized or neat or you know um-hum right then i think it that it is hard it's um i think one of the nice things about holidays is that you know it does give you the opportunity to spend more time slow down a little bit um-hum yeah with family we have we often go to Illinois uh-huh for Christmas and we're not this year and it's just really nice because we can do you know the things you want to do and you can do a lot more than yeah just yeah that's right than when you travel this is the first year we're staying home too and uh i think it's going to be real quiet but uh that's an opportunity to get out the games and yeah right we usually do that my my kids even have already gotten out um my twelve year old got out the Legos which of course he hasn't touched since last summer right of course of course but you know but every now and then i mean he's got a lot of those technical those hard kind you know and he wants to be an engineer so he still likes all that kind of building stuff and um we have the train and we haven't had that Lego train together for years oh yeah and um so he sat down and i told him i really wanted him to build the train and we would put it under the tree and that i would keep it together i wouldn't take it apart can't wouldn't take it apart after that yeah and every year i'd have the Lego train under the tree that'd be kind of fun and um so he worked on that for the longest time ever since school was out on Friday and um then his sixteen year old brother started helping too you know so you know it was just kind of things like during the normal rat race those kinds of things never happen but um right right no no in fact in i think if a people would learn to turn off the TVs and i think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication um-hum yeah yes yeah any communication that would take place in a family uh usually people are ending up sitting in front of that which is um-hum and there's always a few people in the family that when they stare at it you know they're totally turned off to everything else the rest of yes you can't communicate while you're doing that right no that's right whereas uh i'm the type of person i could not sit sit still well i shouldn't say i could not but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without doing something yeah yeah me too yeah i don't watch very much of it at all even to to the extent that sometimes i feel almost embarrassed at work and stuff like that people are because they talk so much isn't that the yeah they talk about TV shows and i'm huh you know don't you watch that you know it's the best show on i go no but you're kind of like what what are you talking about and uh you feel like you're a little bit out of it don't you they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's the  okay it's what movies have you seen lately and which well uh we just saw JFK uh like yesterday oh did you yeah and did you like it yeah um i'm a big Oliver Stone fan i mean so anything he does i mean i like but yeah have you seen it yet no i haven't i mean you know it's just about the assassination and everything so is it just more or less the things that we've seen and heard before well what some of you have heard some of you haven't i think it's just it's it's pretty much every it's the most plausible theory that i guess um theories that they kind of pulled together in kind of a um pretty much an order pretty much i don't know it's kind of hard to describe i mean it's kind uh you have to kind of see it because it wasn't what i expected because i was thinking it's going to be just kind of a typical rundown of what you know you've heard the past you know ten years but um yeah i think it's a great movie because uh you leave the uh movie thinking that you know the government actually was involved in it they they yeah i mean they you know they did there's always that cover up and that was in sixty you know sixty three so i mean uh twenty eight years later there's been uh-huh there's so much more that they've done i mean that screw the American people around so it's it's a great movie uh-huh and my family's in actually my family's here tonight um and they're wanting to see it so i'm probably going to go see it again and i'm not one i usually don't like to see a movie you know twice but if it's i gee that's a three hour and like twenty minute movie and i mean i want to see it again it's a great movie oh uh-huh it's really good oh well we we uh most of our movies are we rent them yeah because uh my husband and i are the only ones left home so we just rent the movies and the last one we saw was Home Alone uh-huh and i just loved it yeah that's a good movie i saw that last year yeah well my my even my grandchildren like it when it came out yeah so it it's been a good movie and we've we've really uh we've in fact we bought the video um-hum so uh is there any others that you especially stand out that you like yeah i've seen uh saw Bugsy and uh oh was that good that's a good movie yeah that was on the the racketeers wasn't it what's that that was on the racketeering yeah yeah that's um and the twenties right it's about uh Bugsy Siegel who pretty much started Flamingo out in Vegas he had like the vision of you know Vegas what it could be what it is today that's right uh-huh at the time it was you know just a complete desert and pretty much they built it on a yeah he had he was given a budget of like a million dollars to go out and build this Flamingo and they thought he was crazy it was a stupid idea and you know he built it but it cost like six million dollars because he had so many overruns and uh uh-huh uh-huh i mean there was nothing out there and they thought you know it was stupid so he got killed for it because you know he he never did live to see the right and you know the the great thing is you know his six million dollar investment turned out to be a two hundred billion dollar return so uh-huh uh-huh and they killed him because they didn't think it was going to work out but it's a great movie it's a good movie Warren Beatty did a good job and uh-huh i've seen uh God what else oh i'm trying to think do you go to a lot of movies uh lately i've just seen this past week or so because i'm uh i had a couple past couple weeks off so i saw couple of movies we just saw Bugsy and JFK like in a two day period so that was one thing and i can't think of anything else i've seen lately i mean i i i'm a big movie fan so i mean i usually rent them too but uh-huh well we we really Cape Fear that was another movie i saw Cape Fear is real good oh have you seen that one you've see a lot of the latest ones haven't you yeah that's a great movie yeah i'm a big Martin fan so oh did you see uh Beauty and the Beast no i hadn't seen that yet but uh i'm probably i guess i probably i probably will these at first you know you think of animation as a cartoon that's kind of a kid film but uh-huh but the more i've heard i'm might have had a couple of friends actually saw it and says it's a pretty good film but um i you know i'll probably get around to seeing it do you have children no i'm i'm twenty three but i got a girl friend she's big time oh oh she's been begging me to go you know i want to Beauty and the Beast so uh-huh so you'll probably take her and go i yeah so uh-huh we were we're going to that tomorrow and take our grandchildren so well how's the weather up there foggy foggy uh-huh and what part of Utah are you all living in uh sixty miles north of Salt Lake wow where uh how's the weather down there is it still raining it is about forty nine forty eight forty nine fifty degrees it's been pretty mild actually you know yeah kind of cool for down there isn't it kind of muggy yeah it rained all last week had like record uh  well i don't know what kind of exercise do you get involved in well i basically do the Nautilus i work out at the Y um three times a week and um then i try to walk in between times so and i've found and i at the Y i ride a stationary bike and then i um and sometimes i will do Stairmaster and then then i use the Nautilus equipment and uh i basically like it a lot uh i've been doing it about a year and a half and and i really i really enjoy it i particularly like the machines um that that seems to have worked real well for me and then i do like to walk that's that's my um other exercise that i like to do so and you know i see i feel like i feel a lot better since i've uh started doing that seems to help me a lot yeah i i used to run i ran for about twenty years but it takes wear and tear on the joints so couple couple years ago i switched over to stationary bike and i yeah i do about fifty miles a week on a a stationary bike for to keep my lower body developed and then i work out three times a week with uh weights at home to you know keep the upper part of shoulders and you know arms that sort of thing so that seems between the two of them it's seems to keep me i guess fairly fit and you work out at home then yeah basically i have i have a stationary bike at home have some weights at home that i use and then you know i try to supplement it periodically with you know some walking what have you uh-huh yeah my husband uh ran for a while but it was just too hard on his knees he he just felt like it did his knees in so he went to um he walks and or does Stairmaster um you know depending on his schedule and the weather um but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints too so he he uh the the running was just too hard on both my knees and my hips and the um stationary bike keeps you toned and is keeps the stress off of the joints right right well we um the the place where i work out has just gotten all new equipment so i'm trying to get used to adjust adjusting to the new equipment but i do like it it it uh it seems to um do certain muscles much better i think it um you know works you out in a better place it doesn't uh bother your my back as much and but i it's hard it's like now you have to adjust to all this new stuff and it there's a lot of adjusting of each individual piece of equipment so i i'm in the process of trying to um get adjusted to it but i think i'm going to like it um because it just isolates muscles so much better than the other well i guess they went out and bought all that equipment just to keep you on your toes huh yeah i think well luckily the Y here i live real close to the Y in Plano and uh they are getting ready for major expansion so they're going to they're just going to open up we're going to have bigger rooms and and more room to work out then they've got new weights and and all this stuff so i go to the Y with a friend and that seems to help me stay motivated to to continue to work out well i i just do the self motivation i can do my fifty miles a week on the bike that's four times a week and then the three times the weights some days i do both and then some days it's one or the other just depending on how it goes i know on the weights and the bicycle like you know even even yesterday on Christmas day i was on the i did the the weights for a while and the bicycle but today i just do the bicycle because i can do the bicycle a couple of days in a row but the weights you have to do those every other day so right now now do you watch television or do you just sit there and bicycle um usually when i'm bicycling i listen to the uh listen to the radio uh just turn on some music and listen to the radio when i bike and uh-huh same thing while i'm using the weights and sometimes i'll watch the news or whatever most of the time i'll just listen to the radio though now do you bike when you say fifty miles that's total a week yeah um i do it in four thirty minute sessions oh okay so each each time i do it it it's roughly twelve and a half miles per session and then i do four of those and that sums up being fifty miles i see um-hum um-hum and what kind of a bike do you have what kind of stationary bike do you use uh i don't even remember the name of it any more but but it it works pretty good it measures you know it measures your your pulse and and and your miles per hour and calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and so forth but i don't even remember the name of it any more well the bikes i've used at the Y one of them i can't remember what they are right at the moment either but the the old ones were you pedalled sort of downward you know you were basically sitting pretty much like a standard  okay uh what do you feel about the nursing homes would you put an elderly relative in one um only if i had to that's the way i feel right now i'm uh concerned with both the sister-in-law and the and the mother that i'm uh uh you know one of them will said if anything happens send me there and the other one says please don't send me there yeah it's real hard on both the family and the people i mean yes yes it is it's hard my mother uh well i have four sisters or three sisters and my mother takes turn staying with us and you know she's getting to the point that that i'm worried about her needing more care than we can offer her yeah so uh she can't she it's hard for her to get up and down stairs and everything and i just think what are we going to do yeah well how old is she uh eighty five i see yeah well um would like if do you think you're gonna have to it's gonna come to that so i hope not i we will we will do everything in our power not for it to happen so i i'm hoping that we can take care of her till you know yeah i went through this with both my grandmothers we had to get someone to look after them but we were lucky and we found someone to look after them in their home we didn't have to put them in a home well mother uh mother lived about fifty miles from me and a hundred miles and five hundred miles from the other sisters and so if she if someone could've stayed close by she could've stayed in her home longer yeah but as it was uh she had to come and start living with us and and she gets more dependent all the time yeah well my great grandmother that we had to put in a nursing home because it got to where my grandmother couldn't take care of her she after they put her in there with i mean she deteriorated i mean her health really got worse after uh-huh oh i think that happens yeah i think they just give up then after she would yeah uh and another thing what what would you do if you had to what would you look for well that's um i guess references or whatever from other people first of all and then well i mean all the you'd have to check i think all the licensing that they go through um-hum and i would check on cleanliness and another thing i'd check on is the food yeah my sister-in-law was in in one and uh she just just had her hip replaced and so she just went to one you know for the little time for it to exercise and thing um-hum and they'd feed them really weird things like uh salad for breakfast and broccoli and she was she had her facilities about her and she didn't i mean she knew that they were doing it wrong um-hum so i think they're yeah see that's what it is is most of the people are so old in there that they don't really know what's going on yes uh-huh and i think that they can get away with that yeah i think that's a problem too so you have to i think you have to really check into them real closely and then even after you put someone in there then you would wanna i do too and i be you know be able to check up on them on a weekly basis just to make sure that they were treating them properly um-hum um-hum well the one that i that i we would put my mother in would be about three miles from my home oh that wouldn't be too bad and so i would check her to i mean she was in there when she had her her hip replaced too and so i would check on her two or three times a day yeah it's a scary thought they it is it is and you just you know well it comes right down to it i think it'd be heartbreaking how old was your grandmother when you put her in yeah i think she was like my great grandmother was about she was i think ninety two your great grandmother oh my word and how old you have a longevity don't you in your family yeah one of my girlfriends her her great grandmother is a hundred and two but she still lives at home with her with her family or whatever uh-huh oh that's great yeah yeah no it's a it's a tough decision it's a tough decision to put to put them in there and then what oh it is and it and it you know it's a tough decision to take them into your home when you're used to your freedom um-hum but just it's a lot of responsibility yeah it is and and uh you know uh well it's just like having a child again do you have children oh no ma'am oh you're just a youngster then yeah oh oh well i don't think we've solved any great problems but i wish what no what um trying to think what else we went through oh and then the medication if they have to have medication that's another thing that that i mean uh-huh you never really know and you never really feel confident with anything unless you're actually doing it yourself and if they're at a home you don't know that they're being given their medicine right right and not and uh my mother's on insulin and i think you know just giving her the right amount checking her blood and giving her the right amount they and then again back to the food i think that they have uh if they don't eat if they don't eat by themselves or if they don't want like what's that served that day they don't eat it and i think a lot of them starve to death um-hum yeah they just wither away and well it's kind of like you know you put them in there someone else so someone else can take care of them and then you really wonder you can't feel really confident that they're being taken care of no no i don't i i just think the solution if every but a lot of people can't either can't take care of them at home what hum-um you know if you're working and i i think the ideal situation is like with your grandmother have someone come into their home and live with them and take care of them and a lot of people like to do that yeah yeah  you're in a little different situation i think we're going to set the record in Dallas this year for murders oh really yes uh there's been a lot yes uh the uh and they're mostly drug linked here but oh we have um i really i think we had like four hundred and eighty uh-huh more than one a day my word is that an increase over any of the previous years is that the highest oh yeah it just keeps going higher and higher we're going to have a we're going to set a record for us but possibly will be the deadliest place to live in the nation my word uh-huh in the whole nation yes wow that's terrible does that does that worry you at all yeah extremely i carry tear gas yeah do you that's great do you are you out alone at night often or that not for for that reason no oh now does now is it mostly in certain areas that it happens or just oh yes um you know crime is um i think crimes against property are more common uh you know they're common fairly common all over uh right you know the some it's kind of funny uh we've just moved from a a low crime area because it's got great police to a higher crime area oh but oh i had a i had a pickup truck sitting out by my house with uh all my furniture in it for a week and it wasn't touched uh-huh my word huh so i don't know what you define as uh you know uh for being in an unsafe a less safe area right uh-huh it's there no telling uh my word huh well that i know that um we're a little bit in the same Salt Lake City is um-hum is about an hour away from us and they have had an increase a big increase in the number of murders this year too and they said that um the murders have been on the rise where some of the other crimes have either stayed the same or declined but the more violent crimes like rapes and murders have you know increased and i and i think like you said it's a lot linked to the drugs to the drug uh-huh scene and um of course the little community we live in we don't have too many you don't well you have it believe me but you might not you don't it's not as prevalent i don't right right i'm sure that there's uh we do have one policeman you know that that runs the that is the law enforcement here and um one right we're real small and he's only been hired for about a year before that we didn't even have one how big what's the population um i think there's a hundred and seventy families and i'm not sure eight hundred maybe seven hundred seven hundred or eight hundred is the population well the one person who might snort cocaine in town probably isn't very violent so no no we do have um just up to the south of us there's an area called Docks Flat and it's up in the mountains and a lot of the the kids go up there for their beer parties and uh-huh uh-huh you know drugs and that and that's probably the biggest problem we have right here in the community is is these kids coming up up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of are they local no no they're from oh from the communities around us uh-huh mostly so so they're not in town folks and that that brings in a lot of problems spots but um have you ever been the victim of any type of a crime whether a burglary or oh i had a i had a two eighty or three hundred Z X that uh i used to have the windows replaced on that that i say monthly three times though um-hum you're kidding they were stolen from i have three dogs three large barking fierce looking not fierce but fierce looking dogs uh-huh oh uh-huh that um that sleep very soundly it would appear but uh just from my driveway oh oh that's a good idea that probably deters a lot of oh well my truck i was telling you about was next to the dog pen uh-huh oh that was probably the reason but i think it does but it's um that you know these are nice they don't they don't catch a lot of things oh i think if it's uh if someone's coming to case your house and they knock on the door they're going to draw a response from the dogs but if someone walked around my house uh-huh oh yeah my dogs sleep so soundly during the day too that they wouldn't know oh oh well do you um do you have signs posted that you know say yeah i've got signs that say my house is protected by a security system oh that's good they're lies but you know it might deter them well they say that that deters a lot a lot of would be you know burglaries that what's a what's a crime like there um i'd probably have to go to one of the bigger  yeah discuss funding for AIDS research um yes uh let's see i don't know obviously they're not spending enough now so yeah well i don't know i really am not sure what they're spending on AIDS AIDS research i get the impression it's a pretty sizeable chunk of money i was always uh uh gosh i'm trying to remember where it was but recently uh somebody on the news said that one of the problems with uh AIDS research was that each time they find somebody with you know about every fourth or fifth person they've diagnosed with AIDS has got a new strain it seem to be mutating just like about about like the common cold um-hum finding a cure for something like that could be several hundred years in the making yeah um it just depends i mean i think you know they'll probably spend tons of money on it you know under the AIDS name but it's probably not just being directed in the right channels you know could well yeah the who knows how much of it's you know it's actually going to that particular study where so so much money gets spent on useless stuff anyways i mean yeah the general yeah the general human on promotional campaigns and you know something like for every dollar that yeah that they get maybe eighty cents of it goes to you know awareness i mean that's twenty cents only twenty cents for left for actual research and i mean i don't know maybe the Magic Johnson thing yeah i know he's trying put put yeah i just yeah that might help the it might help the awareness part but uh you weren't yet well i don't know how much he's going to you know actually see i'm just a little skeptical on that because you know first week that you heard all about that you know it was always in the news and now it's kind of just yeah you know you hear only time you hear about it now is when he showed up at a Laker game on the sidelines so yeah i don't know it you know the uh funding situation seems to be the same for for so many of the major diseases so to speak the uh bulk of the money goes to administrative costs um-hum which usually means high salaries for people running the show and a major name researcher's involved with it you know who knows what actually gets done as far as true research seems exactly um i don't know i just better do something about it in the next few years it's getting pretty ridiculous uh out of hand i mean yeah it seems everywhere you turn somebody's coming up with it wild part about it nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is the only safe way of keeping from getting it hm they figured well you know we all want to be promiscuous so go running all over the place and yeah i still don't know anybody personally that's had it i mean i say i guess once that happens and it you know it's getting close you know that yeah but no there're there are people who don't get it from promiscuity but there's the sorts who get it through blood transfusions yeah that's just that's something yeah that's the saddest cases of all of that's so unfortunate the innocent bystandard or that woman who died just recently the one who died just recently got it uh from her dentist something like twenty two twenty three years old died of AIDS she got it because her dentist had it and didn't use any precautions um-hum i don't know but those are the sad cases yeah is um is there big uh what what part of Mississippi do you live in southern Mississippi okay is there um do you all have a lot of um i know i i do know that like down here there's a lot um people complaining that because Dallas they um didn't like hardly give any money for the um AIDS uh programs out here in fact they had to cut back on it you know because the city budget and that was a big there's been a lot of people you know protesting that lately out here and yeah i didn't know i was just just you know since there something like that gone on down there or um right now as far as the state budget concerning AIDS awareness i'm not even sure that there is i know there isn't any on the city level or on the county level i'm not sure if the state's got much of anything on the AIDS awareness i think most of the AIDS awareness information is more or less coming through private sector um the uh yeah i just know that you know that it was just some i mean hundred and forty thousand i think was all that you know for a year's budget that they were providing i mean either that or i mean that'll get you a couple of things but i mean it just yeah you know i don't know i mean course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs uh-huh yeah and they're just they had a little um stage thing where they all came in and started lying down on the city  gonna go first no go ahead you called all right um right now i'm a college right now i'm a college student as a matter of fact so i'm pretty fresh with it i just think a lot of it depends on a variety of thing it depends on for me it was a combination of finance uh-huh um being in a place where i would enjoy the atmosphere and where i'd feel comfortable as well as just the general type of education that the school gives yeah well i i don't know i think it depends a lot on um well all those things decided that's true but i had got my daughter into college last year and it was really a major decision uh-huh but there were just so many things to consider and i don't really think we even considered all of the things we should have um-hum uh so she's out in California oh is she yeah but what we didn't consider was coming back and forth and things like that you know yeah really so that's kind of yeah exactly yeah that was kind of hard so i don't know i think it's always confusing it's hard to make a choice oh absolutely i think you know like you said a lot of it there a lot things for example i go to school out in Utah and my family lives here in Texas and so it's kind of like you said uh i never realized what an expense it would be trying to come home and uh-huh it really is and you don't get to come home as much as you think you will no i maybe have been home oh twice in the last two years for Christmas yeah yeah yeah so it's really hard to do that yeah it is and i think to there's there's a lot of times like you said that's one of the major considerations is you know how much do you want to be with your family or how much do you wanna and that's something that i didn't think about until i was already out there and i don't think you even know that answer until you go either yeah exactly you know everybody's anxious to get going and get away and go do their thing but then they really want to come home and they can't always uh-huh yeah yep that's for sure so that's kind of hard too but you learn to appreciate what you had yeah that's true isn't it yeah it is i know it is so what other points did you guys look at when you were trying to find her school well the size of the school because we live in Plano so the schools are really big here very crowded so she didn't want a school that was really too big uh-huh right uh-huh and we looked at that and i don't know that that's really relevant because you're gonna end up with your little group anyway yeah so i'm not sure that it makes too much of a difference although we did find that like down in Texas um at UT you know down in Austin uh-huh that those classes are so full like you can have two hundred kids in a class yeah and see i think that makes a huge difference where i so that would be horrible you know it is where i'm going my freshman year i didn't have a single class with less than nine hundred students that's horrible oh my gosh yeah and it was it was frustrating you'd see a TA once a week and even the TAs rarely knew who you were so yeah it became a thing like you said where you're where you're competing either to you know to get someone's attention to get help or you just kind of if you're not self motivated where i'm going it's really hard to where're you going um to Brigham Young University and it's that crowded is it really um in the freshman classes that are you have there's about twenty four thousand students oh and so it's kind of it's a lot of fun when you get in the upper level upper level classes it's a lot easier but yeah yeah wow gosh and that's something that i hadn't considered because i was i was raised in Plano as well and i went to Plano East and i never you know there's lots of students but there wasn't that many you know thirty or thirty five in a class i didn't mind yeah where are you in college now i'm a junior junior yeah um-hum my daughter went to Plano East too she twirled oh did she oh cool yeah but she was the only twirler they've ever had so but that's what she's doing out in California that's why she's out there great because we had to consider where a good spot was too and yeah and that should you know i think a lot of it depends on like you said i think for me what i wanted to get out of the college experience had a lot to do with it it wasn't it was a combination of academics as well as other things so yeah yeah well but a lot of times kids aren't sure what they want to be like she started out with sports psychology so we looked all over that was a hard thing to find uh-huh right and then she changed her mind anyway and i think most most people do that i think these days you know yeah see and they say that that's average yeah uh i have three or four times yeah because that's very common so maybe that's not such a great reason to look at a school i don't know yes i think for me personally when i was choosing i was looking more the overall experience instead of just yeah you know but the specific field that i was looking into at that time so yeah well she was too when you live in Plano you know you sort of have everything you really spoiled everybody here at school we all are all our kids are you know to be honest and we went out to USC because they wanted her to twirl for them yep uh-huh and she was terrified she was just terrified of living in LA uh-huh she was too scared to go there so i guess you have to look at that too yeah and i understood it at the time when we went to the campus and visited i thought oh gosh it would just  kind of pets you got well we got two Cocker Spaniels at the house uh a female and a and a male and at the office i have tropical fish how about yourself fish in the office may dad used to have fish in his office years ago we've got three cats meow meow cats meow meow cats that's that's exactly what they do we got we've got um one that's about three and a half and he's black and white and one that's three and she's all white although she's a little dirty now and then we got one that's a year old and is what they call tortoise tortoise hair which is kind of multi multicolored and um she's the one that's most vocal i think my sister and her husband had cat and it was kind of an alley cat and it kept going out in the alley and getting pregnant and it looked kind of like a Persian cat but anyway went and got pregnant the first time they advertised in the newspaper free kittens and and nobody would come over and do anything and then they changed to ad to read Persian like kittens thirty five dollars and they were gone in one day free market it worked well all all our cats have been uh have been neutered or spayed or what have you our white cat has got some Persian like qualities and big and it's and it's very long haired which makes it look even bigger the other two are short haired cats we let our female uh get pregnant as a matter of fact it's AKC so we reached out for a stud and when the the uh puppies arrived we made sure the children were there to see it uh we thought it was a very simple uh course in birth birds and the bees and uh the dog has had two litters and i'm glad the children experienced the process uh i didn't see anything wrong with it as i said we're we're not going to end up with any kittens we figured we had two other cats before these both of one of which died from old age um-hum it was about um fourteen and a half and then one died very young from feline leukemia years ago when they didn't you know now they've got shots for feline leukemia but back when this cat died which was oh some ten years ago they didn't have feline leukemia shots so so it got ill then it got better and then it got ill and died immediately so huh well we nearly lost a dog the second time she had a litter we didn't get her on vitamins soon enough some distressed children uh the dog was just the hindquarters wouldn't work so we ran to the vet one Sunday morning believe it or not they've got twenty four hour vets in emergency clinics and they they charge they charge like that too and uh he said well there's three things and he said well that's not it the second one that's not by the time he got to second that's not the kid's were in the lobby just crying their heads off and the third one got corrected the dog and we saved the dog thank goodness it just it didn't have the right vitamins to keep it going with the the puppies draining her milk oh my so we enjoy dogs because uh they kind of bark when someone shouldn't be around the house we do not let them in the house at all but they're outside dogs and uh what are your cats do they uh meow at all if some stranger comes well i don't think so but they're inside um part of the time outside part of the time and um oh i don't know they uh well they're not watch cats or anything but i tell you what we don't have any mice or or any uh rodents or anything like that they they certainly keep things uh neat and clean things stay away do do do they actually kill mice uh well at one time we know we've had cats that have killed mice and most of time unfortunately they end up killing birds ooh and they'll leave us a present on the back or front step and there'll be a bird missing a head or you know whatever but uh we got in at least once i saw cat one of the cats not this cat but one of them that's now died that that had a had a mouse and one time one of the cats got a a rabbit that was in the backyard killed it no uh we got it to let go the rabbit we heard this horrible shrill noise and didn't know what it was and it was a rabbit screaming for it life so we went out there and convinced the cat to let go of the rabbit well we've got a pet rabbit in the house i forgot to mention that and uh when we've been having a fence put in the dog got to the rabbit and it was no longer a live rabbit oh my well i we where over to a friend's house they had a pet rabbit and this pet rabbit looks just like our white cat we always called the white cat a big rabbit and the fact of it the cat and the rabbit looked pretty similar have you heard about people that house train their rabbits these people had their rabbits outside well this is our we do too it's in a cage but people  hey this is Bryan how you doing this Jay in Dallas how are you i'm fine thanks nice to meet you good where are you from i'm from right right now i'm living in Utah but my family's in Plano and that's where i'm at right now oh okay yeah so calling pretty close at home right now well you ready to give this topic a a whiz right that be great all right here we go all right would you like to go first or go ahead all right um i'm pretty young so i don't have a whole lot of credit cards i when i first got one i made a big mistake and got pretty far into debt and ever since then i've decided that it's if i'm gonna make a purchase i i make it and have the check written out at within the next week for the purchase i made and that way i i keep my credit cards at an even balance yeah that's right i i think that's what happened to everybody out there gets back when they just sent them to you without any i've got i don't know how many tons of them but uh i use uh well this one particular one for everything i mean everything i buy including groceries uh-huh and it runs up pretty high every month but i then i pay it off because i get a a air uh advantage miles on American right with it so i i can get a you know i've already gotten a free trip just from using that card so i don't uh i don't have any carry over balances any more uh-huh right but i just i was wiped out there for years but that was the way to do stuff and uh you i think you have to make the decision yeah right but um Texas is uh you know it's a debtor state and if you get in too big of a trap you you can just blow them off and that's not good but i know lot of people do it yeah it's what runs that interest rate up you know pretty high yeah right um-hum and i agree you know i think there's a lot of benefits for example i know that my sister and brother-in-law as well as my parents they they use them quite like you do you know they just they're within every month they're within five dollars knowing within five dollars of what it is and um-hum and then they right it off but to that advantage it gets yeah you know the privileges of like you said like the the mileage and the well it's uh the interest rates are still crazy up there you know i i i mean they've come down every except the credit cards uh-huh so it's not uh it's not really an advantage to have them now they're uh some of mine are up i think up over twenty percent i don't use them anymore but i think think they've gone over twenty percent a year you're kidding wow and some of them you know i think the one i'm using is about fifteen but i don't use the interest anymore so it doesn't make a difference right and then when i travel i travel a lot in Europe i use Diners Club and that gets all my um uh insurance on rental cars and and plus they have a pretty good uh uh plan on the gifts and things like that i try to get something out of them now uh-huh so well that's right you know i i think too one of the things that i've become very aware of in terms of when i'm looking for a credit card is i'm looking i look for something that doesn't have an annual fee right absolutely there's no use paying that fifty or whatever it is a month a a year absolutely i just you know i think that if you're doing that you're pretty stupid because you could be using that on something that you really want oh sure um personally the not my next project i think is to take those that i do have uh listed and cut them up yeah that i'm not using uh especially the ones that don't i that there's a working asset to these that gives a lot of uh yep money to um the environment and things like that that's my second here but i've got one Cigna Visa that doesn't give you a damn thing so right uh i think i'll cut it up this year for my New Year's resolution yeah and i think i agree with you too you know i'm i'm should have a Visa i haven't this is my first year i've had a Visa and i think i'm gonna cut up everything that i'm not using it's just stupid to have them around and yeah i've got a lot of um gasoline credit cards that i don't use anymore because they take all the others so i might as well pitch them i mean it's just weight carrying it in your pocket right yeah and i agree and i think the one the one thing that i've really learned too is that if you're gonna have a credit card just you know if you're not gonna use it for example like you said a with a Visa card really you can almost do anything now and i'd just as soon have it all on one card so i know exactly where it's my bills are gonna come from and absolutely yeah i think a lot of times especially like i'm a student so i don't have a really big income but i have to you know be really careful not to over extend myself and when i'm using it on other cards it oh yeah you can i was absolutely um IRS checked me one time and they said nobody in the world could have paid this much interest uh-huh and i said well i'm glad you mentioned that because i've got receipts for all that but you know something else i couldn't have proven but uh yeah that was uh i'm not young anymore so i uh took a long time to learn but a lot of young people do get trapped on it it's easy you know you don't have any money and yeah yep and i think it's uh i think you know i was really lucky in that this summer when when i did it i i had enough and i was working enough that i could basically pay it all off within you know six months or so so it wasn't where i was over my head but i i got enough of a taste of it to realize what i didn't wanna do anymore yeah oh sure and they got all those late charges now and stuff they didn't used to have and if you go over the limit there's a charge i mean they're they're really starting to hit us oh yeah you know a lot harder than they used to they've they've  do any woodworking at all yes as a matter of fact i do i uh i i took a lot of shop classes when i was in junior high and high school oh great and uh had a had a lot of fun in it i i made uh a table with a shelf underneath that goes that's for my room and uh oh how nice stereo cabinets and all kinds of stuff oh wow you do do a lot do you have your own tools or do you have some yeah my my dad has uh let's see a a radial arm saw and all that kind of stuff out in the garage that that i use once in a while now i don't have a lot of time for that kind of thing any more but uh-huh uh-huh whenever he needs a help hand doing something that he's making then i go out there and help him oh that's nice so do you um what kind of wood do you use usually the pine or uh it depends on the project really uh oh i think i made my stereo cabinet out of pine uh-huh um something my dad's been he made my grandmother a jewelry box and he made that out of poplar oh oh how neat yeah uh so he's done he's done wood projects too yeah i i i think my my involvement in in school got him in that oh hold on for just one second okay okay oh well that's that's good So do you stain them and all that yourself when you're finished with them yeah yeah there's just about everything i make is either it's either stained or oh uh-huh that definitely is a real if you like the color of the wood it's real nice to just put on that clear finish coat that keeps it sealed up and uh-huh oh looks nice oh well that's interesting i i've always been interested in woodworking i the type i do is a little bit different but i after the projects are done i like to paint them and um you know make different types of yeah oh i just finished some Christmas decorations a friend's husband cut cut them out for us and then we you know got together and painted them yeah and um he does you know he makes the shelves to hang on your wall or he makes bookshelves or corner cupboards and i think it's fascinating i i really think it's if you have the tools yeah i think you'd have to have the tools to make it yeah it's it's a lot of fun as long you you got the right tools and everything uh-huh oh do you so you don't have much time for it though even though you you have access to the tools now yeah yeah right i haven't done anything on my own for about six years now uh well now do you follow a pattern or do you just kind of uh start measuring and cutting or if if you're if if you start to make something you have to like basically draw draw the design of whatever it is you want uh-huh and and determine the the measurements uh of everything oh and then make sure that that make sure that that what you put on paper will work and then put it to wood uh-huh oh do you save a lot of money rather than buying the finished project yeah you you really you can save a whole a a a lot of money oh you can go to a like a a furniture shop and a stereo cabinet like i built only a lot smaller would cost you probably in the neighborhood of forty to fifty dollars uh-huh oh i think i spent a total of maybe fifteen to twenty oh wow that is a big difference yeah and and had wood left over and you know to use for other other things oh wow oh that is a and it and it and i and i got my when i made it it's made to the specifications that i wanted because i have an oversize stereo um-hum um-hum that wouldn't fit in most newer stereo cabinets because they make all those uh-huh so you got what you want besides getting it for a better price and yeah they make all those smaller components and this is a stereo that i've had since i think about nineteen eighty oh so oh well that's great how do that that kind of thing works out to your advantage as well you can make it to to fit your design instead of whatever they give you right huh so you've made the a stereo cabinet and what else did you say uh i've made a it's a it's a table that has a shelf underneath oh uh i've made a it it's supposed to be a uh old style lamp holder you know like oil lamp holder uh-huh oh oh how neat with a with a mirror in the back of it but i don't have a lamp to put in it oh so i just use it as a mirror in my room uh-huh uh huh well that's interesting i i like a lot of the old-fashioned type furniture the washbasin type things and i guess you could make that yeah now where you don't find those in the stores to buy very often you can make the kind of right things that you want have you ever made any type of chair no i i never dove into the chairs it i wonder if they would be a harder type project would it um it depends on how intricate the the the design is and whether or not you're going to uh  uh let's see personal computers yes so do you use them uh yes um we own one terrific what kind uh its an Emerson eighty eighty six um two low density floppy drives and no hard drive yet but uh you know it's it comes in mighty handy mostly for word processing type things uh yeah a big chunk of it's word processing we're also taking programming classes and uh so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it but uh the uh right now we got a project going we're trying to put um all my wife's stray recipes on the disk nice did you buy a program to handle menus uh it came with a menus program but uh that doesn't it is maceboast excuse me mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive oh yes and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured there's eighty eighty eight is what you said eighty eighty six eighty oh gosh it's worth your time to just upgrade they're so darned cheap now which computers ah impoverished college student oh no this one went on a credit card and we got a way out while to pay it off yet so it's ah i've i've got one at home too it's a three eighty six thirty three megahertz forty four meg RAM RAM and hundred and thirty meg drive and uh oh that sounds nice super VGA and yeah it's fun i do programming too my job is uh EDP auditor and so i'm into computers all the time EDP electronic data processing okay that sounds like a fine job yeah i really enjoy it and it treats me well yes uh what are you studying in college computers ah computer engineering how nice well it's computer engineering technology uh which uh it's all i can understand is just this slightly more hands on version of computer engineering but i've got a ways to go yet so far most of what i've done is getting gotten core classes out of the way taken some electronics classes and one class in um with computer logic how they work is fascinating to me oh yes yeah i rather enjoy it myself the uh lab for that uh um computer logic class was a lot of fun was it did you yeah we got to hook up a few uh counters and and uh decoders encoders hardware stuff huh yeah what do you think of that fuzzy logic i've not gotten a chance to work with it although um my uh my data structures teacher was telling us something about why how fudgy fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it uh-huh now how you'd implement that uh software wise or mechanically i don't know but uh it sounds like a very impressive piece of piece of work yeah they're pretty amazing uh i've written a couple of programs for commercially uh yes and it's a fun field in the fuzzy logic direction what no in uh no just regular uh but you have to take into account you know with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you uh to make your program crash or things you normally don't consider yeah entering bad information of one sort or another and yeah pushing certain keys certain times and yeah messing up your files and things like that uh-huh and your gonna be an engineer a computer engineer type uh yeah well the what the computer well the CET program seems to be so far is just a broad based specialized from you get programming a fair fair amount of programming you get uh hardware you get uh more or less uh you get basic electronics courses that uh deal with you know not only the digital circuitry but uh you know power supplies and and uh just the whole gamut but mostly towards uh computer electronics so the idea is that um you can go in a variety of directions from CET major but i say i have more fun with the hardware than i do with the software so you know i pretty much plan on i mean so far i'm planning to go in the engineering direction i don't that's good uh  what vacations have you been on that you like um well i really enjoyed um i went to Mackinaw Island right a few years back it's in the middle of Lake Michigan and so that was nice i like um driving to a different cities because of the scenery uh-huh so that was nice so you mostly yours is kind of driving and yeah we've i've been all over the states except for pretty much east um it's very pretty driving like um up north in Wisconsin too um how how far uh do you usually end end up driving just um the furthest i drove was probably Texas and then i've taken a train before to California now where you're from where Kenosha Wisconsin oh Wisconsin okay um-hum yeah i have a brother in Minnesota that used to live in Wisconsin oh so yeah that's quite a ways yeah it is i've uh we went to California this last year and uh liked it but it was too crowded Walt Disney World and um-hum oh all those places it's just the wrong time of the year to go oh yeah and uh course uh you get in any of those tourist traps and everything's uh outrageously priced and uh um-hum kind of you wonder if they're it's really worth it to pay uh thirty five dollars or forty dollars just to get in yeah that's true but there's lots of fun places to see um i think the scenery kind of that's something do to you like to get up in mountains or oh yeah um-hum do you have any mountains nearby no it's pretty flat isn't it yeah yeah um i think uh the biggest limitation is a lot just time and money isn't it oh yeah yeah what vacation have you enjoyed the most um probably uh when we go to Wisconsin Dells um it's pretty fun there's a lot to do up there it's pretty busy though you have to like crowds you know i what is it um oh it's uh like a huge amusement park um they have water slides okay uh-huh and it's just a big big tourist attraction there's the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops and it's it's really neat i don't think uh hardly anybody lives there because it's just kind of like you know tourists probably a city in itself kind of like huh yeah it's mostly a a summer summer place summer place how far away is it um from Kenosha it's about three hours huh it's about a hour away from Madison okay sure yeah so that's nice it's it's pretty ride up there too i really like the city Wausau in Wisconsin it's really pretty sure it's nice out there i i like all the nature things there are to look at you know right well and you could probably you're in a climate that's kind of humid so you have probably a lot of green and a lot of real pretty things our our climate's real dry and where is that you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery most of the most most the land's pretty brown you don't have as much of the greenery like you have oh where is that uh Idaho is where i live and uh yes i don't twenty five oh okay it's by uh i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i'm on the phone it's by um Boise you ever heard of Boise and uh it's fun it's nice it's uh oh yeah yeah it's lot different kind of i lived in Indiana for a while and it's a real different uh land and scenery than there it's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity and yeah things like that i think uh there's a lot of places uh oh down even in southern Utah the canyons canyon lands and Bryce Canyon and oh boy they're gorgeous Lake Tahoe oh do that yeah those are kind of fun places we usually go over to Bear Lake in the summer which is uh kind of on the border of Idaho and Utah and the lake goes on forever and that's real pretty over there too oh but i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer yeah i do oh yeah me too uh me too unless i'm going somewhere warm for the winter yeah that'd be nice right right when'd you try and  um what do you feel about child care well fortunately my children are pretty much beyond that mine are too but i think it's a real real a real serious situation for a lot of people it certainly is and i don't you know a lot about it where where you're working for this school department yes um our YMCA has after school child care um at several of the schools so that they don't even have to you know go anywhere yeah leave the school uh-huh um and then for other schools that they don't have it at the school they have it at the Y and they pick them up in a a you know a van or whatever i think it kind of depends on how many um-hum well you're probably in a more uh oh what we we live in a rural rural area students oh okay and so i think most of the people around here that have to leave their children leave them with uh neighbors or people you know in a home situation um-hum um-hum um-hum well that's always nice too i did that when mine were were littler so uh-huh the uh first couple of years that i i worked only halftime when my first child was born and and he just stayed with a friend or somebody that maybe had one child you know his age um-hum um and that always seemed to work out real well and you know when somebody would decide to quit or something i always felt real panicky um-hum but always seemed to manage to find somebody that i thought was just as wonderful as the other one you know so it seemed to work out yeah did you have you worked all the time your children were little um uh when i had my second one i stayed home for three and a half years oh uh-huh and then and then went back so but that's about the time then they could go into a preschool situation right right unfortunately the preschool that i wanted the second one to go to because my first one had oh is a preschool that does not have any day care at all but it's such a wonderful preschool so i had to find somebody else to keep them and then and then somebody to take them there uh-huh oh so that's always another problem oh yes uh you know i don't know how people we it's pretty cold here in Utah in the winter and i think i just think it would be so hard to have to get a child up a baby um um-hum um-hum and take it in the cold to someone early in the morning right yep i think that that i would let i think i would sooner have it in someone in the home taking care of it um-hum but then that's awfully expensive too in a home yeah well i mean if so you have someone come into your home oh yes uh-huh to come into your home but i you know that that would be real nice but just almost almost cost prohibitive prohibitive you know um-hum yes unless you can get could get a a nanny or something that i know a lot of the girls here go off as nannies uh-huh and stay in people's homes and take care of them after they've graduated from high school not a lot but some of them oh uh-huh uh-huh but uh i think that'd be an ideal situation i've never had to to uh work out of the home i've had we had uh six children and they just uh-huh i would just i was just here with them well you just worked period huh if you had six children right and right well there was seventeen years between them but that uh yeah well i just i just really that's what i wanted to do you know and but i know that my uh-huh yeah children's spouses and i have five boys and a girl and uh oh where did the girl come in the middle uh-huh we kept trying but uh the our our daughter or none of them have worked very much while their children have been little middle oh that's good um-hum so but uh we have fourteen grandchildren so this is i i feel lucky that they have not had to go out of the home right right because i i i don't know i just think that those first two or three years and then again in high school they they need their mother there yeah that's true yeah that is true well how cold is it up there so uh it's in the how cold is it honey right now about twenty eight oh okay well it's about fifty here so uh no it's quit yeah it was bad there for a little bit but uh anyway is it still raining oh good are you um-hum what do you do in the school district do you i'm a librarian oh well that's be interesting i love books um-hum yeah i liked that a lot and i kind of wanted to continue it even though my children were you know when they were born but like i said i was able to stay home for so uh-huh those three years so it made a difference well i think if you're trained and i think if you feel it within yourself that you want to be out you know and you you have uh you have the ability and stuff that's great there were times when i would have loved to have got you know uh-huh to left to have left my kids and you know um-hum to get out yeah that's true i think and everybody feels that way at times at least i'm sure they do and then also that you'd love to be home at i'm sure that's so too at other times but uh one thing i think it does do is it it it forces it forces you to make your children be organized and and i think it makes them more independent um-hum and independent that's right that  well let's see if i can recall all those questions um well first off i have one daughter who's two uh-huh and the question i think focused primarily on how people spend time with their children and is it adequate uh-huh i think that's so varied depending on um what what your life is all about you know i i was just about to say priorities but it really has more to do with um the things that influence your life as opposed to just your priorities right i work as well as um spend as much time as i can with my daughter my husband so uh-huh it's always a challenge um i think that probably we like to spend our time together doing um recreational things as much as possible right i mean that's sort of obvious i guess when you have a young child anyway they're not they're not off on their own they're going where you're going right um so we enjoy things like camping and spending time together on weekends and going for walks and bike rides and things like that uh-huh cool i think that's what it's all about that's i the things i remember most when i was growing up were the same that anytime we did something with the family it was boring or something active we rarely went to any movies or and and i'm glad we took that time that we were together to to really spend in communicating and talking with one another and enjoying each other's company uh-huh did you have a lot of siblings i do i have seven brothers and sisters there's eight of us wow so it was a challenge you know to find time especially as we got older um to find time to where we all could could do it but it was also a lot of fun it really uh-huh uh-huh this i think for us it made it that although we didn't spend a whole lot of time together as a complete family well that's probably a challenge considering the age span yeah well there's a huge age span for example my oldest sister is twenty four and my youngest brother is six so yeah oh most the activities we did do together were were sports when one of us played in a sporting event it everyone who was available would go to that or once somebody sang in a choir oh uh-huh well i would imagine at a certain point too you were probably able to care for each other in in like pseudo parent roles so that you had a chance to so I think that's what i remember most yeah yeah and a lot of uh you know that was a big thing i remember when i was growing up that as soon as i could drive my job was to take over mom's car responsibilities and drive everybody all around But that was cool because it gave us a chance to to get to know the other kids and really see how they were like instead of just what they were like at home uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh which was really neat interesting and my little one wants to talk on the telephone right now she sees me talking how old is the little one she's two oh boy keeps you busy i guess pardon me i would guess she keeps you pretty busy yeah yeah it's it's a it's an age of um extremes to some degree very loving and very sensitive and and yet sometimes just so overwhelmed by the emotions that uh hard to keep them in check uh-huh right i can imagine well let's see what else but the question of was it enough you know it think that's a really hard thing for people to answer i think that it depends on each individual uh-huh yeah i agree a hundred percent if you feel as though you're spending enough i mean some people can work full time and feel like they're able to spend enough time with their kids and other people can't imagine how that could be truth yeah and i think it's true i think a lot of times people get caught up on the quantity instead of the quality uh-huh huh and i'd just as spoon soon spend you know thirty minutes with my dad talking and just being with him than i would an hour and a half being at a movie with him uh-huh did you have times when you were um like going on a date or having an opportunity to spend one on one with parents given that there were so many siblings did you have much one to one time um when i was growing up there wasn't a whole lot most of our one on one was was with other brothers and sisters uh-huh um more now than ever i i'm home for school right from school right now just for Christmas and i've probably spent more one on one time with my dad since i've been home than i did in the year when i was here uh-huh uh-huh which was at times that was difficult you know we he made time when we needed it but he's a very very busy person He works his job and a half and he's on the school board and everything so he's he's rarely home uh-huh uh-huh but when he is he makes sure that it's quality time with us and he wants to you we always knew that that he was there for us if we needed him uh-huh that's an important element of a relationship even if it's not always contact yeah and i must have kept your mom busy yeah they they were both run wild there i don't know how they did it really it's pretty amazing when you look on so many families some time back that were larger it's very much the unusual today uh-huh yeah and i think it's interesting too You know i think to me at least to have a big family is something that i personally will want when i get married um-hum um-hum just because i i was able to see the what happens with other siblings you know and be a i had to learn to be responsible real quick being the second oldest uh-huh oh is that right you were second yeah so I got to yeah besides the fact that you really uh learn to function in the social system you know it's the family unit is a is a microcosm absolutely  you say you taught school for a while yes it's been some years ago i haven't taught in the last twenty years oh what grades did you teach i taught about half the time at the high school level and about half the time at the junior college level okay uh and what general subjects um business subjects okay okay do you have children in school uh not yet uh my first son is uh about two months old now um-hum none of them presently going into college um yes do you see anything in particular do you see you feel is wrong about the school system the way it's running now uh well other than the fact that it it's not difficult enough and it doesn't last us long enough during the school year uh i one of the the big errors uh that was made over the years is passing children along when they hadn't really completed the get grade that they were in yeah and allowing children to graduate from high school who couldn't read and write yeah and cipher uh-huh yes oh when i taught at the uh junior college level um i taught uh business law at the sophomore level and we were on the quarter system so they had this was the last two quarters in the sophomore year so they had to um-hum think up something for me to teach at the uh front end of the in the fall yes so i taught a little course called office machines now if you keep in mind this was long before the days of the hand held computer calculator yes so we started off with a ten key adding machine um-hum and uh ah one of the first problems was to add three tenths and twenty four hundredths and invariably a substantial proportion of the class would come up with twenty seven hundredths so i would have to launch into a discussion of common denominator and explain that every figure that was entered into that ten key adding machine with two decimal places um-hum was a number divided by a hundred and in order to add three tenths to anything it had to be changed to thirty hundredths um-hum um-hum and uh the only criterion for getting into the junior college where i taught was being eighteen years of age uh having a high school diploma was not a prerequisite it was for some of the the curricula but it wasn't for the business curriculum yes huh so so that's not not even a GED was required i beg your pardon a GED wan't even required or was that available yet uh no it was not at that time uh to take courses all you had to be with eighteen years of age huh uh so uh the the new math i think ruined our math uh i was teaching at the high school level when it was being introduced to the seventh grade and eighth grade and uh i went to a lecture and the math teacher said well we used to teach business arithmetic at the seventh and eighth grade level but now we're going to teach the new math like how to to count in the binary counting system um-hum and uh uh the base twelve and that sort of thing and uh we're gonna teach the theory of mathematics and never mind percentage um-hum yes so um hm i i checked my my son my son was uh let's see when would he have been in eighth grade about oh in the middle sixties he would have been in the eighth grade and i checked his eighth grade math book so they try to teach a concept and uh there were no percentage there were two pages devoted to percentage and ratio and proportion um-hum and in in his algebra book there were no fractions no percentages and course he proceeded on to geometry and um that sort of thing fortunately my boys have a very high aptitude in math yes but uh there's a a a great population out there that does not and uh so i went through this uh lecture of counting in the decimal counting system and i said if this doesn't make sense to you memorize it and learn your two-doms uh-huh because it's a percentage world out there oh yeah yes  do you take magazines well the only one i get right now is the Journal and i'm really kind of tired of it because it comes out on the newsstand before i ever get it oh so i don't think i'm gonna subscribe to it anymore oh i really enjoy the magazines i take i take several uh or i take two through the church and then i take uh Reader's Digest National Geographic Geographic and Better Homes and Gardens and McCall's so uh-huh and uh hm Redbook oh that's a lot i like Redbook i'm i never would have time to read all those magazines most of the time when i grab one i'm at the airport oh do you travel a lot i do i travel a lot and i just usually will do that you know grab one then and that's about the only time i read them so sometimes i'll pick one up because it looks good and i don't even get to see it so oh oh well i i um uh i work volunteer at the hospital and a lot of times i'll take them in there and go through them and pick out the articles i like and and read them but i really enjoy the magazines i don't i really don't uh-huh yeah read them as much as i would like to but i do like to pick them up and go through them especially if they're National Geographic and Reader's Digest i really enjoy those two yeah well Reader's Digest is always a good magazine it's always great it's got lots of different things in but as far as the articles go i just find we go round and round on the same things an awful lot so i'm just sort of tired of that and yes uh-huh uh-huh oh i don't know well if the only time you read them is at the airport i can see why yeah and i prefer to read a book i really do i like to do that better um-hum well you must be you must have a job then i don't know i'm sorry you must have a you must be employed oh yeah i'm a nurse and and i work float and so i work lots of days and lots of hours and different times and so oh are you oh you don't have time to read then oh you you said you like a book better yeah i do i read books too but i read them at night before i go to bed well i read about one page and then i'm asleep so i don't get very far at night that way and i guess with the holidays and all i haven't even picked up a book or a magazine in about a month but oh uh-huh oh oh we have a son that fies flies for American Airlines he's a oh does he really he's a pilot um-hum we have another son that's a doctor too but anyway i but when i wake up in the night and can't go back to sleep a lot of times i read and my husband has been really good about that ah yeah yeah that's good because i i do enjoy reading a lot but i'm not employed outside of the home either so i so that gives you a little more time to do that yeah i i have an application in with American right now for flight attendant actually so oh that's what i would like to do oh he sure enjoys it yeah well i i was married to someone who worked for American and i miss having my flight privileges boy we would too because we've got kids all over the world uh-huh and and it's just really you know i've got friends all over the world so if i ever want to see them again i need to get me a job at the airlines and um-hum um-hum i've always wanted to fly so with my nursing background i'm hoping that i will be able to um-hum so we'll see but American is the best so trying to hold out for that oh he sure thinks he sure thinks so i saw by the paper today that they're going to lay off a thousand two hundred people though but it's mostly going to be ground crew so oh really yeah and my son is a pilot too so he'll be okay i he'll be okay yeah yeah i've heard that they were expecting some layoffs but yes uh-huh uh-huh i don't know oh don't you have time to read when you are at work no never no i don't even have time to go to lunch it's busy huh oh we grab lunch on the floor we bring our lunch and we spend ten minutes where we can and we're busy most all the time there are days when you know we can kick back but then we sort of visit oh uh-huh which hospital are you at yeah that kind of thing so i'm at Presbyterian in Dallas oh our grandson just had open heart surgery but i'm not sure which hospital probably Children's Medical i imagine so um-hum yeah yeah how did he do real well real well yeah he that's good yeah well i float i go to different hospitals i work for agencies besides Presbyterian so it it stays pretty interesting that way oh uh-huh different places at different times um-hum oh but i keep learning then oh well the Journal is one of my the Ladies' Home Journal is that what you're referring to uh-huh right that's one of my very favorite magazines it's always been one of my favorites and i first turn to Can this Marriage be Saved i love that column and oh yes me too uh-huh that's uh-huh and it's always been one of my favorites but i've just noticed that by the time i get it i would like to have bought it someplace oh  will i return anything well really the only things that i have returned have not been faulty it's been because of the size or right some problem like that i really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to most the time they have a pretty good guarantee uh only thing i've had lately is uh my kids got all these Barbie kind of toys for uh Christmas and uh it it takes them less than a day and they're broken in one way or another but i don't know if that's just kids or if that's uh maybe those type of parts should should be for older kids um-hum what age are your children i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them um-hum and uh i don't think they're unduly rough but maybe they are i don't know but uh a lot of the little Barbie sets they come with real little pieces i and they're easily lost and easily broken but um-hum well my daughter is twenty one now so it's been a while since we've had Barbie things but you know it's been a while since they've uh gone through the Barbie stage doll stage huh but we did have Barbies we did have Barbies and things and there seems to me that that became a craze when she was already oh like you know third fourth fifth grade right so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it but uh i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff don't remember her breaking the no i don't but i also don't remember lots of little pieces they've got so many different things with it now right well that's one thing they've got they've got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with oh like little tiny tiny little plates and little sunglasses and uh my three and a half year old has wanted this goodness Ken doll and so i finally got her a Ken doll and uh less than a week later the arm was broken oh dear but they were real good about replacing it that's one nice thing is they're real good about replacing it well uh i guess if they'll replace them then they assume they shouldn't have broken right well the the you know those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way and she's not that strong that i would any direction um um-hum she's not that big of a girl that i think could really take a grip on it like a bigger kid could you know right yeah the main thing that they've they had when my daughter was playing with Barbies was just clothes you know that was about it yes that was about it and the Barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable um-hum and that kind of stuff but and the main thing my kids are seem to be into nowadays are electronics my my children are twenty one and twenty five and twenty eight oh is that right well do you see that there's a little big problem with electronic things um-hum and so no not really we uh haven't had that much you know problem with things that we have bought they seem to to last in fact when they offer us extended warranties we we don't buy them because we've don't buy them because you don't need them we don't we find we don't need them and uh it seems like it's just a an added tack on plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee yes if you purchase on your credit card you know then they extended put an extended warranty on it if it doesn't work and and uh or if you have a problem with it in a certain period of time so it seems like it's a waste of money oh yes that's the way yes well you almost assume if you're gonna have problems with it it's usually before before that warranty would expire any the first one um-hum and like i've even bought on a recliner once i bought you know a a an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that and i never used it you never never even needed it and so they it seems ridiculous and like washers and dryers and things like that i've never had one go out in fact they usually when they do go out it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix and we don't even have a repairman come or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing um-hum it's time to replace it yes i i think these extended warranties are gimmicks really so i mean they're i do too a lot of it we bought when we first married we bought one on our TV and that there was it was a five year after the first five years and that was ridiculous um-hum and they charge you a pretty good price for them too yes they're a pretty healthy price and you're trying to think oh maybe i'll need this you never you always think gosh if i say no then i won't you know um-hum but well my husband finally just put his foot down and he said we're not gonna buy any of these anymore and if it goes out well you know i don't know if you probably got your time worth out of it anyway um-hum and uh so uh we really have been fairly happy with with things but now we take good care of things and we don't um run out and buy a lot of of things either and since our kids aren't little anymore i'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken yes the little well you probably are real careful of the brands you buy and the when you do buy things you probably watch what kind of type of quality yes well you look at the consumer guide and uh you go around and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the  okay okay um well i basically listen to um all kinds of music like what um even you know from easy listening you know i just find that so relaxing um you know i like fall asleep to that um right i listen to uh i listen to rock the only thing the only thing i don't like um is um hard rock do you like you don't like um my boyfriend listens to Guns and Roses i don't like that either hm no uh-huh and i just you know i just can't um grasp that you know i just don't understand why he likes that um well i listen to the lyrics and i don't know you don't wanna do that they're vulgar yeah and you and you right you listen to the lyrics and un and and uh he even went to their concert and i'm like uh i don't know this person he um did he go to the concert where they gave them about fifteen minutes and then left one with very they were like an hour and a half late coming no no they yeah they made them they made them wait forever and yeah yeah yeah that was a real rip i have a fifteen year old daughter and uh she has kind of mellowed over the years and so now she's liking country but there was a while there where she liked um-hum Poison and Motley Crue and Guns and Roses you know that to me that just scares me uh because he's he's not really like that i mean he doesn't you know he uh well no you know he's not wild or anything but i just i don't know well i like all kinds too i can kind of you know when my daughter was into that i kind of listened to what she wanted to listen to and said well this isn't too bad because she never got into the the really oh well you're a you're a pretty cool mom then my mom would've would've never gone for that but i sing in a choir at church and i like you know that kind of thing even more um-hum my mom would've probably ripped the radio off the no that won't that not what one needs to do either i mean you'll find a mess on your hands out of the stereo if i'd have turned that on um-hum but i i like i have season tickets to the opera hang on just a minute okay oh okay i have season tickets to the opera and i love that and i have season tickets to the summer musicals and i love that so i have what what is that the summer musicals i've heard of it but i don't i'm not the Dallas summer musicals down at State the State Fair music hall down at Fair Park um uh-huh musicals like uh well sometimes you go back to the old Rodgers and Hammerstein's of Oklahoma and Carousel Carousel uh South Pacific you know it's like theater in singing um-hum um-hum um what what um what um what year was all that popular oh dear it still is every summer they have they have about six shows is it was it in the sixties that it was that it that uh Hammerstein what did you say Hammerstein what Rodgers and Hammerstein oh dear they really was very very popular mainly in the fifties um uh-huh fifties your main people now are Sondheim and uh Andrew Lloyd Webber with Phantom of the Opera and Starlight Express Cats um and it's really become quite sophisticated this summer they had Grease and they had the Buddy Holly Story um-hum um and some really good stuff so i like a real variety of well musical so it was just concerts or did they did they like oh they acted out the scene and oh oh no they're stories they're like a play oh yeah they're like a they're like a play only most of it's sung um-hum and they're they're wonderful they're just wonderful there's a lot of dance to them um-hum wonderful sets and costumes just really good Les Miserables is a wonderful one it's based on uh Victor Hugo's Les Miserables which takes place in France during it's not really during the French Revolution it's pre French revolutionary days but talks about you know the poor people and them rebelling and the the music is just unbelievable it's just almost operatic in style it's really wonderful it it's very different but very wonderful ooh good stuff sounds really different you know from what we've got do you listen to country yep Garth Brooks and Reba McIntire really i'm a i'm a Clint Black fan how about George Strait i don't yeah he's okay he's he's okay and and who else Dolly Parton um she's okay and um i don't watch tremendous amount but some um-hum have you gone to um Garth's concert no my kids have but i haven't i heard his concert was did they did they tell you that he swung from a rope like Tarzan like Tarzan he he he swung through the audience like no oh how funny on a yeah i think that's true i somehow or another i wonder if his hat fell off yeah so what else do you listen to oh what else i like Cher she's an old you know she's kind of old singer she's been around a while yeah yeah yeah but she thinks she's young she looks do you ever watch Jim  okay i'm definitely for drug random drug drug testing and any kind of drug testing to try hm and get rid of it hm but don't you don't you find that that sort of imposes imposes a um i mean it it i i taking away people's free agency pretty yes i think so i mean i how many times do you think drug people have taken away people's free agency well not probably not as often as as as you'd like to think and and when you when you take and i i mean it's like would you like to have somebody would you like to have the police able to come to your house and search for for let's say weapons uh twice a day without telling you um would you like to have them come and find and look maybe for uh oh uh illegal illegal books and and could they come and and and just knock on the door and walk in your house and say i want i wanna find illegal books no but as long as you are working for somebody you are yeah well more or less under their jurisdiction um-hum okay well would would you the place at work would you like them to be able to search your purse and and then every time anytime they wanted to just come and and check to see if you had anything that was maybe against the company i i i'm it's not that i'm in favor of of you know that i think people should be allowed to take drugs at the job or or you know anything like that of course but on the other hand it it's it seems a little bit nasty to me just to have this uh um you know it seems quite an imposition on on personal freedom to have um you know it the the the vast majority of people that are at work aren't aren't taking drugs and have nothing to do with them and yet they're being subjected to the to the same kinds of of imposition that everybody else is and and i think i think that that's just unfair if you put it in a different context you see the same either the same you know it it get becomes a little clearer of course you know i'm my assumption is that that you don't take drugs and and and you of course would never have have nothing to hide in that sense and so it that doesn't doesn't hit home very close right but when it's something else it it does hit home and and right i've you know it ah it it gets more like a police state um and it's a lot less like America to me and and i find that uh i find it pretty offensive to have you know to have to be subjected you know i mean to to subject everybody to that kind of of of uh how you know random search it wouldn't bother me and i don't think it would bother any of my family i have a son that's a doctor and i have a son that's an airline pilot and yeah uh and i think they're they are among the top ones that should be subject to to that yeah yeah uh you know and and again again you know in my case i have nothing to hide and i'm not gonna you know it's not gonna hurt me but on the other hand i'm very uh it it perturbs me to have the this issue uh one of our freedoms so called yeah i mean just to to to be able to walk in and say you know now you have to show us this or you have to do that or you have to and taken away um it it seems it it seems like it's an erosion of of of a lot of what makes uh the the United States what it is and and i i i strongly dislike that um and so well i'm for doing it because i think that it is a protection against the majority of the of the citizens yeah now actually actually i i don't take a a totally strong position on it i mean i think that i think there are certain certain positions you're just trying to argue with me to show another point no no no i i think that there are there are certain positions where the the benefits of it outweigh the the the disadvantages of it and and like you say you know maybe airline pilots or or um you know people who who whether i have a son that's a doctor what about him uh-huh yeah i i suppose you know i i i kind of wonder about sort of random testing in general i i guess random testing is a way to make people not not feel like they're being singled out right right because you know it seems like that that um you ought to be able to tell who who has a problem and and uh and be able to deal with them um but but i suppose that has uh some uh some negative side effects too right i mean people still maybe they would feel like they were being persecuted or something right um and uh and i supposed that the random testing and i guess the logic is that if as long as um-hum um-hum you know if if if you're not involved then you don't have a problem with it it shouldn't it shouldn't be any an issue for you and and and eventually the people that are actually doing that and causing the problems will be will be caught at it but um i don't know i just really feel strongly against drugs because i think that they're they're tearing our nation apart they're tearing families apart they're tearing um-hum um-hum good people that you know uh could would be asset a asset to the community and to the nation and i just think that drugs is um yeah i just try so hard i would try so hard to get them out of wherever they were yeah i i you know it's it's sort of like you know i i i don't i just disagree with your position in general it's it's just that it's kind of  um what sort of camping do you like to do the most uh well i i do uh real rough type camping i have a motor home huh rough type huh okay yeah uh oh yeah motor homes can be a lot of fun yeah they really are they really are i've i've enjoyed it i've never actually done any uh like tent camping but uh one of these days i'm gonna try that too yeah uh that can be a lot of fun too yeah like to go to visit to the national parks and state parks and and uh just get out and see nature yeah how about you well so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping uh-huh this summer we went to uh the Smokey Mountain National Park oh how great and uh stayed about three or four days in there it was wonderful nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable and the the days were nice and warm and it was beautiful beautiful few days oh yeah um uh-huh that's great it worked out particularly well especially considering she was what six months pregnant uh-huh so i don't know it worked pretty well it was one of those uh those dome type pop up tents um-hum um-hum nice and quick and easy to put up and yeah packs away nice and small yeah about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto well that's true that's true it was a lot of fun yeah i guess the last real uh camping trip i took was has been a couple years ago yeah uh i went to California and up to the Sequoias ah that's got to be beautiful territory yeah it's gorgeous i love the big trees just just the drive up through um up the coast line and then cut over in into the into the parks it's gorgeous though yeah what like Sequoia National Park yeah uh um-hum um-hum yeah i had been there before when i lived in California that's my first trip back in oh goodness hm hm thirty years maybe but yeah that is God's country it has to be yeah yep do they still have the uh the scenic uh roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees uh no no they don't that and the last one um and well the first time i was there the the tree was still standing but it has since come down oh okay yeah but they are huge if you've never seen them it's it's very awe inspiring no so far New Orleans is far west as i've gotten um-hum yeah well New Orleans and uh Minneapolis um-hum well there's lots of pretty country further west oh yeah we're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way yeah yeah yeah and needed need to take the little one oh yeah show them all the all the pretties before they go away yeah they seem to be trailing out quickly yeah yeah because of there there's lots to see there's of course the the Grand Canyon and uh the Painted Desert is is real pretty in a in a different sort of way yes and course the the Sequoias and the Redwoods and and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone and uh the Grand Tetons are gorgeous too i imagine yeah course i'm i guess i'm partial to big tree country i would imagine they are yeah i don't know why i got stuck down here in Texas i think it's called a job i don't know uh not a whole lot of forestry down there is there no not around here not around here hm oh the place is forested with concrete with those concrete trees um-hum lot lot of concrete and glass you know hm yeah well i guess that's God's place too anyway yeah um what do you figure has been the longest trip you've taken camping uh probably the the last one that i went to California i took uh three weeks three weeks so i was actually yeah on the road a little more than three weeks yeah the whole family in with in on this um-hum everybody yeah yep that would have to be a blast yeah it really was it was great what well you went out from Texas up in into that area um-hum yeah we went uh we took the southern route and went went through uh uh the Grand Canyon again and we stopped at uh um Las Vegas for a couple of nights and then uh went into Malibu in California over on the coast and then went up the the Big Sur Highway all the way up to San Francisco yeah and uh couldn't even cut across through the wine country and went down to the to uh Sequoia National Park okay oh wow okay Big Sur Highway that's uh well you're pretty much in view of the ocean almost all the time aren't you oh yeah uh-huh you really are  um the one that i'm most familiar with are the Utah Jazz i guess that's because they they're Utah Jazz what are they called Jazz oh never heard of them uh-huh the Jazz right and they're a fairly new ball team as far as ball teams go um oh they probably oh it's probably five to ten years that they've they've been you know in existence and but they've done really fairly well for for a new team they i think out of the last like eleven games they've won won nine which is pretty good because a lot of them were on you know on the road and um oh yeah i think as far as whichever division they're in they're rated either number one or number two so that's yeah that's fairly good and how about uh-huh well that's good yeah well maybe we'll hear of them more often yeah and how about yourself well i guess what we have here is the Mavericks is that right basketball what is oh what is our Dallas basketball i'm not really sure the Dallas Mavericks i that one is soccer one is basketball the Mavericks must be basketball oh oh and uh my daughter plays basketball you wouldn't know it would you from this conversation i'm familiar with the Teddy Bears and they're my favorite oh well well tell me about yeah tell me about her team how old is she well now she's twelve so she but she's been playing basketball for four or five years on a little team called Teddy Bears and oh oh has she well how fun that's been fun so now she just made her middle school team so that's well great and they've won so far that's good but uh she must really enjoy it yes she likes it a lot yeah she really does and the Lakers i guess is my favorite as far as well good as anything i know about basketball yeah because i my boyfriend's in California so as professionals professional basketball teams oh uh-huh i'm gonna have to look at Lakers this year a lot so i guess i'll get used to it i learned a lot about football so have to at least oh uh-huh well does a now was was your daughter just interested in basketball or why did she start playing uh i guess because her friends signed up oh and she wanted to sign up she twirls and she's she's been real real involved in that so we haven't had time for soccer uh-huh oh which is the most important thing around here pretty i mean all the little kids play soccer oh is it oh they even have like a preschool soccer team my word it's big in Texas and i maybe all over now i don't know but oh wow uh it's very big here but we didn't have that time uh-huh and so i did let her play basketball and i like it because it's indoors oh yeah yeah i like indoor things so yeah right well that's good if she made her middle school team she must be fairly fairly proficient yeah well she's pretty fast she's not real big but she's real fast and so um uh-huh oh oh well yeah it's hard to just for me to picture these little ones that basketball is pretty big to be thrown yeah you know up that that high yeah but oh in the beginning you know they couldn't even make the basket and they were allowed to stand halfway forward to take that take solid shots and they couldn't even get the ball that high because they were so little and not strong enough uh-huh oh right uh-huh and then uh her last game just before the whistle blew they had two seconds left oh she threw the ball from center court and it went right into the basket oh wow well great oh that's great now do so she was the hero after all those years of trying to get that ball up in that basket so and so that was pretty fun to see the improvement and her coach was behind us in the bleachers but uh-huh from the other team and he said Christmas came early this year so yeah well how fun now do you have any boys that play or no my son never played uh basketball he's he's grown and he he's in the band and he swam some how old is he uh-huh mostly he was a student so oh he was he was he was in yeah he's a national merit student and he speaks five languages and all that so he wasn't much into sports he did play baseball for a while and he liked that great oh great uh-huh oh but um he didn't he didn't play basketball at all well that's fun have you ever played basketball i did i played basketball in high school i loved it that and volleyball that is i've just played it for fun i've never done anything you know organized or on a a school team or anything but i think it's a real fun game uh-huh yeah i love it i think it's my favorite and it's my favorite to watch um-hum and when i was in high school i was a twirler and so oh i always enjoyed that and cheerleading you know we got to do it indoors oh uh-huh right so i always liked the basketball games better than the football games because you weren't out in the cold so right well it seems like i don't know basketball maybe i don't know that much but it doesn't seem like basketball's that aggressive compared to football and well yeah and it's easier to follow right if the ball goes in they get two points football everybody falls on top of each other and it's real difficult to say um-hum who right right that's exactly what went wrong you know for me anyway so  uh well uh the Cowboys are my favorite team that's pretty easy to say nowadays lot easier than it was a couple years ago but they had a big win today uh did you get to watch it no i didn't i uh have been at my computer all day so oh are you a Cowboy fan well i used to be a real big Cowboy's fan and and uh i'm not at Jimmy Johnson's fan being an Okie right yeah i just really don't care much uh it's it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan though uh-huh they've always been you know my favorite right but uh and and i guess i still have a soft spot i just hate that that's the coach that's leading them so now have they they're in the play-offs right yet right right yeah they made it to the play-offs finally like just you know two years ago they were one and fifteen they won like just one game and so it's a pretty fast turn around but this year they made it to play-offs and today was their first game and they beat the Chicago Bears so everybody's really going crazy you know down here i'll bet they are they're going crazy so so they turned it around but yeah they have a lot of young exciting players now up i mean everybody was real upset you know when they fired Tom Landry but you know now it's like you know they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that uh at football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world uh-huh hit a bad season and it's you know the coach's fault let's let's dump him right first good season the coach can do no wrong right but they've Dallas has always been good ahead you know heading good players and and both running exactly you know um-hum running backs and and defense right yeah uh you know they have a young team it's you know a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old you know players every year and you know same coach same everything so now it's you know like a taste of something different they're all not you know mister nice guys like they used to be now it's like you know tough and dirty team so everybody is really excited and who's their competition gonna be well it's supposed to be the Redskins but you know we beat them already we beat them this year in in Washington so you know so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl but you know it's just that we have to play every game away you know it's gonna be tough but but every their competition is are teams that they've already beat this year so i mean Atlanta they're in it too and we beat them and uh see Detroit we play them next week but you know we should beat them everybody feels like we should be able to beat them so it's so everything is uh looking real good course i think you know you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season um-hum because teams jell together or they've had injuries that heal and you know it can be a totally or injuries that uh have newly happened right right right and it could be almost a totally new team out there than the one you played yeah well the Cowboys are on a roll they've won like i think six or seven in a row now so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the in the league going into the play-offs so well well since you have a OU uh drop out as a quarterback uh right yeah Troy Aikman he got hurt at OU so he transferred to UCLA well he he really didn't feel like he'd be able to do a lot of passing at OU right OU's always been known for their running game more than um-hum they're playing tonight in fact i'm watching them on TV right now right but they're doing some stomping on Virginia oh i tell you they've they've not had much of a team this year bless their little hearts really well they're doing good tonight are they i haven't been watching yeah they're winning they're winning forty one to seven well good for us oh yeah right but yeah and uh that's right Aikman did go to OU i forgot about that yep they had then he went out to let's see Southern Cal is that where you went yeah uh UCLA yeah yeah so but the Cowboys did good today i mean i was proud i thought i thought they would get beat today because i mean they're so young you know play-offs  uh are you presently looking uh for a used used car well as a matter of fact i just bought one just just within the last three weeks just bought one so what'd you get i got a Lexus LS four hundred Lexus um which is made by Toyota okay Lexus is a Toyota sub brand yeah okay i was wondering where that came from because they're talking like it was an American built car it's kind of their right it it sounds like it but it really isn't it's uh marketed of course it its own dealerships yeah yeah usually usually or somebody that's maybe got a Cadillac or Lincoln and Lexus dealership uh sometimes they do that but yeah yeah it's uh a brand car but i've really liked it it it drives just wonderfully and there is it's so quiet you almost can't tell the engine is running that's their big selling point uh other than general luxury and and but the particular seems to be the uh the quiet ride it seems they it's it really is it's got pretty good acceleration too it's got a CD player in it so i can i can play those and yeah uh was that wasn't a standard feature was it hum-um okay but there's not very many options on that car uh i get the impression there's only about five or six options everything else is standard uh some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north the CD and the premium sound system yeah you get the impression that's um-hum yeah skidding control you mean the antilock brake system yeah it's kind of a traction control i think they call it it's it's not just antilock brake i think that's already on most of them but there's a further traction control uh yeah oh this is a uh uh probably suspension tied into the brakes yeah and and also the suspension can be raised for driving like in the ice and snow it can raise the car's center up a little bit oh yeah for going under a lot of piled up stuff if you were up in Michigan or somewhere yeah uh shoot some of these muddy driveways use it around here Mississippi probably doesn't Mississippi probably doesn't have to worry too much about that no snow doesn't happen very often if it does people go what's this stuff yeah uh originally i'm from West Virginia we got a pretty fair amount of snow but uh i got down here in June of eighty four oh well you had some there yeah and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane manly adult men into playful little children oh i know we had this group of uh surveyors come into uh a shop i was working in um four or five of them these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked but while they were there they set back drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles threw snowballs all over the place oh no had themselves a ball for about an hour well the uh the Lexus uh really and the moon roof i think is also an option although most of them are ordered them with it but there really is only about a half a dozen uh things and yeah yeah everything else is pretty standard i did not get the traction control which also when you take the control traction control and the and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats too oh so that's kind of you go out and get in that real cold car and you turn that on and it yeah and it kind of uh but that's only available if with the traction control and the other option and those two are sold together so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to it's a package deal yeah ouch to uh do it so i i opted not for that but no it doesn't sound real necessary in Texas and uh the dealership i dealt with they order them all with the uh moon roof and uh you know nice floor mats and everything in there yeah yeah i worked for Lincoln so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a CD or not in the stereo system and that was pretty much it and they had like three or four basic packages that they yeah sounds like the Lincoln Mercury dealer i used to work for they didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got little Mercury Tracer they offer yeah i've been over i've been imagine or not they make a they make a luxury Mercury Tracer yeah i've seen that in the dealership i was driving a Lincoln a Mark Seven for the last four years before i traded it for this and uh yes i'm leasing the Lexus i usually lease them since i own a business i just run it through my business but yeah um-hum but it the Lincoln ride is certainly good too but the this Lexus is nothing like i have ever been in before it just like sitting in your living room yeah it really is and it's got a lumbar support in the seats adjustable uh power and just kind of brings that support up in the small adjustable yeah  why don't you tell me about the Brewers well uh i guess the thing about the Brewers is i think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately um i think that's their main problem uh they seem to have have stuck with the same core of players uh Robin Yount Paul Molitor and Jim Gantner who uh they're real good players but they seem to just depend on them to produce a pennant and it it doesn't it isn't working well the problem with the Rangers is they've got a lot of offense they just don't have any pitching and really haven't had any pitching for years they're the top offensive team around but defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul except for papa Ryan anyway well that's true but he only comes every five times so yeah that's right he can't win them all for him he can't win them all and he's getting a little bit up there yeah i think uh the thing about the Brewers is too their pitching they never have really had real good pitching uh last time they had really good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the World Series was with uh people like Vuckovich and Fingers oh yes Rollie Fingers yeah yeah and of course uh he got them to the Series but then just before the Series that year in eighty two he um uh threw his elbow out or something shoulder or elbow i can't remember which and uh they're number two right-hander in the bullpen Pete Ladd who was kind of a rookie that year uh had to take his place and uh i think that's why they lost the series because in in game two in Saint Louis they had a pretty good lead going into late innings and Ladd got rattled when he didn't get some calls and they ended up losing the game uh Ole Mustache Fingers would not have done that well Rollie was Rollie was more uh well i guess he's uh is he in the Hall of Fame already i don't even remember i can't remember if he's made it or not yet he he may not have been i don't know when he retired actually you got to be retired for five years to be eligible yeah but that was i think eighty two was well eighty one was the year i think that he won the the uh Cy Young and the MVP and the Fireman of the Year Award all at the same time i think but uh but in eighty two i think he won something some kind of award had a lot of saves anyway yeah we had a game here where uh we had Goose Gossage this year and Goose and uh Ryan combine and they got i don't know Ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time Goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that well i'd forgotten that Gossage was with the Rangers the the he was this year last year yeah but he's not coming back now did they pick him up uh sometime in the middle of the season or what well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the manager and manager Bobby Valentine didn't come along so yeah Goose is Goose is history yeah well he's been quite a reliever in his time oh yeah he's a he's he's definitely headed to the Hall of Fame But the Rangers have you know a a pretty good lineup now um with the with the addition of the uh Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people there's just nobody there yeah well we'll be looking for them to uh to improve in that area i guess because at least the uh now that i think about them a little bit i'm getting sort of back through the football season back into baseball i realize when you think of the Rangers now you got a real good looking young outfield there for the most part and uh quite a few of the infielders are uh probably have good real good careers still ahead of them i'm not sure why they got rid of Buechele but i guess it worked out for him okay well at least he got to play in a championship the Rangers have never won the division so we're we're obviously not going to last year yeah oh Inky went the wrong way though didn't he yeah i think he's history he is history now who did they trade him to i forgot Cleveland Detroit Detroit well they didn't yeah they he went to Detroit they really didn't get much for him oh oh they released him really didn't they yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody yeah but he proved to be a total disaster my goodness when he was when he was when he could really get into a ball though he was uh had a lot of power i tell you he reminds me a lot of Gorman Thomas remember him yeah center fielder for the Brewers there for a while there was a guy that yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field uh well i don't think his fielding was generally that bad he uh as a matter of fact he was to it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning yeah right yeah he did get better and i think uh he was one of George Bamburger's big projects when he took over at the Brewers at Milwaukee he was the guy that was up and down uh  yes do you rely on newspapers or TV or what for your current events well uh mostly the radio i listen to the radio i'm home during the day and so i have the radio going and listen to the news there and then uh i watch the news on TV at night we have a local newspaper that we subscribe to but that's um all the newspaper my husband and i used to take the the Wall Street Journal and that had a lot of good information are you in Salt Lake City we're fifty miles north so you're a suburb of it then right right so we don't take the Salt Lake newspaper how about okay we have we have in Dallas what's called talk radio oh yes and it's news twenty four hours a day uh-huh you don't listen to it twenty four hours if you're in the car for twenty minutes in traffic you sure get a bunch of news real quick get caught up on it fast so you primarily rely on on the radio right right yes and we have um the station we listen to is out of Kansas or out of Salt Lake City and it's an all news or an all talk station also it doesn't have the right the music and thing so do you have where these people call in express their opinions and talk back yes yeah yeah same thing down here it's uh really gets some really neat information that way don't we uh right get a lot of different different viewpoints have you i definitely take the morning newspaper and read the headlines of every morning and uh uh-huh and that helps keep up on too how about magazines do you take any magazines i at the office nothing newsworthy uh uh National Geographic Reader's Digest oh oh uh i'm afraid we're probably reliant on newspapers and radio right that television news i'm not interested in their in them right that you don't like the television news the television reports uh no i don't uh especially in depth things like 60 Minutes but oh uh-huh or or whatever else they call i think they're very biased they are right presents one viewpoint and not the other uh uh journalistic uh they'll go into some guy's office with TV cameras rolling and uh-huh because he sticks up his hand doesn't want to be seen he's considered he's supposed to be considered guilty uh-huh they're charging they're making a man look guilty before he's even given a chance to hear his side of the story but well you know i think there's a lot of that in the newspaper reporting too i because a lot and i don't know how much of what we read is is really accurate a few of the stories that definitely that you know i've been personably person known what's going on and then you read what's in the newspaper about it and it doesn't always match up so you really wonder what you hear from this Russia thing that going on is is Yeltsin all that great you know is he really going to um-hum it sounds as more and more came out that he and what's his name is gone now um-hum Gorbachev yeah Gorbachev Gorbachev got into a political quarrel about three years ago and uh oh Gorbachev just got beat to the punch politically oh and i mean even with a guy Gorbachev goes to his office to clean out his desk for the next day and Yeltsin is already there sitting there uh-huh oh that's ugly uh it is and and like you say we really i'm really not sure how much of what we hear is reliable um-hum we uh my family and i went out we have a golden spike um railroad monument oh it's probably about fifty miles from here and um-hum last Friday we went out there to watch the train come in the steam engine and there was uh there was a probably a group of oh maybe fifty to seventy five people out there and the newspaper reporter was there and he took a picture and it was in the paper the next day and it hundreds well just the opposite they probably had oh ten people in the picture and he said um just a small group had turned out to watch the steam engine come in and the way it was printed and the way the picture was it looked like that was all there was was right there when there was i'll be dad gummed quite quite a few more there you know so um i think you have to be careful when when we take in the information what we take as truth and what we don't we lost the second major newspaper in Dallas within this month oh i read that the Dallas Times Herald went under we were one of the few yes few cities remaining big cities that had two papers uh-huh and and we're sorry now you got the Fort Worth Press and uh uh no Fort Worth Star Telegram The Press went years ago and the Dallas Mourning News and oh oh was it financial trouble that's what they went under for wasn't it yep yep competition killed them and and then well the Morning News finally bought out the the Herald oh oh yes oh well that's that's too bad which one did did you subscribe to that one of course closed it down but oh i've been with the Dallas Morning News for twenty years oh ah it is the conservative paper and i'm probably lean to being conservative as opposed to liberal so and the other was kind of the liberal paper so uh-huh uh-huh oh oh huh well that so i feel sorry for all the liberals in town they have to read the good stuff now oh yes well that's i think Tom and i think um the children  hi so what well what do you think well providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task and i uh personally i don't approve of it for two reasons number one is that i think that uh the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now and if they were to administer this they would uh get us more and more into debt further than we can ever get out ourselves number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would would be dried up and really no one would be would only answer to to the government to a big bureaucratic bureaucratic mess and uh i've seen what it has done in other countries and so i don't think uh i don't think we should head in that direction although that we have problems right now and i do agree that they exist because health care insurance for for everyone is skyrocketing and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore um-hum how do you feel about the whole whole ordeal well i agree that it's a big task but i think that i think that the US should move towards some kind of national health care plan at least as a long term kind of goal um-hum you know possibly you know just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing but i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to um and not have a completely socialized medical system in the country but maybe something about halfway between that and what we have now uh-huh okay it um just because it seems that um health insurance costs are sky rocketing well as fast as the national deficit oh yes perhaps and so that's and that's a that's a vicious cycle of course but what what you're think yeah so what you're saying though is instead of having the national government government administer because giving health insurance to every man woman and child with throughout the whole company you see more of them as regulating the high costs uh that people are forced to pay for it right now is that is that correct or do you think that um well i um well i wouldn't exclude the possibility of the government actually administrating it ultimately i don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea and um well with the with the costs as they are right now do you think that the government uh because what that would require is for us to pay uh more taxes and the the income the people that can afford taxes the middle income and the upper income will be paying more cash taxes to to pay for health insurance for everyone whereas right now the the public themselves right get health insurance and they provide their own health insurance the well as it is now the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance and so that the other people have no health insurance and you know they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies and somebody winds up paying for that and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance so i do not see that anything this situation would get any worse that way it might get better you think it might be get better huh i i kind of disagree the reason being is uh um-hum we have i don't know i guess it's my my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic um-hum rules that it would take to administer it and um the the health insurance companies right now pretty much regulate and are pretty picky and and uh don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business whereas the federal government if they took over everything they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business people would still have to pay taxes the money would have to come from somewhere and so you'd see i i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also but in the same sense the the care and the the attitude of the doctors and the professionals within the medical uh field would would diminish um-hum um i yeah well i think  okay uh do you have children no have uh are you a grandparent or you just have never had children i've never had any children oh oh well this is kind of hard topic for you then isn't it that's all right i'm opinionated you're what i'm opinionated oh oh okay we're we're grandparents now and uh we did spend a lot of time with our children they were we had five boys and one girl uh-huh um-hum and they were all into Little League and and athletics and fact we had two two state wrestling champions wow and uh then we had uh they were in Little League they were in uh Cub Scouts and uh they were just busy and we just spent time with them i mean with five boys you're just following one or the other all the time um-hum five uh-huh wow and one girl uh-huh well you had to have something to even it out there you what had to have something to even it out yeah we had a basketball team and this cheerleader right but um we and then we went camping with them and everything and uh we enjoy our uh enjoyed our children they're scattered all over the world right now we have two in Germany one in Dallas i was going to say that's a Black Forest cuckoo clock you have yeah i can tell by the sound right right and then we have uh one in Chicago he's an airline pilot and then one in Chicago Cleveland that's a doctor airline pilot for what airline pardon what airline American really uh-huh do you do you are you connected with American my dad flies American he's retiring in April oh my goodness yeah well how long has he flown for them oh twenty some odd years oh oh twenty four twenty three something like that well our our son's been with them about eight i would maybe not six maybe six but he's a captain now so we're happy with that well uh he'll he'll enjoy the the freedom that that kind of a job gives you course he does he says and to think they even pay me for it yeah that's what my dad says you know as soon as he is retired he's gonna you know hire some hire an airplane uh-huh because he really likes to fly yeah well our son that's a doctor uh has his pilot's license too but just it's a small craft huh well huh but uh how old are you may i ask i'm thirty seven oh and you don't have children do you uh we can't oh we tried but it's just not gonna happen well sometimes that happens and sometimes uh you fill your life with other things so well we have animals and we have uh chickens and dogs and cats and birds oh do you do you live on a little farm then yeah we have a little you know just about ten acres out here out you know about ninety miles north and uh west of Dallas oh so it it's stop it's it's a lot of fun i'm building our house right now oh that oh my goodness you must be talented well i was a you know contractor for past fifteen years oh doing uh anything from you know bagging concrete for a pad or uh you know i did uh couple of complete remakes of a house you know tore down and started over almost on one of them oh uh-huh yeah my uh specialty is in restoration restoration uh-huh and uh oh i figured well i'll build myself a house you know and i'm doing it now as a matter of fact i just got out of the shower oh oh your wife answered the phone that's why oh well we're just watching the BYU football game at the Holiday Bowl you probably don't follow that no not not that close hey don't televise that down here oh it's on ESPN well we don't take cable i mean it would cost a fortune oh uh-huh oh see we're they just put the phone in four years ago well oh my goodness you know there was no phone service for ten miles oh you're really rural yeah we are crazy as they say yeah well we we're about sixty miles north of Salt Lake City so have you ever been there um i went to Salt Lake once oh and i was very i guess we were seven or eight oh but uh well we better get back to the subject did um oh yeah raising kids uh-huh i think the first thing you got to do is unplug your TV set and give it to the Salvation Army well they watch entirely too much TV they have uh i think a lot of children do nowadays our with the with the athletics and the well they all took music lessons yeah yeah and uh so with everything that they were involved in the arts especially our high school kids didn't have time for TV yeah but i've worked well i work and live in the Denton area into what in the Denton Texas just north of Dallas uh-huh and uh you know i'll tell you i went to i graduated from the University of Nor th Texas a couple years ago and i you know went back as uh-huh  uh what are the capital punishment laws in your state uh they're or do you have it uh they're they're the death penalty can be imposed yeah uh or is it set for a specific crimes uh you know if you're convicted of this then it's the death penalty or or is it kind of just to the discretion under certain cases uh it's uh murder it it can be is i think is the only can be tried for you know for uh capital punishment yeah and i firmly believe in it yes uh i i'm the same way i feel that capital punishment ought to be mandatory under certain crimes i do too here in Utah there's been a a person that's been on death row for i oh seventeen years i think and they just keep retrying and retrying and i just it's just a waste of taxpayers' money and and i really think it would be a deterrent sounds like he'd grow old and die long before they get to kill him yes yes but uh seventeen years on death row um-hum uh i think he's that he's the longest one in the nation that and they just keep retrying him and retrying him well uh since they reinstated the death penalty was it about seven or eight years ago i think the shortest anybody's waited has been two or three years i mean death penalty does not seem to be swift for anybody no is what's the death penalty in Mississippi i so that's my understanding they do not have death penalty here right now um i mean the capital it doesn't make any sense that they don't but they don't um and right now to the best of my understanding there is nothing afoot to get it reinstated uh personally i think there should be death penalty for uh the death penalty should be available almost any major violent crime and mandatory for murder i i agree with you they believe it should be at least available as punishment for rape yes definitely i think if it was a serious possible of being executed for doing any of the major crimes that it would be a little less likely for people to commit them well one thing i can't understand is is these people that uh uh torture torture children and then murder i mean you know and then they're they eventually kill them yes and i definitely think that that should be a death penalty and they get less than than people that have are murdered yeah i don't understand that i i just can't see how come a person that has kills a little child can get away with two or three years or five years five to fifteen yeah and it because i don't know i if i think also they should be they uh somebody providing drugs to someone that kills the person yes that ought to be considered murder and potential death penalty boy we think alike i uh they used to have the death penalty in my home state of West Virginia oh and there it was death by hanging uh-huh uh uh but how old are you may i ask thirty four oh uh-huh and it when they eliminated death penalty all kinds of things changed yes they do uh the rate of crime doubled within about about a year or so um-hum and at that point when they were still hanging the uh state prison in Mountsville uh had a very small guard force and they had very little problems with their their inmates um-hum uh after they eliminated the death penalty shut down the gallows um-hum um-hum uh the place has gotten to the point where people who live in that area are all trying to get moved away it's become a maximum security prison they have had a whole lot more problems with breakouts with uh with violence within the the prison um-hum uh uh just the whole whole tenor of the thing has changed completely i wonder why i wonder why they don't uh don't uh see that they need the death penalty then because haven't you heard that they say that the death penalty does not uh deter crime who is it who said the death penalty doesn't deter crime well i'm sure it doesn't much now because the death penalty is very seldom uh given and used even then like you say it could be twenty twenty years between the time  what magazines are you reading these days well i get a uh quite a few uh we've said that our our magazine subscriptions uh really add up to a strange bunch but i get i get Business Week uh i get one called uh Dulcimer Player's News i get uh uh the Washington Post uh Weekly magazine uh we get Time uh and then i get uh uh well i guess i don't get any electronics magazines anymore i get uh electronics uh news newspaper uh what about you well i get the three um weeklies Newsweek and Time and US News i also get Sports Illustrated guess those are the only ones i get weekly and then once a month we get a whole slew of them we get Money Magazine and um Southern Living and Country Living and hm and um my wife has a whole ton of them she subscribes to oh yeah yeah a whole whole bunch of those well well i guess i guess the good thing about these um weekly magazines especially how they put things in them you know they have time to at least put things in perspective yeah but uh you know i guess the bad thing is they don't have the immediacy of you know radio or TV or a or a newspaper but they certainly can you know give you a bigger picture on things than than the than the daily media can yeah yeah that little bit of the of the whys behind what's happening and not just the the facts yeah i uh they can be responsive too i know this summer US News was going to take a week off in August and then when the attempted coup came along they quickly came out with an issue an issue that they weren't going to do yeah which shows that they're that they're certainly are responsive to changing events yeah yeah well i know that yeah and the category that i forgot is the the uh professional uh ones i'm i'm a member of uh I triple E and uh uh ACM Association for Community Materials i get uh three or four uh the magazine magazine form things uh that way uh too so uh i i don't know what the what the status is in general of of people reading magazines i i certainly uh do a lot of it and and uh newspapers for that matter but i uh i've heard that the trend in reading in general and and in especially newspapers is down that people just well i think you're right i think trend in reading i think one reason that the Times Herald folded and other papers folded is the people are reading newspapers less than they used to and i guess that means they must be reading magazines and you know other written stuff less too yeah i think i think so i i don't i haven't heard exactly how it's effecting the magazines maybe not quite as much but uh i think that the more and more people are just depending on the TV for what what news they do get and of course then you have the specialty magazines like magazines on baseball or Golf Digest or or knitting or crocheting and all these things oh yeah yeah that have a selective market that just aim at one kind of thing those maybe it's that the that the special purpose magazines are doing better and the ones that are more general aren't doing as well that could be that could be because there's not there's not really an alternative uh uh source for that kind of kind of information but uh yeah i guess if you want to find out a specific item you have nowhere else to turn if you want to find out the the latest in gardening trends unless you read a gardening magazine you're not going to find this anyplace else yeah yeah yeah whereas if you want to know what happened in in in Russia today you can turn on the radio or TV and you don't really have to read a paper or magazine to find out something right that may be it and with desktop publishing and stuff i think a lot more magazines that are that aim just smaller market will be coming out yeah i i wonder if that i wonder if that will uh uh make things different i've heard that uh read an article just last week about fax newspapers coming out and wonder if they'll do that with uh you know magazine kinds of things as well i uh was it uh uh Skip uh Bayless yeah i heard uh i heard it too Skip Bayless wasn't it yeah from the Times Herald is doing a a fax sports column yeah i read three times a week he's going to fax you the sports column i don't know i don't know how that will catch on uh no but uh uh it was interesting uh yeah i thought that i that would be interesting to to see though um kind of and it they for a long time they've been talking about that you know that that moving away from paper magazines uh i guess would it be included in that in terms of of uh computer access and stuff but that that doesn't really seem to have caught on to the extent that they keep predicting uh well you know you you you don't have time  okay okay uh so what do you think about the school system well i think they're they're having a lot of trouble right now i know my son goes to a private school but uh i think they're big city public schools by definition are having a a tough time right now just from uh probably from budget cuts and and everything else going on uh why why did you choose a private school well i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a at a pace a little faster than he was gonna be able to moved be moved in public school so he's he has been going to private since kindergarten so public school oh has he and how does he like it oh he's loved it he's a senior in high school this year so he's yeah he's done it the whole twelve and a so many years and it's been uh it's been really good for him so he's been there all time how big of a school is it uh overall on campus about twelve hundred but in the upper school upper four grades uh about four hundred and something so it's maybe a hundred per grade a hundred per grade that's a good size yeah it really is kind of gives them the you know like get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids but uh yeah that was we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture and so they don't that's good he's done he's done really well and just he was just ahead at an early age and i didn't feel like uh in what was available particularly in the first three grades um-hum and even in the fourth grade when they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program huh and i just didn't think that was gonna get it i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead uh everyday right but yet still be with his peers age wise still enjoy the right um one thing i think i've noticed is uh my my oldest is in kindergarten so i'm in a little different ballgame i'm just starting i you're just getting started but uh seems to me that uh kids these days uh can really get away with murder and the teachers don't have as much aren't respected as much and uh they have to be some careful of the things they do and say yeah i know that's that's a big problem and uh makes me a little nervous that uh students don't seem to show that respect and we wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we were in school wouldn't have thought of it and you know and they'll stand there now with them toe to toe and no heavens no no you wouldn't and uh the things they can say and do to a teacher and they do from what i understand uh i think that's wrong i think we need to get back to the show some respect and course i guess the teacher used to warrant that but yeah but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home anymore like it used to be basic respect for elders and adults particularly in in responsible positions have not uh right for other people and i don't think it's had that basic upbringing in a lot of cases and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands well how do you think that's happened you think our society's just uh stopped talking out or this uh generation's just kind of changed a little bit uh i guess i well the world changes so i mean obviously kids are not the same now as they used to be i mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things they have a whole lot more right uh variety of things that they're that they see and do at an earlier age so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time but but still i think it goes back to a commitment by the parents to to teach uh basic values and basic uh respectful of uh respectfulness of authority right and i just don't think that this doesn't always get emphasized anymore uh that just isn't coming through is it no i mean i remember uh well it was a big thing when they let girls wear Levi's we used to have to wear dresses and then you had to uh go to dresses they had to be a pantsuit and it was polyester and it had to be matching and yeah had to wear dresses didn't you and when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor and we hold the ruler up here and it's no more than so many inches above the knee because it was mini skirt time back there at one time yes exactly yes yes so it's really changed it's uh really kind of gone the rounds so i think think that maybe that's effected it to some degree they say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit so i yeah i think that probably does have have something to do with it that it's also do uh does does this school your son goes to do they uh required required to wear a uniform or no they do not do uniforms although one's where he was between like second and eighth grade did uh-huh yeah there are quite a few of your schools  Brian in Plano Texas how are you doing today hi fine i'm Nancy how are you great Nancy i'm in Plano also yes we're not too long distance today you're in Plano also uh well good to hear i was just talking to someone the other day from Pennsylvania oh that was good Utah i've had a couple of but that was it really yeah all right well good to hear good to hear learned about their basketball team which one uh Jazz oh yeah the Utah Jazz yeah yeah yeah they're they're pretty good they got some that's what i heard yeah good good some good uh good players out there yeah well you ready for New Year's Eve i am good should we uh start this so we can what was your name again Nancy that's right and i'm Brian just a moment okay Nancy right right okay Nancy the i guess the today's subject is benefits in a job other than salary what uh what do you feel are important to you or other people as as crucial benefits right uh-huh well i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job uh-huh i'm a nurse and i work i float oh uh-huh so that i have no benefits except higher pay for doing that right uh-huh so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance and i i make enough money by the hour to make up for that to to compensate for some of the benefits oh right uh-huh yeah it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace yes and then i have my freedom i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do well that's that's an excellent so actually that is a benefit uh well it is to me most people prefer the security of nine to five and weekends off and yeah knowing that their insurance is paid and their retirement and i'm just really not interested in all that right right well i guess that's a good point uh i do belong to a a large corporation or my that where i'm currently employed uh-huh and there's uh there's some different things uh one that you've already mentioned is is health insurance i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates as a through a group plan right as opposed to going out and getting health insurance on an individual basis because i had to do that at one time when i wasn't employed with a large corporation and that got to be somewhat expensive and so i i think one of the benefits i i see is the uh is the group uh group discount yeah right and especially if you have a family then i think it makes a big difference yeah and yes and that's that's one thing i do have yeah if i didn't have a family i don't think i would have as as a male or as a as an individual of in this stage of my life i don't think i would have insurance uh other right i don't think i would go through that expense one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours and in my previous job i really enjoyed because they had what was called a flex schedule where i could go and i could work uh nine hour days and have like Friday only work four hours or i could do uh work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a four you know three week day weekend oh yeah right and make uh make my job flexible in that case could you change that as you felt like it or did you have to do it the same every week well basically yeah i had to do that uh the same uh for about every quarter of the year i mean uh-huh uh because i was in a in a position of management i had responsibilities over people that uh i needed to make my schedule uh so that if i was not there i would have coverage by some other management personnel so um-hum so i i think that uh that was a that was an excellent benefit that i really enjoyed and i don't currently have that in my current operation but uh yeah you mentioned uh flexible work schedule and that's that's good yeah and uh what other benefits do you think are important oh well i guess retirement that kind of thing which i don't worry much about so yeah yeah that's true i just prefer to worry about today and probably not a practical attitude but that's who i am so well and that's an individual thing um-hum yeah with uh with our current uh organization we do have a nice retirement package and also a a nice thing that that we have in our corporation is a uh is a profit sharing plan where we can uh participate in the the profits of the company if we're you know if we've been there a while and we're vested uh which means that you know we have a an interest uh in the company that we can right uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times and uh also uh in one of my wife's uh companies where she worked they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that that effectively they made a certain  uh subject is gun control uh do you own any guns yeah uh besides a a a BB gun no um a lot of my family owns a lot of guns and stuff and i i have a lot of friends that do also a lot of my friends are really into guns as far as knowing the specifications of every gun there is just about yeah yeah i know the sort i'm not much into guns myself either i don't know i enjoy working with them from time to time but yeah yeah um personal opinion there's a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldn't be available at all yeah that's that's my opinion is that some of these high powered handguns need to go out the window because they're obviously not for hunting um yeah they've got and a handgun was never designed for hunting well very few of them it they do make some for bird hunting but still those aren't real high powered they're just you know small caliber with a long barrel on them yeah yeah but uh no these and and these assault weapons with real short stock short barrels and yeah these these the the nine millimeter the nine millimeter Glock to to top the charts armor piercing ammunition it's a it's a plastic automatic weapon that fires yeah they sell them here at Wal-Mart three different models of Glock yeah Wal-Mart wow wow Wal-Mart sporting goods department here in town carries carries the Glock hm they haven't got the the latest version but uh they've got them yeah something like seventeen rounds in a double wide clip seventeen seventeen rounds of clip that fires by itself craziness like that practically yeah did did you hear about the the killing spree in Colleen over here in Texas no no i didn't we had a guy that went through a Luby's in Colleen and like killed twenty three people and injured a hundred plus others Luby's and then killed himself what's a Luby's uh it's a cafeteria or restaurant oh wait yeah uh uh that's been several months ago yeah several several months ago yeah okay yeah i did hear about that and they weren't the least bit sure what happened what what set him off that's that's what well nobody really knows what it was it was they determined that it was a a series of events over the years of some sort form of hatred of women and that's why he was mostly shooting women oh see i hadn't heard anything about you know what the bulk of his victims were but uh he was just a wacko yeah but that shows you what a a a Glock automatic weapon will do that's what he was using yeah he had that and uh one other gun which i don't recall what it was was it a rifle or a pistol but the Glock oh the other gun it was another handgun no no the the other gun okay no i hadn't i i hadn't heard what it was he was carrying all i knew is he'd been in there shooting i hadn't heard any about what he was carrying yeah it was that's what it was he went around putting holes in anything he wanted to at whatever rate of speed he felt like yeah i do know they have uh fast uh fast recovery yeah uh goodness well uh they i i i also agree with the uh the seven day wait on handguns that's a yeah probably ought to be longer than that really yeah seven is probably as long as you can expect the law to to require yeah at at the moment they want seven days and that's you know that's the best thing we got to work with go for it yeah seven day wait waiting period and the check through the FBI files and yeah because i i really can't understand why these legislatures wanna fight it unless they just don't have anything better to do yeah yeah they ought to carry they ought anybody with a permit to carry a gun uh you ought to have a permit for any kind of gun you carry period yeah whether it's pistol or rifle or it doesn't matter and the permit you ought a ought to be required to keep it in your billfold at all times whether you got your gun with you or not like a driver's license yeah you should have a a a permit to use it and a uh be trained on how to use it yeah uh it's part of the problem with guns in general they got hundreds out there you know the only experience they got is the you know the last couple times they got about half looped and went out and the gun and went out in the woods and started blowing up bottles yep every hunting season scares the stew out of me even just to drive by a section of woods bothers me a little bit because i know there's maniacs out there the first couple of days um yeah my my dad has borrowed a uh thirty thirty from uh his uh nephew and is supposed to go hunting and i i'm really really kind of nervous about it myself because i don't want him to yeah go out there and get hurt hm later on in the season it gets to be less of a problem especially  oh do you have very many family reunions that one you have over to Bear Lake is the grandfather of all of them isn't it um oh yeah now that one's a fun one that that is fun i know that sometimes i've the one that's been hard for me is the one that the Skidmores used to do at Christmas time oh and i i think its just because it was i seem to always be bad weather and i'm just going over the oh uh-huh you know the yeah its just right after Christmas that one was kind of hard i think that was a hard time but mountains uh-huh oh they don't have that anymore well they haven't since his grandmother died and i don't know if you know they they just continued it kind of while oh she was still alive and and uh just nobody's done anything about it since she passed away but i don't know i mean it was always nice but it was just kind of a hard time i think uh-huh do you have any other reunions yeah um yeah my my side of the family usually has let's see i went to one at that was at my um actually it was in Layton and it was up my father's grandfather's house where his mother had been raised a little bit of the time they've they've still got this old home in their family and oh and that uh uh it was really a fun one that was nice to get to know a lot of the people though that we don't know and we just had a big um-hum um they had big grill that they cooked chicken and what'd they have chicken and i guess ribs and then they just did they had a little program and they made a quilt and gave it away hum they didn't auction it or anything um well they they um i think they drew names is what they did oh oh uh-huh people well no they did auction it well people bought a ticket that's how they did it and then the person with the winning ticket got it and things like that and that was kind of a fun one yeah oh with the one up to the up to Bear Lake do you uh do anything like genealogy or or anything like that no we just goof off just play yeah oh uh my family goes up to uh Cub River up to Willow Flat oh uh-huh for three days every year i mean it's there's not as much to do up as there is up at Bear Lake but we just go and camp out and wade in the river and now now is that the same time of year no that's the fourth of July one that we go down to the cabin no okay because i it's is that kind of a family reunion too yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah but but that's but the one that we go up to Bear Lake with my family is the more more people come it's my father's and mother's children that go to that one oh i see oh and so but and then we have a great big Johnson one about every other year that we make that we make a quilt and sell it uh-huh and then we'll we'll sell chances on it and then that pays for all of the mailing and everything that's concerned with it yeah it does it works out really good yeah oh that's nice nice yeah we have they've organized a um like a family i don't know just some family organization on my dad's side and we do we pay dues oh uh-huh i think this year we just paid like ten dollars and and then they sent have started sending out a news letter on people and and um you know somebody's gone to a lot of work and they've they're doing a real good job and uh-huh uh-huh and so oh yeah i'm not good at things like that so just wait till it falls in your lap huh neither am i but it's really important i think to keep those connections it is it is and i know there's been a lot of years we haven't gone and then when we do go it doesn't seem like we know anybody and so i think it is good to keep going and yeah uh-huh and keep those family ties up uh-huh yeah well i i don't know we've the Waites had a reunion too but that that fell every other every other year but that fell through because people just wouldn't take charge and do it oh so and maybe there's a time to let go too yeah but that's that is kind of sad when uh nobody does want to do it yeah i don't know i uh-huh but then people get involved in other things and involved in others you know but i think it's really important to keep the your generation and the earlier generation together oh it is it is oh well and and so you just you have the two on so either side but you didn't have the one this year is this the first year you didn't have it on your husband's side uh-huh we had a we had the the the one the small one and then for his too we have a great big Christmas party every year oh i see oh and and then the the summer one fourth of around the fourth of July huh uh-huh but the the i don't know they those are are just his immediate family oh they're not extended it's not extended huh is that say we have to quit i don't know i've never heard that one before neither have i you you say how many calls have you made  kind of a heavy topic tonight right about uh that's you have to start the new year out by the way Happy New Year thank you same to you what do you think about the uh that idea that they're recommending for the young people i hadn't really heard that before um uh-huh i had at one point thought about doing the Peace Corps myself many years ago um yeah you know many years ago it seemed like they had uh um involuntary enlistment and mainly like in the fifties i know a lot of uh men that were into the military you had to go into the military uh-huh um i don't know about that a lot of people i don't think would like it because it's gonna interrupt college plans but a lot of people don't have plans so for them it might give them a little help to uh uh-huh get uh some kind of more awareness about the world and be of some use for a while uh-huh i i personally think it would be a a good idea um i have kind of a same well it's not a really a Peace Corps experience it's a little bit similar you may assume that being from Utah member a member of the Mormon church and we do a lot of missionary work and i spent two years when i was nineteen in Argentina um-hum um-hum um and uh i'll tell you that gives you a different perspective of uh you know some of the things we have here in this country that uh people really uh don't appreciate and seeing a different culture and uh getting to know a kind of a different a different people i think was a good experience for anyone regardless of uh you know their particular endeavor they're engaged engaged in i think just getting out of the country is a great benefit to anyone so have you ever lived abroad or spent anytime outside of the United States um-hum i haven't no but um i had known of the Peace Corps because i had a cousin in the Peace Corps course you know it was much more publicized in the sixties i don't even know if they have it today uh-huh yeah i had a friend though in the seventies join uh Vista uh-huh which is a similar program although you stay within the US which can be very beneficial too i mean a lot of times there's a lot of help we can do within the US um and that yeah oh sure you bet it program i thought was excellent um-hum um i just don't think they even i don't know if they have those programs anymore or if they even try to publicize it and recruit and i think that's a shame because both of those programs programs are excellent and uh hopefully don't and i it seems like they excuse me but it seems like they used to advertise it on TV in the the Peace Corps i don't remember i just i haven't seen it recently yeah so not that you know not down here any i don't i don't remember seeing anything about Vista or or the Peace Corps recently um-hum well i think it would be a good idea is a it is kind of a delicate time but by the same token at that age they haven't really settled down don't have a family or other commitments as well and so there's some divantages to going at that particular time in your life right right and uh well well i think yeah i think it would be extremely beneficial to just about everybody yeah um i i could see that there'd be some people that you know would throw up their arms about it and go i'm going to Harvard and i you know this isn't something i wanna do but uh you're right it would give everybody a better perspective of uh you know ourselves and what we have maybe make us appreciate what we have a little more so yeah um-hum yeah that's that's certainly my was my experience just uh it was like the the uh clock had been turned back about ten or fifteen years um-hum you know just the difference in the technologies in the two countries the kinds of cars they drove the you know simple things like central heating and uh and having a gas fired um water heater you know things that that we really appreciate are are not commonplace in in every uh in every uh city that i was uh living in um right i had uh twice now been a big sister you've heard of big brothers big sisters uh-huh yeah and uh i have had uh two little sisters and even though they were local to me it was almost being in a different world because both of my sisters little sisters came from very poor backgrounds uh-huh and of course they don't have usually normal families i mean there's not a a mother and a father and yeah right they live in pretty poor housing and um their education is very lacking because their parents you know don't uh encourage them to go to school um-hum um so that was beneficial to me as well as the child because uh made me appreciate my background a little more and i helped to give this person um a more one on one idea of there can be a different life than what they've had and it to uh experience some things that otherwise they wouldn't be able to get out and do um-hum yeah is that uh a program where you're you uh commit for a certain number of months or or you you're assigned a a child and you you stay with them for as long as you can it's usually a year um and they try to find somebody in the local area to you and um you know the age group that you wanna work uh-huh  okay i guess tonight's subject is uh woodworking do you uh what kind of woodworking do you do well kind kind of mainly the woodworking i've done lately is uh made like uh for example a little nativity scene um uh-huh not the uh the whole figurines and so forth but mainly the stable put some shelves in and and some odd stuff around the house and so i i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking and i do it out of hobby more than uh um you know something i have to do how about yourself uh well well it yeah i like to think of it as a hobby but i i guess also partly out of necessity just repairing things around the house um a few years ago uh we we needed uh they needed some book shelves and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves and um uh it it actually worked pretty well and over the years i've i've refined those plans i got myself a router and i'm i'm very good at making book shelves uh-huh it it's also a way of relieving stress my wife kind of laughs at me that anytime i get stressed i just go out in the garage and we've got more book shelves but well i'll have to come and see them that sounds like a good idea i you know and that's that is right it is out of necessity because a lot of the things that uh well we can't be able to afford but also i i sometimes sometimes think that uh i enjoy doing that and i like to get out and and uh to work with my hands and uh sounds like you got some real nice tools too do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools uh well yeah i mean little by little i i started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things uh um-hum gotten a a good belt sander and and the router uh helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router um-hum the latest project that i've been working on and and this has kind of been sitting here for a few months is a a cabinet to to put a TV in oh a entertainment type center oh right and it that's works well because you can design it to to suit whatever equipments you have right so i designed a space just the right size for the TV and then the the the VCR and shelves on the side for my stereo equipment and uh right right that's worked pretty well uh with uh with the router you can make nice uh i guess dado joints is what it's called right or yes i yeah i'm aware of that um and it's uh and also with a router you can uh make ornamental facings too better than a just straight wood edge and uh that's right that's right and uh so casings and so forth that are that are real nice so that that's good that's good what i what i need next is a good table saw and i i debate whether it the better if you get a uh yeah just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what they're called oh uh-huh um it it seems to me the radial arm saws is better well it it takes up less room i mean you you set the wood down and you move the saw whereas if you're ripping wood you're probably better off with a a table saw yes yes well and with a radial arm saw if you do have a a big piece of wood that you need to rip like you say or cut you wouldn't be able to do that um but uh yeah a table saw does take a lot of time excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment and uh yeah uh that that's partly my problem now is i don't have room for this i uh a we're uh where we lived before up north uh basements were were common and i could've put all this stuff in my basement but not so here in Texas uh-huh yes uh-huh no they don't have basements well i'm from up north also and and uh no there's no basements down here and it's kind of uh hard to get uh shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room for that yeah yeah lot of the equipment too that i've i've used in the past uh i would you know i've used in school and uh i would i don't know i'd i'd kind of like to to look at equipment like a lathe or like you say a table saw and some of those things that would make uh some pretty nice uh pieces of uh well wood for for different things for tables for for or um chairs for you know decks and so forth so um-hum i don't know i i just enjoy woodworking and i think the the main thing is like you say it's a it's a good out it's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day and it's a great strase stress reliever have you ever used a lathe yes i have in school i have and i've made uh uh different things uh lathe type tables for chairs and i've made uh bowls and um and uh  think the Cowboys are gonna go further or is this the end of the line no i think the Cowboys have a good chance to really um possibly take it all the way they're one of the they're one of two teams that actually beat Washington Redskins ah however Washington has been uh what do you call it has been resting up and uh that could really hurt the Cowboys especially if they have a lot of injuries coming into uh the next two games well there was a uh article in the Wall Street Journal oh a couple weeks ago before the play-offs started and it said their long shot prediction was Cowboys versus Oilers in the Super Bowl then they gave their reasons why they thought both of those teams had a had a decent chance at it well uh that would be an interesting game i think that game would be sold out what do you think yeah i don't think there'd be any problem there the only question is would the rest of the country be interested in watching two Texas teams slug it out yes i think so because uh i think Warren Moon and uh Steve Beuerlein and Troy Aikman are some of the hottest quarterbacks for the uh for the nineteen nineties yeah they'll probably want to see Emmett Smith and uh and uh see Novacek and see Irwin out there and and the no name defense so who knows yeah the no name defense that's pretty good well and then Houston's got a a good core of about good five good receivers out there that uh that Moon likes to likes to throw to well did you see in the paper last Sunday about uh the salaries for the different um uh players yeah i sure did well what do you think about uh Montana being paid so much for not playing this year well he he had himself a good contract you know if he's got a contract that pays him regardless of injuries he's in good shape well you know that Michael Irvin's going to get a big boost and already uh Jones has said that uh they anticipate that he'll be giving Michael Irvin a big pay raise so i think that'll be coming sure sure i think it will be too and i think Steve Beuerlein might get a little raise too he's uh um Troy Aikman i wonder even though he's a real good player i wonder if he's going to be able to uh stand the physical abuse that the NFL offers he might not make it well his problem is that he since he doesn't seem as mobile as some of the other quarterbacks he seems to get one bad injury every year so Beuerlein or someone like Beuerlein is going to be a necessity while Aikman's around yep so what do you think about uh the games that's going to be played uh tomorrow Buffalo and who they playing the uh uh Buffalo's playing um Kansas City Kansas City Chiefs well i i really think Buffalo will will win the game i'll be surprised if Kansas City wins it but uh Houston Denver um that one might be more even than than people would otherwise think i don't think that one's gonna be uh blow out for anybody it might be a pretty close game yeah i think John Elway still has a hot hand the trouble is is sometimes it's cold and uh he's not consistent he he has a good day he has a bad day and you and you never know um i like that these other quarterbacks that that are are more consistent i think Beuerlein has been more consistent well Beuerlein's only had interceptions in one of the six games he's played and although he isn't throwing that many passes or completing that many you know if you're completing them to the right people at the right time you've got a running game you don't have to throw fifty times right you know you know we're watching the Bowl games yesterday and there's some amazing Bowl games some of those guys'll be pros there's one fellow plays for my wife's school East Carolina named uh Jeff Blake and he's gonna almost surely be drafted by the pros he had an incredible day yesterday right hm he um threw for four touchdown passes and ran for one and he had an amazing day he rallied the team down from seventeen points in the middle of the fourth quarter to score three unanswered touchdowns in less than six minutes it was an amazing performance i missed the name who was that again it was Jeff Blake B L A K E he's the quarterback East Carolina he's pretty well rewritten the record books and i guess the pros will pay a good attention to him i didn't i didn't watch that game uh i did watch the Notre Dame game well they certainly came from behind to pull it off didn't they yes i i think that um the coach there is uh really made a name for himself with Arkansas now with Notre Dame well both those games were the only two exciting Bowl games yesterday i think the other six games were either blowouts or like the Cotton Bowl a disaster yeah that was a low scoring game but well it was it was a disaster a total disaster well i don't i don't know about Detroit they they've got a lot of injuries they may have beaten the Cowboys thirty four to to ten  are you in the market for a new car um well actually about six months ago we were uh but it was kind of a different type deal we had uh a large conversion van that and we're looking to sell it too oh oh uh to get a smaller car but but when i was looking for the van we were looking around quite a bit uh-huh oh you need to down uh-huh and did you were you happy with the van you found oh yeah yeah as a matter of fact the reason we sold the van was just so that my wife could stay home with our two boys now oh uh-huh so we got rid of that big payment and so now she now she's a stay at home mom right right did they use a lot of gas those vans um it did fairly well for me uh i got about fifteen sixteen um-hum oh that is pretty good in in the that's combination city and highway driving and then on the open road i can get about nineteen or twenty oh that oh yeah that is nice i thought they used a lot more gas than that ah hum-um yeah you would think it'd be a lot worse i know mini vans don't get much better than that they get about twenty one twenty two no right around there oh well that's interesting we are just in the opposite situation of you we're looking for something bigger we have four children we just had yeah ah ah a new baby and so the car that we have only has the five seat belts and we need you know when we're all going in it we need six um-hum yeah so we're looking for something bigger and i uh-huh i don't know we have a little Honda car that my husband uses it uh-huh to commute back and forth to work and it has been it almost has two hundred thousand miles wow you got your use out of that right and it's been such a good car but i wish they made Hondas with the six seat belts i i don't i don't think they make them that big yeah that's true no i don't think so and i i'm not sure that i'm ready for a van yet yeah i have looked at some of the uh Toyota Toyota makes a real nice van i i like theirs a lot oh oh uh but if you really want size you know the prices are about the same depend you know you can spend as much on a mini van as you do on a full size conversion van uh-huh oh and the difference is the the conversion of course the mileage is a little bit worse uh-huh but because you do have a bigger engine and bigger transmission you can pull stuff like trailers and boats and stuff easier than you can with a you know the other mini van right uh-huh oh are there a lot of vans down there my brother lives in Plano Texas and he said there's vans all over the place oh um-hum oh yeah yeah just lots and lots of vans so that's i was kind of i my preference would to be just to go to a bigger car i think rather than rather than a van but you know even that is it's hard to find a car that is big enough i guess um-hum the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we oh it doesn't yeah um-hum we didn't get the bench seat up front so yeah well i don't know if you'd be how how old is your oldest eight uh-huh eight yeah see i i don't know how long you'd be happy like that well i don't know how often all all six of you all will be in the car but i know that once you get one or two car seats in there right that takes up a lot of room ah and then that yeah then you'd have your eight year old you'd probably have your eight year old up front on the bench seat uh-huh but even even then after a while you'd feel cramped especially if it was ah you know a fairly long trip in more than about an hour that's true that's true i haven't i haven't thought about that because is there a lot more room in the regular size vans than in a car uh oh yes definitely you you know a station wagon the back end of a station wagon probably can carry as much as a van but as for passenger space ah you can't beat a van because you can you can you can carry seven in a van and that's a mini van oh uh-huh on a large conversion van you can you know you can carry a lot you can carry about nine oh so now why did you go with a large conversion van when you went well because for what i wanted in a van the mini vans were were about a thousand dollars less um-hum and you get almost twice the room in the conversion van than you do in the mini van oh oh plus like i said all the extra pulling power and i didn't feel i was losing that much on gas mileage because they're not that far off uh-huh oh right did you buy it new was it yeah it was a new one uh-huh oh and that's only about a thousand dollars difference yeah i mean i was really surprised yeah that surprises me too because because when you you know you can like pick Dodge for instance they got two sizes of mini vans one's the extra long and then the other the extra long option with all the power options you know windows locks and the nice stereo um-hum uh-huh it was only about fifteen hundred less than the comparable full size van my word and you know like i said uh the mileage on a mini van is about oh twenty one twenty two on the highway and on the you know on the full size it was nineteen twenty nineteen so that's still comparable and that's nothing yeah so you know i i said you know given that i said wow  hi uh how do you feel about gun control oh i don't like a total ban on it but on the other hand i don't like total idiots pulling what they did down in uh my home state of Texas down in uh near Fort Hood yeah uh-huh uh i think the right of ownership needs to be protected but i don't think there's too much wrong with having it registered and having you think about it a little bit i don't think so either and i think that every gun should be covered cover covered um because i think that uh and it doesn't hurt people to have a waiting period well they make us wait to get married in most states i don't yes right unless you want to fly to Las Vegas or so uh-huh but i yeah uh it's just sickening i was on the University of Texas campus when that Chapman climbed the tower and killed twenty two people one of my friends was wounded and he was from kill a La Paz Bolivia and they flew and got his mother here real quick but and a hippie pulled him out of the out of the additional gunshot range so ever since then old Oscar said hippies are okay my buddy uh it was back in the sixties when Vietnam was going on so yes i remember when that happened so i've lived in New York City where they have a uh pistol control and uh big deal you go across the county line into Yonkers and you can buy a pistol and come back into the city so there isn't really a gun control there not really no uh well i i think that every gun should be covered from rifles and the automatics and and handguns because people need if they're out after a gun they need a cooling off period yeah we have guns in our home but my husband uh used to hunt all my sons hunt um i've got a shotgun and a pistol oh we have and the kids have BBs sometimes i think they're about as dangerous but uh well i'd shoot it more often it wasn't against the city ordinance those birds steal my dog's bird dog food my i don't think that's fair yeah well we live close to the Wasatch well we live right on the Wasatch front so we're only about well we have mountains in our backyard and the deer come down and eat our um uh shrubs during the winter do they really uh-huh we we had a snow storm the other day and the deer come down and eat the shrubs they keep them trimmed for us we got the air-conditioning going in the building today oh my heck it must be seventy five degrees out there i think it's about twenty well it's about twenty eight here i don't think that has anything to do with gun control no uh but i i'm i i i don't think it's a constitutional well so what if it's constitutional or not if if if my wife drives to west Texas alone she's going to carry a gun i don't care what they say well don't you think too if the government i mean like in Yugoslavia and these places that the government comes in and takes over China don't you think if the people had a gun they would have more say in in in establishing a democracy uh-huh wasn't that amazing Yugoslavia was a semi Soviet state and no guns were allowed and all of a sudden everybody has one that wants to fight the war where did they come from yeah uh-huh they were hidden under the bed all these years then they must have been i don't know i don't know they must have been hidden somewhere because they came out well you know one thing about the Killeen situation that was pointed up is there were a lot of military people in the in and around uh-huh uh if the military had been allowed to carry even side arms they could have stopped this idiot quicker um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh i had a cop once say in Texas it's not against the law let's see what i say i said it would be all right legally if i put on a a side gun and walked down the street with a gun strapped on my side it's clear view and you couldn't arrest me he said yes i can arrest you i said what for he said breaking the peace i said who's peace am a bothering he said mine i'm the cop that was that was a joke it was a joke is that right oh oh but i think if you take them away from everybody then only criminals will have it and you would have more problems but but registration won't hurt anybody will it no that's what i think that it should be is registration and guns that can be traced yeah you can go to pawnshop i don't i don't know if you all live near big city Salt Lake City if they've got them or not but you go to a pawnshop and buy it for cash and you don't have to show nothing but then no i think they have um and you just hand over the cash and that's it yeah you if you can show them a driver's license but you can steal those so easily it's pitiful uh-huh well i'm about an eight on that i think that uh that we need gun control but you know so many laws would be uh necessary if we'd just use common sense um-hum you know just registering the guns and wow i don't know i guess people lose their common sense when they when they get mad or when they get too drunk uh-huh uh-huh i'll be there's a law in Texas says you can't have them in bar i think it would be a lot more sense if they say please check them at the front door because i know people are in there with them on oh really oh yeah i it just nerve racking to know that if you're in a that that you're in the bar and somebody has a gun next to you yeah they're not supposed to but then again so  so uh what do you think about child care oh well my my feelings on are it is uh i wouldn't take a child to a day care you know i mean i'd i'd wind up um just a babysitter in a home right probably find someone how come you wouldn't take them to a day care just because of the um um well too many kids and and i think too many infections and things coming in yeah they seem to pass a lot a yeah sicknesses and i don't know then all the things you hear about them and yeah you kind of wonder whether or not yeah i mean i'm sure there's some good ones but i just i don't think that i would hum i took uh Cammy to a oh it was a preschool day care type of thing oh uh-huh but i kind of i liked it in some ways and some ways i didn't um i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important oh yeah yeah how was it and well i think they had a they had two teachers and i think there were twenty kids but i only had her going two days and most the other kids were going more days so that was probably my own fault oh that she didn't oh you know one thing i noticed is uh she she went um just they were trying to get her to teach her to write her name and uh i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she'd bend her wrist all the way oh not in a natural shape form oh she did yes and uh i was kind of mad mad that they had never noticed that and either pointed it out to me or or uh tried to say look you're holding your she's holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff she but she was uh wrapping her arm all the way around yeah yes and uh i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point she was four or three yeah she was uh it was last year and uh then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on and i worked like i said i didn't notice it till then oh because i hadn't worked with writing letters or anything and uh-huh stuff like that well they'd never picked it out though huh or just never said anything no they never course like i said i took her two days a week and maybe that was my main reason for taking her was um just social skills more than anything else yeah yeah i felt she needed the social just i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially and yeah well one thing that's kind of different too though a preschool than than taking a a infant under to a day care where they're taken care of um um-hum oh yeah i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know preschool's a different thing but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know and or unless you have awfully good references yeah yeah reliable um people i don't know it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long well i think it's hard to leave them it is it is the older ones it's not you don't even really have any real worries because you know that they'll play with whoever's there and they usually adapt pretty well yeah but uh yeah it it is i think just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will um well and you know their kind of their schedules and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal yeah yeah i don't know how um people uh that have young kids work and work full time and and do it really without being stressed out all the time i think it's well i don't know then then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some regards it's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess and you haven't got anything done and what am i gonna fix for supper oh yeah oh yeah that is uh yeah it's kind of hard to always feel like gosh what is is this important what i'm doing and yeah well um the work never ends for sure uh no no it it doesn't huh but i think that taking kids to a probably people that take them to uh preschools and day cares full time oh they would i don't know probably just feel a different uh i think i just think it would be hard to do that full time i feel such a responsibility even when we go out for a few hours that are they driving the babysitter crazy and uh uh-huh or is everything okay you know what  now then are you there okay yeah i'm here so they're recording everything now alrighty but you tell me the crime is rampant out there its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house and on New Year's Eve you know how it's supposed to be bringing in the new year and everything the with the neighborhood we have around here it was automatic gunfire going off instead of fire works yes um well that's what we have had here in Dallas for oh for the past year we lost so many people due to crime this past year so what do you think is the solution to any of this well personally i've got two kids and personally i'd like to see them teach something about it like in schools not make it mandatory but an optional thing you know ways to avoid situations do you think drugs have any have i think it has a lot to do with it do you think that's the majority of our crime um well i'd say about half well i think here in Dallas we've got uh its greater than that i think you know like ninety percent of our crime is um connected with the the drug scene because we most beg your pardon go ahead most of our crime around here is uh it's gang related gang violence gangs fighting gangs and i think that's what really scares me because i mean around here if you like if you wear red yeah one gang will take offense to it okay and if you wear black the other gang will take offense to it so you have to wear you know something neutral like blue in order not to get bothered around here i mean people get bothered at the grocery stores and everything its getting pretty bad you mean in their clothing they okay yeah well i did i'm not aware of that being part of our problem it's just that uh seems like these kids or older people that um need the drug need the money for the drugs and then they're shooting and we have we had a little boy in west uh well it's west of here was riding in the car with his mother and father on New Year's Eve night and someone fired into the car there were three children in the backseat and the little boy that was in the uh an infant seat was dead they did the the mother and father did not even realize oh no that there had been ah i mean they thought fire crackers and that sort of thing oh yeah and when they arrived where they were to have had celebrated New Year's they found this baby dead and the bullet hole directly behind the driver's seat oh now this is something that my Lord something's got to give someone has to do something i know and it's the innocent people that are paying for it it's not even the people that are doing it that are paying for it it's the innocent ones that are dying from it and it's not fair well that's right yes no way can we um anyway i pray that you have a good New Year i hope it's a safe New Year for you and have what about this isn't part of the conversation but have you had any rain out there oh we've had a lot of it out here okay that's what i understand California needs but yeah it it we do need it and there's been an awful lot of it well i mean when you live in Texas you accept it when it comes yeah and don't complain about it i guess you guys had a pretty good storm a while back though oh i still have an apartment that has furniture up on bricks because of the rain um-hum and i live in a a nice part of Dallas but um oh really anyway if the if the criminals and do not come around here i'm going to be extremely fortunate um-hum yeah my my husband and i are thinking about moving because we've got two little boys and it's just getting so bad around here that i'm afraid to even let them go out and play i mean it's it's really bad with the gangs and everything you mean this is not occur after after sundown its during the day too the majority of it is at night but like the shootings and stuff on the freeways are done in broad daylight nobody will say anything because everybody's afraid are  okay universal health insurance right okay um that's right um what would we like to say i think well i think universal health insurance like national health like what Canada has is that what you're you're thinking this subject is about um-hum i think that's what the subject is about did you read uh the article in the paper today about this particular subject in the Dallas the Morning Times i guess i did not yeah uh the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is uh going to begin testing a program a state funded program for citizens of those two states and there's fourteen other uh states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning i think it's a trend that's that's that's uh probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need it's getting to a point that you have to have it you have to have some form of health insurance and extremely expensive though well it's been interesting that we yes so we live in a society though where everyone if you ask them on polls will um say that they think that everyone has a right to health care um-hum and yet i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it and well that's the thing you know uh unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are are paying for the people that don't have health insurance which is why people are talking about we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair yeah i don't think you um you have health insurance through your company yes i do uh through my company yes but i have been in a situation uh recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year and my wife developed cancer and we didn't have any insurance oh my goodness and it was uh that must've been horrible go to Parkland type situation how was your care at Parkland uh because it was a life threatening situation it was very good uh as it as it turned out one of the top um people or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland but Camp Parkland is not free either no it's not free but uh is it affordable it's it's a situation that because i didn't have any insurance and i was on unemployment it was paid by the county so you did have a good experience i had a bad experience as it turned out um i was fortunate that there was Parkland is your wife better i hope uh no she passed away oh that's all right that happens i'm real sorry sure it does happen but it's very sad yeah but in any event um i'm in favor of national health well so am i actually um i'm a pediatrician and i feel very strongly about um children and um developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year if i had to vote for it oh is that right um-hum um-hum where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most so um i'm really quite active in trying to uh uh be proactive at least to for children's issues it's very complex very complicated but um i just strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization glasses hearing aids basic health benefits well i when i grew up and i grew up in south central Kansas um we had and my mom worked for the health department the county health department and we had X rays every year we had a dentist come to our school and uh check our teeth once a year at least um we had all our flu shots taken care of our measles mumps rubella and all that other stuff and uh when my children were growing up um we didn't have that we had to pay for it which i wasn't opposed to paying for it i had the money to pay for it but i'm sure that there were people that don't well and the costs of so much has gone up so much the cost of immunizations for example um and just the legal the legal benefits um that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily et cetera um-hum so well i don't know it's it is interesting in case you didn't know Texas leads the nation in uninsured children thirty one percent of all Texas children did not know that do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid so uh one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care and i work in the children's Parkland system and it's pretty overwhelming to me um-hum but um it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county  set okay you you got the topic right okay um well where in Dallas are you yeah i'm in Richardson oh okay so you do recycling do recycling there okay yeah Richardson has um well they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly if it's not raining um-hum and they also have a couple of areas where you can take uh cans plastic and paper to uh you know dump them off there if you don't uh want to wait and have a pick up least of paper but they don't pick up the other items they don't pick up cans or the plastic um-hum are they going to later or do you know i'm not sure they only started to do the newspaper uh late last year just try like a trial basis and see how it goes so i don't know if they're going to pick up the other things uh-huh hm well i'm i'm in Dallas proper in the city of Dallas and i know they do have you know a pilot program going on but it's not here what about you um-hum um so they're not picking up anything so i mean we we collect everything we've got all these boxes in our garage for you know green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything oh where do you take them but um well there's there's a couple places unfortunately we can't find a place that'll take everything hm um there's a lot of places to take like the plastic um shopping bags like most of the grocery stores and there's a Wal-Mart nearby that takes almost everything i can't remember what it is they don't take uh-huh uh-huh hm and the library will take glass so we end up you know on the weekend we pack it all in the car and and as we go places we oh wait we can drop the glass off you know drop things off one at a time oh but um and it's kind of disappointing i mean i would even be happy if they just had one you know one place where you could do everything you know it would still be more convenient than what we have now one of the people from my department i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the Dallas Shelter hm where is that i think that was closer to downtown uh she's not here anymore but uh yeah oh i'm pretty far north i'm not i'm i'm i'm just i'm north of Addison actually oh so i'm i'm really i'm sort i'm in Dallas but only technically yeah well sometimes we take our uh we we always keep our aluminum cans and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks uh-huh yeah yeah i've seen those you don't get too much money back i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there but normally i collect oh like three trash bags full yeah yep and i take them over to that can bank and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans in the can bank you don't get too much money for them but uh-huh well you get something yeah uh we used to do that but again that's another stop and it doesn't take plastic bags and and all that sort of thing but um um-hum i think that you know i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is and so hopefully they'll do it soon that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week um-hum uh-huh where i grew up we only had one a week and that was certainly sufficient so if they just do one of them will be trash and the alternate time would do recyclables that'd be great yeah yeah so i hope they do ah i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers you know i seem to put them out there on Wednesday and like sometimes they come by um-hum sometimes they don't i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that oh hm but i could certainly have uh three bins out there for you know plastic and and tin and paper whatever they were going to uh separate into and and have them pick it up on on one of the two days per week that would be easy right yeah do you have to um sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that that sort of thing or do they take the whole thing you're not supposed to have like the coupons in there oh okay um or you're not supposed to put magazines in there and you can't take newspapers now at work um-hum uh you know we have changed our recycling at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears you can throw it in there because at first they said let me guess you work at TI right yeah at first they said they said no telephone books so do i yeah you know that well that's stupid and then they said no newspapers well in the my department everybody gets the Wall Street Journal i know yeah there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it and say anything paper yeah well they and they take cans now too which is great yeah i still put my cans in with the cans i think i don't want it with paper somehow it just seems weird to me well our department used to collect the cans anyway for the Christmas tree project oh and in fact we got this past year we got all of our money for the Christmas tree because we saved cans for the entire year oh and it worked out really well well we had the the one person who used to take things to the Dallas Shelter i think that's what that was called uh-huh uh-huh she collected she used to collect from the whole department but she took them all down to that Dallas Shelter place um-hum i wish i could remember that whole name of that place but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter uh-huh um-hum uh yeah she used she used to collect them from everybody in the department she'd go up and down with her little bag collecting from everybody yeah yep yep because we would get it  okay all set then uh what do you think about it uh i think it's a real good concept uh drug testing procedures would have to be refined um-hum from what i've seen on the news there's a a a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy poor procedure in uh drug testing oh i didn't realize that yeah um there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their in their uh test but they didn't know for sure what it was but it was a drug so they got turned down and uh turns out it was a prescription or people getting somebody else's blood test um-hum same sort of problem that happens sometimes with these some of these uh like AIDS tests and such okay um-hum yeah that's right i have heard uh i don't remember what they call it sort of like a positive negatives or some some kind of word they use when a uh you get a uh a positive indication of drugs but there's not really there weren't really any there uh every now and then there's an error and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated yeah oh yeah yeah i i work here at Texas Instruments so uh we we do a let me think do we yeah everyone coming in i guess i did three years ago yeah yeah everyone coming in uh goes through the drug testing procedure and um-hum they talk about it as a you know as as better for the country and better for the working conditions uh yeah if they uh they test for drugs i i'm i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore i know we did in the military but i don't know if once your in they continue to do it but i guess you're always on call for it yeah yeah i not very long ago worked for Wal-Mart and about a year and a half ago they instituted a uh uh-huh a uh drug testing program uh well drug and alcohol testing program it's it's not a random through the system as each employee comes in um-hum uh-huh part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test um but and uh i think the big problem though is is they send these off to large labs in my uh-huh right and then they have thousands and thousands of the samples that uh going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up and things like that a potential for inaccuracy so your big beef with it is the uh is is it's a good idea but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better or make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever yeah i i i tend to agree with you David yeah yeah yeah my brother uh my brother used to work for Wal-Mart and then i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if Sam's is actually part of it but he you know is working at Sam's now yeah yeah Sam's is part of Wal-Mart okay yeah then he's been working for the company for a while too yeah he enjoys it good company um you all uh have some his yeah oh yeah the company i thought was a great place to work telling me about good profit sharing and all that so um-hum it's good news yeah they got to have had two or three years in with them then you start buying stock and you have a have a little taken out of your check each each payday to put against uh uh stock portfolio uh not portfolio just you know against Wal-Mart stock uh-huh um-hum but uh you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while yeah that's what my brother was telling me that's good good news good deal well uh how long were we supposed i haven't done this in a couple months how long were we supposed to discuss for uh you're supposed to get five minutes okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess uh think what else i can say about that um um do you have any idea uh let's see were you were you were tested for drugs as you got into uh as as you got into TI right um everyone coming in gets goes through the drug test yeah uh now uh were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through or uh no well let me think about that yeah it was after i was i had already been hired um yeah you get hired then you come in the first i oh okay seems to me i remember that uh i was hired came in and went through some orientation and i thought i boy i can't remember that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test maybe it was during the interview i came up a couple times for an interview so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened but uh i guess just like other companies other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around it's it's before they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment so i'm sure that happened to me too yeah yeah what what about oh they just instituted it there at Wal-Mart so yeah they they it was after i was already working there and they weren't testing any of those that were already working so right right yeah i wasn't  he likes them well uh the most i've done so far is like uh landscaping you know bushes and shrubs and stuff like that my wife likes to put out flowers and stuff in the flower beds so i'm always having to uh turn the flower beds for her every year she puts the flowers and i try to maintain the bushes and trees and stuff well i do vegetable gardening i rent a rotortiller once a year in January and turn everything and then i start putting stuff in in third week in January and there's stuff pretty much out there until the freeze hits whenever that is yeah um-hum so i usually start off with onions and garlic and then i put in beets hm uh-huh and then uh put out green beans red red red beets but you can eat the tops too oh i see and then i usually put out um some kind of spinach or some type of green like that and then in April is when the tomatoes and peppers and um-hum lima beans and black eyed peas and cucumbers and all that other good stuff goes out hm yeah uh each year i try something i've never tried before this year i'm trying a product called well it's called spaghetti basically it's a squash like product when you cook it oh yeah i've heard of that when you yeah i've never tried that before each year i try something new and so this is the one i'm gonna try see if it works down here uh-huh but my wife has rose bushes and she takes care of those uh i see i'd like to do a vegetable garden but i don't have the yard size for it i'm in a zero lot line home but uh we're thinking of moving this year the interest rates are getting so low we can't afford not to well you know the vegetable gardens don't have to be very big this plot i have is twenty two by eight so that's a hundred and seventy six square feet which is not very big and you know if you have crops in the early spring and then crops in the summer and crops in the fall on the same spot you can put a minimum of two different crops like where i have um um-hum um onions and garlic sometimes i'll put other things you know because the onions and garlics will mature in June or July um-hum yeah excuse me sure hm so how do your tomatoes tomatoes do down here pretty good oh they do real well i used the type called Better Boy really for several years which did well but it has not done well the last couple years so in this past year um-hum i tried a new crop called Celebrity hm and Celebrity gave me pretty much continuous tomatoes from the um first week in June until the freeze hit in November um-hum course i think a lot of it was due to the mild weather and the rain but i had tomatoes on the table every day for five months which is yeah wow that's pretty good in the in the past i usually got tomatoes for three four weeks and that would be it and then in the fall i'd you know get a couple more weeks but this is a very unusual year yeah uh you try fruit like uh strawberries and well we did have strawberries a few years ago but we don't do them anymore and we had a peach tree and it was too much hassle you have to spray it and uh um cover the fruit from the birds and all these other things and it just proved to be more hassle than it was worth um yeah so vegetables are much easier then vegetables are pretty easy i think fruit is has some difficulties of course any some vegetables are far more work than others the hard part is at the very beginning when you have to hm yeah set up the garden and get everything but once the plants get going and then it's just a matter of keeping the insects off yeah yeah well that sounds neat you ever do anything like melons no never done that no i remember one year at my parents' old house we grew a um i guess a pumpkin a squash plant you know turned out to be a pumpkin and uh it it bore pretty good size fruit and then one year we just let one of the squashes grow out it produced a really huge pumpkin we're pretty surprised and they just got lucky because they didn't do anything to it no fertilizing or anything just kind of threw the seeds out there but uh looks pretty neat yeah this was down in San Antonio so i don't know hm that's strange well you must've gotten lucky well the climate's a little better for that down there for hot weather i think so too i think so too i you know i noticed here in Dallas well maybe it depends on where you live but it's like the shrubs don't do as well they don't grow as fast well that's sometimes you have hot cold winters but we haven't had anything so far this year yeah yeah i've got a tree that i planted that doesn't it's okay but it doesn't you know my dad planted a tree two years after i planted mine and his is like three times as big as mine wow i don't know what it is i I think it is uh i have a feeling that the soil's not there's a lot of rocks in it must be the soil because all around me i can see where the erosion is from from the creek beds there's a lot of rock under me i have a feeling i'm i'm probably the roots are probably hitting rocks or something um it's hard for them to go once they have no dirt there yeah i try to keep it going but it's not getting very big i think in five years it grew like three or four feet maybe you need a i know i  what do you think well uh this is this is about drug testing right right well uh i'm i'm certainly under the uh uh the influence of the idea that that the government needs to have less control on what uh what the citizens do although i do see this as uh uh something that definitely needs to be taken care of whether that whether that should be put in the hands of the corporation or in the government or the hands of hands of the government is a you know a a different question i think as far as i'm concerned uh in a in other words i am favor in favor of drug control or or or drug testing um i was drug tested when i came to my job here at TI yet but but at the same time i don't think uh that should be governed by by the government uh per se i think it should be by more by the private institution um-hum how about you yeah i think they the corporations should uh do all that they should uh have drug screening before they hire an employee um-hum and uh anytime that an employee like if they're coming to late work all the time and uh and if they if they're especially if there's not on the line or any kind of sensitive job where uh-huh you know if they can if they made a mistake it would cost a lot of money or or people's lives then they need to be watched carefully so yeah sure uh-huh yeah i i agree with you i you know i would even think that um uh i could in theory take that alone a you know a step further and say anybody in any job you know if the corporation felt like uh and and this is why i mean uh drugs are the biggest problem i think to face America today i mean it's what drives crime it's what drives um-hum um uh any sort of of uh uh pain and discomfort in the world or in America i think it's somewhat it's somewhat um driven by drugs and i think that uh were corporations and uh private industry to take um take command in this situation that maybe maybe we might have some some control over that we you know if you can't work then you can't be a little bit harder to take take the drugs or whatever i don't know right course that might up crime you know and uh people go in and steal your television and steal and sell it just because they can't they can't work anymore you know yeah yeah but you got to have a a safe work place that's all there is to it definitely you're you're you're definitely right that you can't you can't have it any other way um-hum uh yeah you know whether whether in in the case that you brought up you know whether uh you know whether if it's a policeman and he's working with uh the public and he has a and has a gun in his holster or or even you know if it's a guy at McDonald's cooking a burger i think they're dangerous in either situation um-hum um i don't what what do you think um what percentage of of corporations and uh private industry do you think use uh drug testing i think it's it's more frequent now it's probably like forty fifty percent oh really uh-huh yeah because uh all the jobs that i've applied for have uh mentioned some type of drug screening yeah right yeah what kind of work are you in uh i work at Sears and i just do warehouse work uh-huh uh-huh and did they give you drug testing uh not they hired me in nineteen eighty four so yeah but now they they uh they issued a statement about that about three months ago oh okay uh-huh oh so are they going to uh begin spontaneous uh drug testing uh not that i know of it was more about uh all the people's problems like they've been laying off a lot of people and uh and uh uh-huh oh yeah they sent out uh employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem family problems you know it kind of covered everything sure uh-huh uh-huh but i know they have a lot of drug problems so yeah what do you think about um you know something that kind of concerns me is uh you you know you and i are tested for for whatever work we happen to do do you think there should be drug testing for political officials yes i do because because a lot of them are you know they're hypocritical they they talk against drugs and then they get caught you know yeah i do too yeah uh-huh in stings in Washington whether it's drugs or any other kind of uh like the the money laundering scams all that was drug related so yeah oh yeah and that cost us the country you know billions of dollars sure sure yeah i would agree with you i i can't see i can't see how we can expect the you know uh uh so people working in the in in America to um uh to put any trust into our political officials if they don't you know uh it just doesn't make sense to have them it it to to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves  okay well considering you moved here from California i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you would have down there yeah oh yeah we have um in California i'm in central i lived in central California we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know it'd be maybe October and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain especially the last few years so yeah yeah it's kind of has it's kind of been a drought out there hasn't it uh yeah there has so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year that's what i was thinking yet generally if we're gonna get them it's not going to happen uh prior to January one you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in December but yeah yet still could come huh uh-huh yeah usually the bitterest weather if we're gonna have any comes in January and February then by March things are getting warm again so we really don't have as long a cold season i guess as people up north hm yeah yeah it's so hard to predict here it's been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before lots of times yeah well today it's not bad out there no it's nice i just came in from outside and it's it's really pretty it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out um-hum yeah before it rains again i'm a i'm a scoutmaster and so i wind up going out camping with yeah uh a bunch of boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasn't been just totally wet before we go uh-huh yeah so you do that even in January huh uh-huh oh yeah yeah we camp year round yeah oh that's interesting but uh it's uh it's definitely different and then i guess you've been through a couple of summers here too right um-hum yeah yep and they're not too pleasant it gets so humid to me it's humid here people that i know that come from um like Georgia or North Carolina yeah they say this isn't humid well it is it's not as humid as Houston say or Atlanta but it yeah but i find it humid its more humid than Arizona and California for the most part right were you northern California yeah i was central California Central Valley so it's very dry there central okay so that was dry but pretty even climate wasn't it year round fairly not wide fluctuations yeah yeah well it's pretty hot in the summer it's in the usually you know for a good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but it's a dry heat yeah but it's a drier hundred when you have a hundred here everybody's dying uh-huh yeah i know huh well i lived in Africa for a couple years in oh Cameroon and that's a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something no i was um working with um i still work with Wycliffe Bible Translators oh it's an organization where we are looking to translate the Bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages right languages that don't have anything written yet so this is like the first thing that's written down or you know first an alphabet is developed and then um oh that's interesting you don't think about that as a career a normal career uh when you're thinking of things that people might be doing so yeah yeah well it's based here um the international headquarters for Wycliffe Bible Translators is right here in in Dallas oh so you're you're with the home office now yeah right now i am so that's what brought me here yeah well the uh i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh the weather yeah you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but there's an awful lot of good weather too in between yeah i agree i agree i i thought the fall was really nice yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that uh-huh yeah uh-huh particularly if i'm gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and that's nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that um-hum yeah and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting uh-huh think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so um-hum i guess we'll the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains there's not much between us and the North Pole and then when you get one of those tornado type um-hum yeah um-hum systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it it doen't seem to be  what do you how what do you think of your news coverage and where do you get most of it uh usually uh either TV or radio oh oh it it seems like uh-huh sometime uh we get the weekend paper but uh even then it just seems that sometimes you're so busy you don't wanna take an hour or so to sit down the paper um-hum so it's so much quicker just to hear you know hear it on the radio or watch TV yes we don't go to bed at night usually until we've seen the news at ten so that's probably well we do take a daily paper too uh-huh oh you do uh-huh um-hum but it's out of Ogden and so it it's not very you know it's not probably as big as yours and sometimes i wonder about the newspaper coverages too anyway yeah oh yeah because i've known stories that have happened and then read it in the paper and it hasn't been all that accurate um-hum um-hum not quite the same yeah and a lot of times when you have two different um papers you get two different stories that's true although i think that's the same on TV too you know you'll get one you know one day and one the next day on the same thing and so but i yeah right oh excuse me i enjoy i enjoy the news i like to keep up on whatever's happening oh i do too so it's just it's so much easier just to you know listen to the radio in your car it seems like or just to sit down for a short while and watch the news than it is to sit down and you know i mean i'll read periodicals and stuff too but um um-hum usually those come out after the fact and course they give you more information so if you want that then that's fine uh yeah well i think sometimes you know you'll hear it on TV and you want want to go into it deeper you uh you can get it in a magazine or a paper right right a newspaper and then on the radio you know they usually uh give the news every hour yeah uh-huh and so i i like that too especially when we're traveling right yeah i know that when i'm on vacation i am like seems like i'm totally out of it i don't know what's going on and i don't really care so well that's true too it's kind of nice to get away from it all yeah uh-huh but you know if there's a story that you're particularly interested in it's good to to be able to follow up on it you know so right yeah but uh we have a a news station too that is uh KSL out of Salt Lake that covers just it's a talk show and there's news almost constantly on it oh uh-huh and then CNN has news constantly too right right so do you have cable no we don't so we don't watch CNN oh oh well we couldn't get TV here if we didn't have cable we live close to the mountain oh okay and uh the signal the signal doesn't come because we're kind of behind a mountain right right so we couldn't get it if we didn't have cable cable in fact we've when we first moved out here for the first probably twenty years we couldn't it was really snowy oh is that right our reception and you know we'd watch it and the kids would watch it but it wasn't all that good uh-huh so so you figured might as well get the cable huh yeah well we were glad when it came but it just keeps going up in price too so that's kind of detriment too right but we've thought of getting a satellite so that we could get more stations but uh it wouldn't i don't know now that'll be nice yeah but i don't think we're gonna to do it because it's uh you can't get local stations and that's the news that we're mostly interested in uh-huh right yeah and back to news flash from our high school today we have one high school in town and they had to evacuate it because the furnace was acting up and was threatening to blow up oh is that right i bet the kids were happy yeah they i think they were yeah well we had uh i don't know if your son told you but we had two papers here in Dallas and now we just have the one we saw it on TV before he told us oh okay so that'll probably make a difference in the reporting yeah does uh how much does your newspapers cost they are um on the weekends gosh um let me see i've got this on Sunday it's a dollar um-hum and during the week i'm not really sure how much it is it's probably i guess you know seventy five cents or so i would think um-hum ours is eight dollars a month so how would that figure up with what you'd do uh-huh but you get it every day don't you oh so that's that's really good then yes yes it's kind of a skinny newspaper except when the ads you know like at Christmas time or Thanksgiving or right so it's uh but we i enjoy it i'd hate to be without a newspaper and then we get the local you know the little Brigham City one it's uh comes once a week uh-huh yeah that must uh do you have a hard time keeping up with it reading everything keep no oh well that's good no but  okay um some of the TV shows i like to watch are um mostly evening evening shows and uh like for instance the one i'm looking forward to to tonight is Twenty Twenty i usually watch those prime time programs right uh i like to watch Forty Eight Hours never miss that and uh sometimes Prime Time Live um and then the week goes by and i don't think ever watch anything else you know the the Sunday night movies i watch those kind of things but uh mostly but basically a lot of documentary things and you know what's going on and that kind of thing i like i have a few you know favorite shows that i try not to miss L A Law is one of them although this year's uh-huh uh-huh it's a little easier to miss than last year with the new cast and everything and yeah yeah it's hard to follow right and uh i like Rosie O'Neil oh i've never seen that one The Trials of Rosie O'Neil with Sharon Gleese okay yeah i've seen a uh the previews for that she it's very good it it's probably very much a woman's movie uh show uh-huh but uh and then there's a new sitcom on that is Tim Allen's uh what is it uh Handyman that's not what uh Home Improvement oh we never miss that or we try not to miss that it's hysterical isn't it did you catch the Christmas oh we think it is so funny oh i just part of it i thought it was you know and it had such a good story too did you see the end of it uh-huh no well you know the little boy the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus uh-huh oh that's right and the neighbor they thought it was the neighbor they thought it was the neighbor and he gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip yeah yeah i thought that was wonderful and then uh it it's it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor and uh on Sunday used to be on Sunday nights now i can't figure out where they've moved it on our uh public television they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show um-hum and it showed the latest uh developments from all the computer companies uh-huh i've never seen that program well you know it's unless you're really into computers you wouldn't and software you probably wouldn't be interested but uh-huh uh-huh i don't know it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there oh and uh you know what uh they they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets you know and then they also the hardware oh uh-huh so you you could see what the new developments were and what to look for and um-hum i enjoyed that it was just a thirty minute show with no commercials oh okay it's public television course doesn't have the commercials during the show so yeah right and i like the Frugal Gourmet oh i do too oh i do too uh but i just seem to to miss a lot of these programs i don't know why i just i if i can catch them i do or if i remember well there's very few that you know my life would stop if i didn't catch but uh now i do before i go to work i tape my soap opera oh yeah i watch one and well i watch two but one's a half hour and one's an hour and and they lead into each other oh and that's The Bold and the Beautiful and As the World Turns oh okay and i've watched the As the World Turns since i was a little girl yeah that's been on for years so it's just you know it's it's something i've done for the last probably twenty five years oh and so you get to come home and watch them yes and i don't have anyone else at home so i have freedom to watch whatever i want yeah uh-huh uh-huh but i like i like every i like the uh the information shows and i like the comedies and you know and i i do like good movies i prescribed subscribe to H B O uh-huh yeah well we so i can get some of the movies yeah that's a good idea we did have H B O but it we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious you know it's just it is but i don't sleep a whole lot and i you know at two o'clock in the morning there isn't anything on regular TV and oh and uh so that's and oh yes if you're up then you don't get good reception without cable and it doesn't cost that much more to have one of the pay channels so yeah right right that's primarily why i have it right now yeah yeah i i thought when i got my V C R i'd probably drop it you know but that was years  hello yes i forgot we had to hit one or our time will be up well i hit one and nothing happened what's going on well just go ahead and talk that's all are you sure don't they usually tell you to say something yeah i don't think so huh-uh oh okay we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden yes i'm i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn and garden what do i do well i uh i cut it occasionally is uh is that good okay uh-huh good uh-huh you're ahead of me that's better and i edge it occasionally oh that's really good yeah see am i good or what yes and uh i uh much much beyond that i don't do i don't do any of that really well i call my lawn man Eric whatever his name is i can't remember who's gonna come and build me a fence too uh-huh oh he is gonna through fence well he's gonna give me an estimate and for ten dollars a week i don't see any reason for me to be doing it uh-huh what for a fence no for my yard oh well i thought isn't he the same one yeah he is yeah yeah but ten dollars or what is what does he charge not even that what does he charge me it's like next to nothing it's ten because i it's forty a month but if there's five weeks i still pay forty what am i i don't know yeah yeah but you know you ought to get him to go pull the weeds well he won't pull weeds he says he'll spray them but he won't pull them oh uh he won't cut them is what he won't do because he said with the rocks that it's too dangerous for him to take the um-hum yeah the trimmer over the rocks and he's right that's true but he just says to keep spraying them so uh-huh yeah well so anyway Gene sprayed them once or twice for me so yeah so you haven't you haven't pulled any weeds lately that was free no no there are two out front i thought i'd grab one of these days but i haven't bothered as i walk on by yeah i start to pull the weeds in the rocks out front and uh-huh all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds and there was dog dirt in it oh oh goody and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there and i left the whole thing and that was about a month ago i thought you were going to say there i thought you gonna say there was a snake in the weeds i would rather a snake oh God oh no i just left the whole thing the bag is still out there because i haven't touched it i haven't gone back over there it really made me mad yeah oh God so anyway but but uh how are your your flowers your little things you planted did they die or what oh yeah now they died oh they're all so they oh are they going to come back in the spring i don't know oh i don't know and then i got some nice uh mums at Thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather uh-huh yeah they looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas then they started to die too oh so i don't think any of it comes back but i don't know maybe sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to yeah i don't know uh so those flowers remember those little ones you gave me yeah yeah well they're i know they were still blooming up until about a a few weeks ago really yeah well that's good they're the best kind they they're like indestructible yeah they they're really pretty they really grow nice and sometimes they're not supposed to come back but lots of times they do uh-huh so yeah we'll see they're letting us have a lot of time on this aren't they but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time yeah i mean isn't it supposed to be five minutes we didn't disconnect did we i hope not neither one of us is getting paid for this oh i hate to think i hate to think i'd be talking to you without getting paid yeah really i know it i can't believe this i got somebody from Utah what uh-huh and somebody where was the person last night was from far away you're kidding really and we get each other down the street this is so funny well uh the uh i got i talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas and that was it yeah i've had Dallas Arlington i've had uh one Plano uh-huh and then a lady from Brigham Utah whose son lives in Plano on Ranier someplace wow really and then um another state i can't remember but she told me about the Utah Jazz we talked about basketball oh really and i don't remember what what the place was last night like i'm thinking Colorado but i'm not sure another place anyway yeah uh-huh so the but mostly they're from the area this i don't know this yeah well there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes not for me either what do i not for me you know not not for me because all i have is rocks and weeds yeah but i don't you know i what do i do cut it one you know and and edge it and that's about it what do i do with it i know i know we're not typical Texans no but what's going on are they gonna tell us to stop stop or what well i don't know i hope so come on come on isn't it five minutes i don't know i i mean i'm all talked out about gardens i know well we can talk about something else it's just a suggested topic oh oh it's just suggested so how's the baby do you think how's the let's talk about the baby what we could talk let's talk about the baby  Wendy how'd you like to start off and well um they said talk about um gee oh heavens everyday occurrences that that annoy you okay i don't mind these phone calls but i hate the uh sales calls uh-huh but and what about you um for an invasion of privacy i feel like uh when i use write a check then they want my driver's license and they write down my number or or when i use my Visa card they want my phone number and they put that into their computer then they can look up yeah and they look up where i live and uh then they mail me stuff and they can sell it sure get all sides yep all kinds of demographics just from that info and anymore you know uh you don't have to give out your well you know how they used to ask for if you wrote a check they would ask for your credit card number but they can't do that anymore or at least you're not legally um you know have to give it to them you know what uh we have is we've got our credit card number on our uh guarantee card so they have to write down what's a guarantee card it's a card that says this check is good for up to a hundred bucks to the merchant oh i don't i i we don't use that that i know of here on ours it's just on the back of our Visa and it says guarantee oh uh-huh and you might wanna check out your Visa it might have one that on there already okay uh so do you but particularly what i was speaking of are the telemarketing phone calls you know at odd hours that i get yeah buy computers well and not necessarily computers you know it can be the people sometimes the people are worse than the computers because you can just hang up on the computer but the person you know will do anything to keep you on the line yes and um you know i i i don't like to be rude to people but i find myself becoming more and more um abrasive because i just don't you know feel like they should be calling me on my own personal private time what do you think about that uh caller ID when you call in like on an eight hundred number or something or uh to buy something and then they know who you are and uh where you're calling from and your address and all that and well i have to say that you know if you're going to do it then you have to realize the consequences but see most people don't know that that information's recorded yeah well i i i i suppose that's true but i know that you know whenever you're giving that kind of information out particularly when you're buying something you know your name automatically goes on a list which is sold sold to a hundred other companies yep you seem well informed well i've i i've studied advertising in college and that um you know that's one of the areas i suppose that we covered but i i i would never do telemarketing as a job i can't stand rejection no that's kind of a a bummer i'm looking forward to the time when uh my phone at home can tell me who's calling yeah that would be nice and then i don't answer it if i don't wanna talk to you i suppose the day will come i yeah well any others that you can think of we'll see another invasion of privacy uh everyday occurrence i can't well i mean unless you go to the extremes like uh people coming up to you i had this lady come to me in the mall and said jeez you look just lovely i just wanted to tell you that by the way i'm a Mary Kay representative and here's my business card can i set you up for a facial and i mean i was shopping for Christmas presents in the mall and i found i found her tactics extremely rude because she was preying on my uh you know uh everybody's self esteem you know gee somebody thinks i'm pretty you know sure and gosh they wanna tell me i look great that's right by the way here's my business card let me set you up for a facial and get you to spend fifty bucks you know as a consumer we have to be wary of all that type of propaganda exactly and i was very flattered until she told me she the company she was with oh what a bummer that would be a kind of a deflator yeah she goes to everybody in the mall and says the same thing so i wasn't too flattered let's see i took something back to one of the stores today a Christmas gift and uh i had to show my ID and uh blood type and because i didn't have a sales slip and it was interesting oh what a bummer did you even have the tag on the item yeah uh uh no so they were particularly uh well uncooperative they were and uh i guess the time to do it i talked to the with the guys at work is right after Christmas because they're too busy to give you a rush yeah they're so swamped they let you get by yeah well i don't have anything else to say i think we've covered it well it's been a pleasure Wendy bye and you too bye-bye  all right now then we should be ready to go with our conversation all right what are your preferences i think i tend to prefer ethnic restaurants rather than steak houses or uh simply American food or or even the southwest food uh frequently we enjoy trying a a new kind of a place and to try to see what their style of food is and what kind of spices and things they use in it so that's what me we mostly do what do you prefer when you go out oh i've decided there's so many places in Dallas i will not make too many repeats and i thoroughly enjoy the ethnic foods oh you do yes certainly course i perhaps would enjoy Tex-Mex and that's uh a good Tex-Mex is awfully hard to beat do you prefer do you care for that flavor oh yes really very much um i think that the Tex-Mex food has become a kind of a a standard enjoyed food in our home and i've even learned to make a a few things at home myself and that's why i said sometimes when we go out i would not because i don't like it but because we we tend to like it and even have it at home i'd rather try something else um-hum yeah uh-huh i i i understand that uh but you don't care for the steaks i'm not a big steak or rib or um roast beef eater although to be honest with you at holiday time at Christmas i always buy a a standing prime rib and make some Yorkshire pudding and gravy and totally enjoy it and then can table that for six months to eight months to another year so uh yeah uh and you know we're trying not to eat those those big meats also with all of that health consciousness uh believe me we're not fanatics in that line but uh if we enjoy other things then we'll we'll tend to go that way a nice Chinese once in a while is is very tasty and um we recently went to an Ethiopian restaurant and uh sampled that kind of food rather different but uh have you been to any place lately that you enjoyed yes i found a little place over in uh Preston Center tonight it's uh called oh i don't have the matches now but it's a its a um-hum Cafe au France and they had the it's a small place but most delightful i had not been there before oh oh my and then i found with a neighbor oh couple a about a month ago this uh Salvadorian oh and that is on Six Thirty Five in a i don't think it was Day's Inn Motel but this woman's son had been there two or three times and their food is excellent um-hum is that right except for their fried banana now i do not care for that oh oh my uh-huh but uh the the other things the seasonings were so appealing um-hum um-hum oh wait i have a call just a second okay go ahead i'm sorry i didn't know i'd have that one come in but anyway that okay that was it was very good and very very reasonable oh good good service and the things that i look forward to i mean i want to be waited on i don't want to go cafeteria style right um-hum i'd rather have them cater to me when i'm when i'm patronizing them and um-hum when you go out i um-hum i don't blame you i i think that's an important part of relaxing that you don't have to do the work yourself um-hum the only time that i would go against that is would be the Sunday brunches that so many of the places have oh do you have a preference to a place for Sunday brunch one that i have enjoyed and had the privilege of eating there New Year's Eve night was the Marriott on Six Thirty Five at Coit oh yes i'm familiar with that um-hum have you been there to eat well i have not really been there to have the brunch um-hum well they had a buffet dinner which was very similar  what kind of home is yours pretty similar to the ones around you or well i think so i mean is it we live in a neighborhood where you know the none of the homes are exactly exactly alike um-hum our home's a two story home and oh there's about half and half in our neighborhood that are ramblers that are two stories uh-huh is yours a split entry no no it's just a no it's a it's a regular two story all the bedrooms are upstairs and the and everything else is downstairs the basement is oh oh unfinished now you you live in Mantua don't you right yes uh we live in a ours is a little um oh ours the street is fairly new in fact we were the very first home on the street and we've lived here almost nine years oh is that right yes and so we were we were the first one and um and i we don't have a garage or and the and the basement is not finished in fact we're just trying to review our options right now and decide whether we want to finish the basement and add on a garage or whether we're going to find something else or oh gee we're just growing out of it did you build the house yes yes we did it it was new and um uh-huh there's a variety of of homes along our street in fact next door to us is a log cabin home oh really yes and it's it's just beautiful inside it's do you like it i do but if i think if i had a log cabin i'd want it to be uh-huh a cabin type home rather than a oh rather than your personal residence yeah rather than something i went to every day and i and i would want it on a different setting than you know a row of houses it's something yeah it's beautiful inside but it to me it looks just a bit out of place yeah we've got a person that wants to build a log cabin in this neighborhood and we have some uh protective covenants oh oh yes and they've really got into kind of some well it's kind of been a messy situation it's oh actually gotten down to lawsuits and these are people that are you know oh has it in oh that's see each other every Sunday at church and then they're suing each other it's not it's not a good situation oh dear oh dear now why did they want to build a log they just that's what they prefer huh well it's it's a a single gal that uh well she's divorced and oh uh think they have they're pretty actually uh good price per square foot uh-huh and uh think she's thinking that would be a good economical way to get a get the home that she likes at oh oh that's yeah because apparently they save quite a bit when you put them together from the kit or or however they come yeah i i'm not sure it's it's been a really controversy a controversy oh dear so is she going to be able to build to build it do you think not so far no because the the restrictive covenants provide to the not so far one of the uh covenants is uh curiously enough uh that it has to be in harmony with the existing structures oh so when the you know when the copy it doesn't look like the other homes it kind that's one thing item that has to occur in our neighborhood right huh well that is interesting we have to have uh a lot of uh if you don't have uh brick on it for example they're a little bit hard on you um-hum oh yeah like you have a certain amount brick and a certain amount uh some other material siding or does it have to be uh a certain square footage or a certain price stucco uh i think there is a minimum square footage i'm not sure what it is is there oh we've we've been looking around at different pieces of land and have found a a couple that that had the minimum square footage oh uh-huh you know requirement but um huh that's interesting that the other houses along our road are like you say some are ramblers and some are the two story so uh-huh but ours ours is the smallest one on the road ours is you know our subdivision is really only about seventy homes so oh and uh our street is uh the nicest homes are on our street i will say that not uh being boastful but i think our street does have the nicer homes uh-huh yeah well that's good we border uh well just on the other side the houses across our street uh from ours are the probably the nicer homes because they border on the golf course and they have a creek that runs through their backyard oh oh oh that's nice yeah but uh that is nice now did you build you built yours uh-huh yeah we've been in it six years oh oh did you do the contracting yourself or did you hire a contractor or and uh we had a contractor come and do that uh oh i really don't know much about home construction i well i know a little bit i did a little bit of work in summer in summer sometimes just doing some framing but uh-huh uh-huh i don't know when you got a full time job and a family you really don't have the time that's right it takes it takes did you finish your basement yourself or no i haven't finished it yet oh you haven't finished it but see our upstairs has four bedrooms oh you don't need it yet then do you we we really haven't had occasion to to to need it so to need it  start first sure i guess i'm trying to think do we pay too much taxes uh uh well i it it certainly seems like it i don't know you know i i i'm not up in the uh in in the high end brackets myself and so uh-huh i can just imagine how bad that would hurt i remember at one point when my dad was paying uh nearly nearly sixty percent tax tax bracket and that was just you know uh-huh it was killing him yeah and i think that's that's basically my standpoint too is my dad and i've talked about this a lot and i just personally i think it's kind of i don't know we pay a lot um sometimes i I know that it's not used very wisely and i think the big thing for me and what my dad has said is we pay a lot but it's worth it to live in America i guess for our freedom yeah uh i mean other places pay more and you know so you can look at some place like Sweden and you know they they almost all give like seventy percent of their income to the government uh-huh right um they get some different things out of it though uh i don't know i i'm not i'm not terribly pleased with the distribution of of of it and i think we we spend entirely too much on defense uh-huh right um although i work in in sort of hi tech industry type thing and and and which in large part survives on on uh on defense contracting you know so um-hum so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna sorry cutting it hard but um i don't know you know it seems like it seems like we ought to be able to get a little bit uh things ought to be a little bit more efficiently run and i i i and i think that we could get by without continually raising taxes yeah absolutely you know i mean i think i think we're at a point where you know it's it's taxes are a burden but their you know um services come out of it and and things are important but on the other hand right you know they just can't continue to rise forever and the deficit can't continue to grow yeah you know there's there's got to be some point where people sit down and say okay you know this is enough income to give government services at and we need to make sure we give good government service at this point and you know and um-hum and the sad thing i think personally you know i don't mind paying so much taxes if i'm getting what's due um-hum but i think a lot of times what happens is you get into the government system and my dad works for the government in some ways and he works a lot with people who are paid by the government and there are so many things to quote unquote protect the employee um-hum yeah that you know you're you're you're not getting what you're paying for a lot of times whereas in any other business situation it'd be see you you know right right you know there there there isn't there isn't the business cycle where where where government gets uh gets chopped down you know i mean and they they don't go through a restructuring you you know even IBM going through a cutbacks right and and you know government just doesn't do it yeah you know and and and and it's because of in part you know necessary protections for the worker right but but on the other hand there's you know you you you've got to plan them in the real world also you know yeah and you got to walk that fine line i think one of the things that the government really could could save a lot of money on is is you know when it's for example in defense spending when it's something that you can use like an ashtray you know um-hum just go buy it at a store my gosh and or buy it from a manufacturer instead of having it made and have to form the mold and everything you know yeah yeah right and granted there's other things for example that you know a microwave or something if you're underwater you'd have to have some specific specifications but um-hum but just to work out with our tax money you know watch where is it going to be best used and how is it going to be most effective cost wise yeah right yeah i mean i think i think you you know in general i'm i'm pretty pleased with the government with you know with America and and a lot of the things that work here i mean oh yeah it there there's lots of things that don't quite work right and um but if you've ever spent any time in other countries you realize um-hum that that its all a relative issue issue you know everywhere everywhere things don't work right and some places they really don't work right and here they they pretty much work right you know yep yeah um but i think you know i mean if if things are gonna things that need to change are things that that need to be sort of restructuring you know maybe market orientation a little bit more and and things like what you're talking about um right um-hum you know putting a little bit more of the pressures of the of the business pressures that are normal that are on everybody else on the government and uh so that we get a little bit more out of the tax dollars and a little bit right yeah and i agree with you there i think you know there there's nothing in my opinion from what i've seen and the people i've worked with some other countries and from our own country that that would ever take the place of the freedoms and the the the things that we have here for me i you know i i guess when it comes right down to it if it was living in a place um like Mexico or Russia that are really struggling both with the government and with economics i would prefer to pay my extra tax money here and um-hum yeah and have things the way they are yeah i i think my my wife's from Brazil and i've spent a fair amount of time there and and you wanna see a government system that just doesn't work you know i mean it's just its incredible its just entirely corrupt they have uh you know something like uh seventy five percent or sixty five percent of the able bodied workers are employed by the government uh-huh yeah you know and so that leaves everybody else you know this other small  what kind of a house do you live in is it typical of the area the uh house i live in is fairly typical of the area it's one that uh my wife and i designed ourselves how neat and we've been living in it now for thirty years so it must be okay oh we moved into our home about thirty three years ago and at the time it was a small ranch style it had two bedrooms on the main floor and then the basement wasn't finished but we have since finished the basement we've added a car port and we've added a big family room well in Texas we don't have basements very often i'm surprised you do in Utah oh most most i would think most of the homes in Utah do we live uh up against up by the mountains so it's cold yes we got about uh three inches of snow last night the snow plows have been out and my husband's been out shoveling the snow ah so uh but ours is is typical for the neighborhood but it is it air-conditioned no i have arthritis so you're cool enough you don't need the air-conditioning no in the summer time for about oh a month we could use air-conditioning but i have arthritis and i don't i don't like air-conditioning uh but we well in Texas you can't hardly live without it i know i've been to my son's in August and i hated it yeah we designed our house so the western exposure has a minimum number of windows so that the air-conditioning bill will be cheaper uh-huh oh we had uh we have had six children and so our house was small to start with but uh we added three basement three bedrooms in the basement and like i say added on to it so uh it's pretty typical did you have help designing it or was that part of what you do no actually uh it we we just started and we didn't like any of the houses we saw uh built they tended to have at the time we were building very large uh bathrooms which i consider a waste of space since you spend so little time in the bathroom uh-huh and uh also too much hall uh space we saw a home plan in Better Homes and Gardens about five years before we built this house that we liked except uh we wanted it a little bigger than uh uh it had two bedrooms that you could add on another bedroom uh-huh and we wanted it arranged slightly differently i think if you looked at the floor plan now uh you probably wouldn't recognize where we started from that's kind of the way ours is too but uh my wife likes a lot of cabinets in the kitchen and the original architect tried to talk us out of that and thank goodness we didn't let him talk us out of that um-hum uh-huh and uh we wanted an entry way so that the living room did not have to be walked through uh-huh the previous place we had lived in you always walked through the living room to get any place in the house and it was a traffic flow problem all the time uh-huh uh-huh so we have an entry way and i uh spend quite a little time in uh both when i was working and also even now retired in the study where i have a computer so we wanted a separate study and we have that um-hum and it has uh three bedrooms and we wanted it since our son we raised my wife's sister as our daughter so in effect we had two children but uh uh-huh we wanted it so that we could leave the house to them uh when they had friends over and the normal noise that goes with such things so we have the right master bedroom is arranged so that it is basically basically a separate apartment in itself it has its own bath has its own patio porch type thing sliding doors and a very large room with uh-huh a TV set so you could live back there by itself if you wanted to uh uh-huh uh that sounds lovely i've always wanted uh another bedroom upstairs and then i we've never had a bathroom off the master bedroom and i would like that oh that's i don't know uh with our previous house didn't have it and uh now that we've got it we we think we couldn't live without it you know yes well those are two things that i would definitely i would add another bedroom on the main floor i quilt a lot but yeah my wife does also oh does she yeah and now with the kids gone well she has a room reserved for her junk and i have one for my junk you know well that would be the way to go yeah uh but like i say our children live a long way away and so our family room i quilt in there a lot um-hum it's big enough that uh we it was eighteen by twenty when we added it on right so uh it's big enough for that but  well would you like to go first or shall i well as a science teacher i been encouraging recycling for a long time and uh we collect things at school such as foil we have different communities and cans and glass to a certain extent uh i coach an OM team and we save everything the kids at school bring some things in but not as much as i'd like and i have recyclings bins at home uh-huh and we've had a uh we save foil which i think a lot of people don't realize they could sell along with the aluminum i mean aluminum cans i think it's true yeah and and there are some areas where i believe they limit it they want you to just strictly go with the cans because of the different content but i think you're right the more often you can well Reynold's aluminum has this big balls of foil competition thing going and i don't know where we're supposed to turn it in another science teacher at school is in charge of that and got all the materials on it but we're saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room that's great do you have um curbside pickup in your community as well not yet it it is in some communities but it isn't here and it is experimental in some areas at this point they're trying it out and deciding what what they're gonna do with it um-hum we just started it this year and it's really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local dump and you know take your recyclables i know that i am much more motivated when i know that they'll come pick it up because there can be so much that you load in your car as to as to when i had to get that's true my husband gets irritated sometimes because of the even though i bought recycling bins um-hum and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain um um-hum oh it is and it's dirty and yeah and uh sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans often times there's a long line uh you know if it's one of those where you get change for your cans uh-huh uh-huh now if it's just a donation type of thing like at the library or some places like that sometimes people'll just dump their stuff at right at the front they don't go to the back of the oh like if it's a truck or whatever for paper yeah and then everything's just starts getting piled outside which is a pain because that's not what's supposed to be happening right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well the one thing that they don't recycle uh pick up they actually don't care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they don't pick up are the plastic goods you know um those big milk tubs and that constitutes a big portion of our trash so i would hope at some point those things would either um-hum that's true stop being manufactured or that that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically some of them are recyclable and i started trying to save those but we couldn't find a place to dump them right yes and so we just had to throw them away um they say on the cans or on the not the cans but the um the containers in fact that they are recyclable but i've i'm the same with you i haven't been able to at least not convenience probably outside the city limits or something well i think i was talking to someone who lives really almost on the other side of town said she knew of one place where you could go and so once a month they made this trek with all their recyclables but they also have a pickup uh and and they would take everything but that is it used to be such a pain and it's so far away from us and that's the only one she knew of um-hum you have to be motivated to do that when you're that far away after a point so i i guess what we've decided is that we're doing our part by recycling three and going out of our area way but to have to go clear across town for plastic because yeah well the fact that you're doing it at school with the with the kids is a great idea too because then they're also encouraged to learn about how to do that and there's a a little booklet called uh Fifty Things Fifty Ways You Can Save The Earth have you read that oh uh-huh i like that yes uh-huh yes well i read some of those to the kids from time to time so that they get some of the ideas uh from that but they are a lot more into recycling than they used to be um um-hum the children the the children uh-huh because i teach middle school oh is that the kids that you teach uh-huh and it's uh surprising some of them aren't but that probably goes right into their families but there are even groups of parents that are Recycling Coalition type deal where they're really making speeches to the PTA and the Dad's Club and everything trying to get more parents involved um um-hum so it's um that's great it it's on its way if we could get more support through the public utilities um-hum and i think when the government the local or the the state government attends to support it the more happens i know that in our hospital i work in a hospital i'm a therapist and just about three years ago when we started recycling everything um they not only recognized that they could save money with all  you keep a budget um yes i do okay how how do you work that well usually it works out pretty well does it um i try to project out um right now i project out six months oh you know i have my fixed monthly bills and i know how much they are right uh-huh and uh i have a percentage of my savings that i attempt to take off the top oh not unless i have something come up that's unusual that i was unexpected and then i may have to go into savings uh-huh oh and well that seems to work out pretty good kind of the formula i use i use uh ninety percent of my check oh and then i retain ten percent and if i don't use it then it goes into savings also for savings oh is it is it hard to set it up for the six month period rather than just a month or well my monthly bills are pretty consistent you know you have your house payments the same every month uh car payments are the same you know when your insurance is due oh right uh-huh so in fact so you budget all that in that's why a lot of times i only use ninety percent of my salary because some months i'll have insurance it might uh-huh um two or three times a year right and i need that extra money and to take it out of savings at that point oh so really when you're doing it it probably is just as easy to do it for the six month period rather than just a month at a time oh sure um-hum a month at a time is not a really a big picture of what's going on in your life because it doesn't give you any flexibility as far as uh unforeseen situations or something coming down the road that you know is coming down the road that you need to save for no uh-huh oh right and then also i mean that's if you do it monthly that's twelve times you have to sit down and figure it out and you could save all that yeah i do it uh twice a year and um you know i could adjust it every month that's no big deal uh-huh uh-huh but uh i just finished out December and uh when i was done with it i threw it away and i already had January through July made out um-hum so you do it January to July and then July to December oh oh does now how did you say you worked your savings do you take your savings right off um-hum yeah i take the savings right off the top i pay myself first uh-huh i'm the type of individual that uh you know i can't i have to put something back for myself to feel like i'm doing my job uh-huh right right it's my motivator and how much at what percentage do you save i save about fifteen percent oh that's great out of what out of my savings account not as well as the Japanese do well that that's fairly good do you get paid once a month or by twice a month twice a month uh uh actually every other week so twenty six checks every two weeks during the year oh that's great we yeah so twice a year i pick up an extra check also oh that's right so that helps out uh-huh gives you a bit there oh how do you all do yours well we we don't really do very well we have never sat down and made out a formal budget we keep saying you know we're going to do this we're going to do this we we take our savings right out right out first and put you know put it away and then um-hum we just uh we're that's terrible but we just kind of spend what we need that's right that's right we take the savings out and uh you know put that in and then spend what's left over huh spend what what's left over like you said and i know we if we keep but we just don't know how to get down and get started i guess trying to decide how much goes where and you know um-hum there's really no certain formula that you can say well i i wanna say this much and i'm gonna spend this much for the house and uh-huh uh i'm kind of in a situation right now that my our children are grown and they're gone so uh oh you know and the house is almost paid for so we're in pretty good shape oh oh that's great now how did you get started when you started doing have you always done a budget or what uh we've done them for about fifteen years about fifteen years oh so quite a while huh did you just sit down and decide yeah yeah this much is this much is gonna go here and the thing we have a hard time with was you know like how much for the groceries and how much for the clothes and how much for well one thing we do about the groceries and when and we just got back from the grocery store and we've been doing this for a long time and we know exactly how much we spend at the grocery store because when we come home we write it down um-hum oh oh so in a given month we know that we spent two hundred and fifty dollars or four hundred dollars or whatever it is and if it's four hundred dollars we look at it and say well why did we spend four hundred dollars uh-huh oh and we spent four hundred dollars this month because or last month because uh we had several Christmas parties December right right so but we know approximately how much our our monthly grocery bill is you know and and you should be able to do that too within um-hum ten or fifteen percent of what uh what you spend once you get a track record right if we just huh so and once you establish your track record so what  okay so what kind of books do you like to read um i think Sidney Sheldon is probably my favorite author uh-huh i'm a teacher and so when i read for pleasure i read strictly for escape uh-huh so i like you know i like books that are pretty high adventure and just real simple easy reading what about you uh-huh um i prefer my favorite types of books are um human interest type books biographies um it can be fiction about people i like books that are about people that have historical you know that tell you something about the history at the same time you know or a certain area so oh that's good that's good what book have you read that you really like um do you like about recent people or people in history both either one yeah um i've read lots of books i really like let me think um have you ever heard of a book called The Hiding Place both oh yes that's wonderful that's one of my favorite books that's really neat yeah i like books like that too by Corrie Ten Boom yeah yeah uh-huh yeah that's a wonderful book that's funny you should mention that one yeah yeah i like um i guess my preference is for Christian biographies but i i'm interested in both you know because i you learn a lot from reading about people's lives and oh okay um so yeah that's probably one of my all time favorites what what would you say is your favorite book that you've ever read oh i don't know with all the hip and hype i still love Gone with the Wind i haven't gotten a copy of Scarlett yet but uh uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure i won't love it as much as Gone with the Wind but that's that's just a real masterpiece um yeah i guess that really is my favorite book yeah are you uh-huh uh-huh i remember a long time ago i read some books by Glen Bristol you ever read any no i never have yeah those um i don't know why Gone with the Wind made me think of that but those are books that are um like they some of them took place in well there's one that took place in Georgia and another that took place California yeah they're historically based fiction so they're are they historically based uh-huh i like historically based fiction yeah yeah when um oh all those books by John Jakes came out uh-huh i i don't think i am i don't think i am but go ahead yeah are you familiar with what i'm talking about there were like huh oh it started with The Bastard and then it when it came over to the United States and took us through the Revolutionary War and the Civil War i've forgotten what all of them were oh yes uh-huh uh-huh they were right around the Centennial year though um uh-huh and they were really you know i really i i got into them and read i guess probably four or five of them and then i got burned out and said oh i think i'm tired of this group i like ones that are families yeah uh-huh like you read one and then you read about the next generation and the following generation oh yeah yeah i'm i think they also asked do you ever read books for self improvement yeah that's right i do sometimes but um they have to have illustrations or else i i get bored with them what do you mean by illustrations for for the most part i mean illustrations real examples you know instead of just giving me a sermon or giving me a you know how to type idea right right do you know what i hate i hate to read books by people like How to Raise Children and they're single yeah yeah see they have to have some real you know dealing with your teenager and they're never around kids you know right yeah some real examples from their own life that proves that they know what they're talking about i just read one called uh The Language of Love hm by Gary Smalley and someone else and that was really good yeah it's full of personal illustrations and illustrations of people they'd work with their um psychologists was it good hm so what about you what do you like to read for self-improvement i don't know i i really i get i i like i would rather read a book that's like for inspiration than a real self help book i mean uh-huh yeah yeah i don't know i don't get off on them just a whole lot i get bored real fast yeah i guess i agree there uh-huh yeah when i when my kids were younger i used to read books on how to raise kids and had nothing they said worked so i i said enough of that uh-huh oh dear yeah uh-huh yeah so uh-huh but i do like you know i like various and sundry kinds of books i like to read ones like by Bill Cosby fun Erma Bombeck things of that type too uh-huh oh yeah with humor in them those are yeah i love humor yeah yeah those are good yeah well i think that probably covers the topic oh yeah i think it probably does well okay i've enjoyed talking to you yeah i have too though good-bye have a good evening thank you bye-bye okay uh you too bye-bye  do you wanna tell me about your budgeting plan yeah our budgeting plans includes me getting a job we're we're at the point now i i uh i quit working about six months ago to start this house uh-huh and i'm out of cash and i'm not out of project yet oh no so uh i'm gonna go back and do some consulting work as far as budget's concerned i'm i'm fairly fortunate uh we've we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra we can make it on what my wife makes so uh the project's kind of halted until then as far as budgeting is concerned you know we have uh some pretty strict guidelines that we go for you know we always put ten percent back and that's a never touch uh into savings yeah huh either savings or investment one of the two but we don't ever put it at a high risk it's just always gonna be there well that's pretty good and as far as the rest of it's concerned we don't have any kind of uh what i would call extravagant expenses you know uh we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month you know just travel to and from work and clothing and food boy that's pretty good and the rest of it you know we pile into the house and uh you know i'm fairly fortunate i mean our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm sure a little a little behind on that but uh we're still making the payments on them it's just uh when you see in Texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home and do it yourself yeah it's it's tough here too you have to have the contractor sign with you right exactly but it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it here in Utah where i live that is yeah and where i live it it's pretty scary because Texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that and you screw up you don't get it finished the bank can eat the contractor uh-huh oh bad for him huh yeah bad for him but the homeowner can't be touched it's a homestead state hum is that right yeah see right now if i quit paying any of my bills the only thing they could do is cut off the electricity they can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes period wow you know they take your car and your clothes and your anything that's not the tools of your trade but as far as uh you know you're pretty much bullet proof in this state well that's kind of handy yeah i just finished James Michener's Texas book pretty interesting uh-huh Texas has quite the history well you know we're we're not ones to budget much you know we just got to spend it all that's kind of what we do we uh we're LDS and so we pay ten percent tithing um-hum um-hum and then i know we put i guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account um-hum but that sometimes we use for emergency type things yeah but uh and my wife doesn't work we're fortunate that way that i make enough to do what we wanna do yeah yeah we're pretty pretty fortunate as far as the uh the budgeting is concerned because you know we don't have any long term debt you know uh we paid cash for car well we bought the car on time one of them but we you know we since paid it off and well that's pretty the land is paid for cash so we don't have to worry about that that's a great position to be in well it's fraught with other problems is that right yeah i'm not very motivated oh what kind of consulting do you do uh systems consulting computerization for construction firms is that right i'm into computers too i i'm a E D P auditor yeah are you oh and you into mainframes yeah and PCs and oh really yeah i'm just brushing up on well C plus plus are you really uh-huh and i just got that a few days ago trio oh jeez don't get me to lying i bought it at a fire stale ah this guy's place burned down and he had a bunch of computer stuff and you know i bought it all it was two hundred bucks for everything he had you got a buy well some of it wasn't worth anything you know you know a lot of the uh diskettes were just totally unusable sure melted well yeah or wet or just wet or okay but i did get out of there with uh Vermont Views which is a huge subroutine library  what kind of movies have you been seeing lately uh it's been probably a month or so since i've been to the movies uh course my my favorite now is is Dances With Wolves oh it's an excellent movie uh Silence of the Lan uh of the Lambs was good Silence of the Lambs uh-huh what was that anyway because i didn't get a chance to see it oh it's a i guess it's a mystery you'd call it it's with uh Jodie Foster okay and it uh it's pretty good another one that i think i really liked was uh The Fisher King um-hum let's see who was in Fisher King that was um Robin Williams and uh right and um i can't say the other fellow's name how about you what are you uh we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately um we really enjoyed um Dead Poet's Society yes um several years back when we saw uh we saw the we really really enjoyed was uh Ordinary People with um Timothy Hutton and uh Mary Tyler Moore and uh uh who played the father anyway excellent movie right that was that was an excellent movie have you seen Dances With Wolves yes we have that what'd you think of it oh we loved it i don't think i can see it enough times i know what you mean i know what you mean course i'm a Kevin Costner fan yeah um pretty impressed with stuff he's done uh he made kind of an odd sounding Robin Hood but uh i mean you know basic thick western US accent for a Robin Hood just doesn't seem to fit but no but you know it wasn't bad movie it got such bad reviews really and and i thoroughly enjoyed it but i then i wasn't expecting any classic either oh no it was a good movie well um they did a real good job with it i thought so um they didn't try to make him super human or you know invincible they just he worked hard at it have you seen The Fisher King no i haven't not had the opportunity to see that uh uh it you you know i guess it it really isn't for everybody it's it's pretty deep and and uh uh philosophical yeah but i thought it had a wonderful message to it it's kind you came out and looked at somebody says you know i think i liked that and then the more you got to thinking about it the more you thought you know i did like it yeah yeah but when you first came out you weren't real sure it sounds kind of like one uh we saw at home here on the we rented it um Clara's Heart haven't seen that um it's Whoopi Goldberg oh yes i did yes i did yeah she played a uh they um uh nanny the nanny type she was a housekeeper yeah she's a housekeeper she housekeeper uh-huh she was um oh no i can't say it not Haitian anyway she uh she seemed to be that sort of person that you know about seems half crazy but then again she's got a whole lot on the ball and the movie had the whole uh a lot of philosophical content more than more than you know it it wasn't a mystery it wasn't a you know blood and guts and violence and and and car chases type thing it was just a good movie i saw one the other day that was A Kiss Before Dying a Kiss Before Dying um-hum i had not heard about it when it was on the movies but was out on video yeah and it's with Sean Young yeah and it's a it's a mystery it was very predictable i mean you knew you knew when the murder was gonna happen or something but it was still so well done yeah that it was enjoyable that's that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable but still worth watching that's right i had uh oh uh i like the i think it's called the uh Razor's Edge the no no the Jagged Edge the Jagged Edge not familiar with that one oh okay with uh  now are we off and running that you were saying sorry oh i was just saying i guess old age has a few compensations i don't have to plan as carefully as i used to but uh do you feel like you you took the steps that you you were glad that you took um earlier i mean would you have done anything differently no i don't think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um that's that's quite a feat in today's economic situation yeah that's wonderful um i'm sort of beginning in that score um we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so uh-huh it's it's not easy putting enough aside but we're doing a um our best to try and have fairly regular meetings to discuss at least where our goals are sometimes um it is less consistent than than it could be in terms of our ability to put money aside but um i'm i'm curious about the things that you did that that seemed to work best for you that you'd pass on to somebody else uh well as as advice the only way if if you spend all you take in every month you're uh living beyond your means that's right and emergencies or what we could would consider an emergency uh always come up yeah i i i don't care how how you how closely you think you figured and then planned something always comes up so uh when i i guess we started by necessity because we went to uh law school on my husband's GI Bill uh-huh back in the days when uh the government paid uh the student's tuition and and bought books up to a certain amount plus uh gave the veteran a stipend we started off with ninety dollars a month and then a little bit later got up to a hundred and five dollars a month uh-huh so there was no way that we could do except when we cashed our monthly stipend was to put twenty dollars a week in an envelope right deciding that it was better to go without one day a week than for four days at the end of the month um-hum um-hum and then uh later on when we got out of school my husband got recalled into the Air Force when the Korean mess came up and uh so we had already established the envelope habit and uh and the envelope is your savings no no no this was our weekly budget oh okay but uh we realized very early on that if we were going to have money to buy cars and that sort of thing that we would have to save up beforehand uh-huh uh-huh so uh we uh uh began uh in nineteen fifty uh to pay cash for everything we bought a car in nineteen fifty and paid it off in three months so since then except for a house houses we've paid cash for everything and uh to illustrate how well that works so that you have the opportunity to take care of special pricing uh-huh uh our headquarters was transferred from South Carolina to Texas one time and because Texas gas was much much cheaper to cook with than electricity this one couple that we were transferred with uh bought a gas stove a very simplified gas stove for a hundred and forty some odd dollars uh-huh we had uh in storage and used uh just a little teeny gas stove but after we got to Waco we saw an ad in the paper one day where a lady who had uh was moving into a house with a built in oven had the very best stove that Sears made at the time with two ovens a grill in the middle on top clock all the fancy amenities uh-huh uh-huh and we were able to buy it for a hundred dollars because we had the cash yes yeah and uh uh that's that's been the case for us with with uh cars and our preference recently has been used cars so it's been nice to be able to negotiate when you have cash when you're buying a car the yeah uh-huh yeah well that's a that's a an important lesson do you feel like you've passed that along to your three kids given how different the economy's been in their lives no unfortunately we have not except for one daughter-in-law and uh rise up and call her blessed every day uh for some reason or other my husband didn't see fit to give the boys a meaningful allowance he just felt he had to keep control control of the purse strings uh-huh and uh when they went off to college they had never really budgeted uh-huh and uh that that was a big mistake so even though you know your children are going to make mistakes uh i don't i don't know how to tell you  hobbies do you have oh i love quilting crocheting painting uh just a number of things what do you have well you've got you you're good at all the things that i'm very poor at what are your hobbies oh i um i jog and i play the saxophone and the piano oh i play in a little jazz band a local community band over here what part of Dallas are you in um North Dallas uh what's the name of the town i live in Garland uh right on the border of Richardson oh he he lives my son lives in Dallas in Plano oh quite close uh-huh well uh do you have much opportunity to play the saxophone quite yeah because i'm in this jazz band i you know we we meet once a week and then we'll have a concert um several times a year we'll go play wherever anybody needs a band oh how fun yeah we play a lot of um jazz from the from the forties and fifties and it's it's a lot of fun i'm i'm i'm the only girl in the band oh oh that would be fun and uh well the average the median age has to be about sixty so oh my goodness so it's a bunch of you know old folks getting together and playing um-hum well you don't sound like you're in that category no i'm not i'm i'm twenty seven but um i enjoy it a whole lot because they talk about you know a lot of um older musicians oh um-hum well i have we i belong to a quilting group uh-huh and do you all meet like once a week once a month and there's about eleven of us and so we meet every uh once a month and then we each get a turn to have a quilt uh-huh oh so you each get a quilt out of it and then everybody helps on it uh-huh well that's nice yeah we get help with the quilt so we enjoy that and then i do a lot of quilting on the side on the ones that you um do for your like if you get the quilt do you get to pick what pattern you want or yes we furnish the material and the quilt and everything and then people just come that and then we spend all day quilting and have dinner and uh just just get together and visit and quilt well that sounds nice it is nice we really enjoy that and then in the evenings i i do a lot of crocheting crocheting and what kind of things do you crochet uh-huh oh afghans uh pillows uh i'm i i'm just doing right now some uh Christmas ornaments uh-huh Christmas ornaments well that sounds nice um-hum yeah snowflakes and things like that bells balls it's always nice to get a few unique ornaments you know that mean something to you yes like a we have uh six children and i gave each of them some for their trees this year you have quite a large family um-hum um-hum plenty of quilting to keep you busy yes and we have fourteen grandchildren so i'm trying to get a quilt for each one of them oh fifteen after today oh my yeah that'll keep you busy right there fifteen after today yeah that's true well congratulations that's just wonderful what's what's the little child's name we don't know yet oh they haven't quite decided well no it came early and she had to have an emergency C section so we didn't get we they don't have the name yet oh well i'm glad everything's all right yeah but uh do you have any other uh hobbies well i didn't i we jog quite a bit um this you and your husband my husband and i yes and um we take one of our dogs she jogs with us and just recently i did my first fifteen K which is a little over nine miles uh-huh so hopefully this year i'll be able to do a half of a marathon which is thirteen miles so oh yeah that's kind of what i'd like to work up to i've been ill a little bit over the holidays so i haven't um had time to um you know do any type of running really uh-huh we have two sons that run one's a pilot for American and the other one's a doctor in Cleveland and so they uh they do those marathons too uh-huh uh-huh well but my husband walks a lot but he doesn't jog what kind of painting do you do tole painting and uh painting on wood wood things uh-huh mostly i don't do any oil or anything like that my mother just started painting and so with what uh she started water color and she took a class at the local community college and i wanted her to take another class she wants to um i think get into some drawing by hand because that's what she feel best with uh-huh uh-huh but other than that i don't have a whole lot of hobbies i've got three pets and they pretty much two dogs and a cat and they keep me kind of busy and um well those are hobbies aren't they yeah i suppose so what kind of dogs are they well one of them is part Great Dane in fact we think she's mostly Great Dane but um we found her and then the second dog she looks Black Lab we found her too oh oh so uh we got a bunch of strays running around the house my husband has a little cocker spaniel that walks with him oh when he when he's here when he doesn't you know he walks at the University of Utah a lot too but he's he uh walks here and takes the dog with her with him is he a professor out there no no he's an educational specialist what kind of what uh what does that mean well he is a civilian employee of the Army and he just uh tests uh universities and the high schools to place students where they'd like to be if they join the Army oh i see um-hum well even if they don't they can still take the test have all your kids left home yes well yes we have one that's uh on a mission in Germany for our church uh-huh well how neat  which baseball team's your favorite uh i don't really have a favorite baseball team but of course the Rangers play here oh uh-huh and and they've made a whole team history of trading away players that become all stars later on so oh have they like who are some of their who are some of their players that they've traded away uh several pitchers that Toby Harra and uh oh Doc Meddich a another pitcher and of course now they've they've sunk all their money into Nolan Ryan so uh-huh oh oh but they they they have they have Ruben Sierra and they have um uh Julio Franco oh so they've had some real good ones over the years yeah and they they traded away um Incaviglia to Detroit i think and then he hit more home runs this year than he'd ever hit before um-hum oh ah well that's good do they is is baseball for young kids there a big thing do they start them out early or where do they get all these good players from uh no well they get them from you know Puerto Rico and Mexico and the minor leagues oh oh the baseball baseball has a big minor league system especially in a a few players come out of college and then uh more players um go straight to the minors um-hum oh and that gives them time to see uh pitching at a higher speed you know and um-hum how do so do they have a a program at all for young kids there for baseball or is soccer the biggest thing or yeah they do it's it's mostly in the schools the i think the biggest thing here is soccer that's that's what i thought that soccer is bigger it used to be around here anyway that um baseball was real big for the young boys but now it it soccer is um-hum making a real quick catch up um i know they have the four and five year old kids start like with the tee ball um-hum are you familiar with that at all right yeah the tee ball and i think they go until they're seven then they have the pitching machine i think eight and nine and then and then just the regular pitching after that but um-hum it's not it's not a big as program as it as it used to be and i'm i'm not really familiar around here we don't have any baseball teams i don't think that even in Salt Lake City there is a no there's not California's the nearest place there's a right right so it it's not there's no teams around here that i really follow and am close with have you ever played baseball yeah uh no just in P E uh it's it's pretty big here in high school and they've they've had several players um picked in the draft you know they they're picked in lower rounds is it oh uh-huh especially pitchers oh uh but mostly they just go on to college because because because they need the experience and the education so right uh-huh right well that's i remember uh playing baseball when i was just in grade school but by the time you know we got to P E it it wasn't a real um-hum a real big thing either but i enjoy baseball just for a fun pastime now with you know a group gets together a family reunion or whatever or or it we we live in a real small community and they have uh like Fourth of July celebrations and people'll get together and play softball and that's fun i really enjoy that i think it's a fun game i think it's funner to play than to watch myself right yeah so do you do you enjoy playing it at all or do you enjoy watching it even yeah i i um i enjoy playing and it took always took me we'd play you know during the spring semester always took me about six weeks before i could see the ball before i could hit the ball uh-huh oh oh uh-huh and uh yeah it's do you and but i enjoy playing i enjoy uh watching the All-Star Game and the World Series was really good this year right oh the there were some spectacular catches and a lot of home runs and they had uh several double plays you know and oh uh-huh was it in Candlestick Park again uh no it was uh uh Minnesota Twins versus the Atlanta Braves oh and both the teams were in last place at one point in the season this year um-hum my word then they fought their way back up to the top and then of course Minnesota won i think in the seventh game and ended up oh wow oh that would be exciting i i was so it was really exciting listened a little bit about it but i didn't know you know much about it oh so it had to go the full seven games right oh and it looked for a while that like Atlanta was gonna the win you know before they went back to Minnesota but it didn't happen you know they played oh  Jerry tell me about what you think about the Vietnam war okay well i'm a Vietnam era veteran and uh i was uh uh fortunate not to have to serve in the theater however uh my my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation uh i'm of the old school that believes that um the uh uh contracts that we made back years ago uh needed to be honored however uh i think we could've executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker oh but those are my personal thoughts and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run World War Two we'd have got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people but as it was the politicians ran the the Korean conflict and ultimately the Vietnam thing and we managed to come out uh losers all way around and so this is what triggered ultimately triggered the us uh uh the United States per se being uh deciding to get out of the role of world policeman your views uh-huh as i understand it and i uh don't don't a lot about it uh we got in there because of France uh France was there first they had well we got into it because of a SEATO agreement back just right after World War Two that uh we pledged a mutual um uh defense of of the South Vietnamese and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really we i i question us you know now of course uh hindsight is all too clear um sure so we're we we have to have to deal with with the uh situation as as we played it but Jerry what did you think of people like uh Jane Fonda another war anti antiwar activist i don't get me started on those people you know before she before Jane Fonda did did what she did i thought she was a wonderful person but after uh uh well i i just don't have anything want anything to do with her anymore because you support uh you support your government right or wrong uh okay right or wrong i don't think is is we can determine whether we were right or wrong because you're you're having to deal with again again uh i think we could've made a different agreement back in forties the forties the late forties era that would've kept out of there uh-huh uh you know i i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that i thought we came in as as first advisors to the the French and then they decided to pull out and so can you hold just second second Terry one moment please sure sure wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something huh that's neat well that's not that's okay sorry for the delay uh yeah this is the uh the the uh the mutual defense thing was we we yeah it was complicated and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation i don't but from what i can gather is we went and said yeah we will help the uh South Vietnamese uh should they ask well the French went in and tried their old style warfare and uh got soundly thrashed and we didn't do a whole lot better um no i had thought that they had uh colonies there or something well yeah that was the old French colony but see the French the French were our uh allies in NATO and they're also our allies in SEATO right which was the South East Asia Treaty Organization which has since been abandoned disbanded as far as i know you know NATO is is on the way of being disbanded uh but uh the yeah the French yeah we went in as an ally to the French and says yeah we'll we'll help you out if you get in a bind well they got in a bind and says we don't wanna you know play anymore uh-huh so uh we we kind of we kind of got started got the ball rolling ourselves versus a bunch of top secret silly organizations uh um i see oh operations operations and then a full scale you know full scale troops et cetera et cetera et cetera yeah i'm thirty two so uh i barely well i missed it seventy four is when we quit sending troops over ah yeah roughly yeah i i was just probably three three or four years old  okay what kind of foods would you have okay um well i like to cook um but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it just because um oh i do too hum-um uh it's too much pressure you know if i have people over for dinner i like it to be nice but relaxed yeah uh-huh well yeah you can't enjoy it right and so i don't like to arrive or or when they arrive for me to be completely worn out so that's that's what i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking in the oven it's everybody just yeah exactly says how wonderful it is and it's it's like uh yes uh i that's one of those things that i got famous for in college people would come and say could you would you come over and make lasagna for me it's like well i can't really give you a recipe um i can uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh-huh you just do it i can just do it so it's i like doing that kind of stuff and it's it's fun because in fact that's what we had for a Christmas party last week uh-huh yeah uh-huh we just had a bunch of people over and we had we did lasagna and garlic bread and ah yummy um boy i like that uh i do too in fact yeah well i'm planning a and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for um people tomorrow night and the next night hm on Tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether so oh oh good uh i'd say one thing we've done have done quite a bit through the holidays just because it's a real easy is just baked potato dinners oh yeah uh-huh and have you like three or four couples come over and i'll do the potatoes and you know like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings whatever they like uh-huh and it turns out great because i mean you've got like hot sauce and taco meat and barbecue and you know bacon and all that good stuff yeah that's fun uh-huh but it's it's inexpensive plus it's real easy on the hostess because you can just have the potatoes ready and just have a salad with it and you got a great dinner yeah yeah that's a good idea it's it's real easy i like doing that part ah i'm in favor of very little clean up um very little planning because we've got three or four couples that we get together with to play games and yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh it's we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids and that it's it's fine because then i can just say okay fine you bring this you bring this you bring this we're done oh it's pretty cool uh-huh yeah yeah that's good well one of my favorites if i don't wanna have other people bring stuff i just wanna treat them is to make chicken and rice it's it's very easy to uh-huh oh oh you don't like it oh you do okay yeah i have a really easy recipe for that where you just brown the chicken and then you oh i love it hm put rice in the bottom of the pan you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it and or you put the chicken in then pour the uh broth over and you can put mushrooms in if you want and then just oh over the uncooked rice yeah over uncooked rice and you can either microwave it or do it in the oven and it just it fluffs up and it's really moist and oh oh how neat huh now i've done it with where you put you cook the rice well i guess you probably could do it some way but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup and put a bit of white wine in it um-hum uh-huh ooh yeah and every once in a while i'll put in white i'll slice white grapes and i'll put it in there and that's because i'm not a real big wine person but i like it it it adds something to the chicken and then just bake it and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice uh-huh yeah hm well i'll keep that one in mind too yeah yeah it's it that was one of the first things i made for my husband because it's like hm yeah i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be kind of sort of elegant kind of yeah uh-huh yeah you can get away with it and you know in having a semi nice dinner or you know semi formal but oh yeah but then i didn't i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice so just like in a thirteen by nine pan yeah yeah you put in um let's see what was it three quarters of cup of rice or hm hm it depends on you can really vary it but you have to put the water in proportionally i can't remember i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water two cups um broth uh-huh huh yeah yeah it's i i use that for breakfast for rice and for when i cook pasta or something i'll i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to give it a little extra flavor and yeah that's flavor um-hum hm now that would be good how long do you have to bake it yeah uh-huh um let's see i think it was an hour i've done it in the microwave so often lately because it's it's really easy yeah i do i do microwave too a lot it's but i think it's about an hour or maybe it's only half hour hm um how long would it be in the microwave how long would it be in the microwave you just until the rice looks fluffy and and not overdone you know before it gets overdone oh okay okay do you just brown the chicken to get it colored or do you go ahead and let it cook through yeah yeah um i'd let it cook just a little bit just so that the cooking goes a little faster but okay hm oh this is a beneficial call i like this yeah but that one's an easy one it's like just put in a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up the with the soup and the wine put in garlic and onion powder yeah well i liked it your idea too there uh-huh yeah or chopped onions if you wanna do that you know whatever whatever you however much effort you feel like putting into it but it it makes a great i mean my i've got a two year old and a four year old and they love it uh-huh uh-huh and because because my daughter calls it her gravy and i mean she thinks it's wonderful i'm like good you're a picky eater if i can get you to eat  yes uh crime is our subject um-hum have you ever been accused of a crime have i um no i guess not i haven't either really i guess other than you want to count car accidents or something like that yeah uh they asked for solutions uh yeah that's it i'll i'll be i'll be very out forespoken here uh the Arabs don't do everything in the world right but gosh they sure don't have too many repeat offenders over there that's true that's true they uh in in fact uh also i don't know if you're familiar with the Japanese method of of dealing with crimes uh no i no i'm not but they don't they have an extremely low rate extremely low especially considering the uh the density of the population and stuff um they have uh they have this this sense of of family that's very important to them and and family honor and what they do the the main punishment the most effective portion of their punishment is that they take and publish the offender's name in a newspaper that gets spread all over the country and especially in the region that they're in and the family's name too it well it gives the the person's name and the family is typically so embarrassed that they have to they sell their house they leave they leave the region and move to to the opposite end of Japan of Japan and so it shames the entire family including the grandparents and and maybe aunts and uncles yeah that's similar to what was this town maybe it was here in some place that on prostitution uh-huh when they caught a uh a a a customer trying to solicit a prostitute either way however you wanna say it they would publish the names of the customer and address of the customer in the newspaper right there are a lot of divorces lot of family counseling going on but prostitution went down in that city i i'm willing to bet yeah yeah it just about killed the business well publicity huh it doesn't work over in this country does it uh-huh yeah well well you know the thing i guess the thing is is you know with the uh the in part uh one of the things to blame is the disintegration of the family in general and and the importance of the family and and and that's yeah yeah but you know you can't just magically push a button and make that come back i guess but uh uh if you yeah if you can wanna compare crime rates by divorce and and single parents and everything else i'm sure they'll be at a direct proportion to it probably uh related uh unfortunately uh but incidentally incidentally um i just uh just just reading in the newspaper about um uh this they're i don't know they were moving some of the uh highway uh things in here in Texas recenttly the offices um and they had ranked Dallas as being uh seven out of seven on scale of of quality of life and i assume that that that includes that includes crime nowhere nowheres else nowhere else in the state was above about a three point two yeah and and and and Dallas was a seven point O seven for Dallas if if you live but we cut them off at five hundred a a year and January first we had three in one day yeah i swear uh i i really yeah i really i thought it was pretty surprising i think Austin should be seven of seven that is i went to school and graduated from UT and oh it's hey if i if i hadn't stayed in Austin i should've gone to Stephenville Texas i'll tell you yeah yeah well they they uh even even Austin's had it's share of of nasty crimes recently right with the with the sort of senseless murder of these girls at the um um at uh the ice cream parlor guy just walked in and uh um-hum pull the trigger yeah i guess so well obviously in Texas we let them out too soon but you know look at the what's the cost of keeping them in it's something like uh uh yeah it's like twenty thousand dollars per per year to keep somebody in jail astronomical did you see where the private ventures that built the jails and they're gonna help alleviate the overcrowding conditions are don't have any customers hum nobody wants the city or the the government doesn't wanna let them do it who i i guess huh it looks to me like you know whether you you you get government out of it and give it to private enterprise it's done cheaper and more economical and more efficiently put the profit motive in front of anybody and all of a sudden it it works yeah all of a sudden it works huh isn't that awful no it's not that's what makes just customer go around you know i was telling a guy from IRS and and i said something about profit he said thank goodness for profit i said i beg your pardon he said yeah Internal Revenue Service we tax profits i wouldn't have a job if there wasn't any profits yeah huh yeah yeah that's true you rather have people to cry to yeah but i don't know you know i mean obviously you know obviously some more jails isn't really the solution either i don't know i mean that doesn't seem to be um well maybe we ought to um terribly effective put them in these Air Force bases that are closing and utilize those you know yeah well there's there've been several you know those those kind of died on the vine they were there were separate proposals around to do that kind of thing and i haven't heard anything about them recently and maybe maybe i'm the one that just hasn't been paying attention um i read an interesting article in Texas Monthly a few months back about this guy that was a uh a guard at the Ellis Unit down in Huntsville uh-huh and he was a regular guard a a what they call a new boot or something like that and one thing led to another somebody asked for light of a cigarette or a cigarette and before long he was running dope for them and he got caught and now he's in prison himself uh-huh and the the article purpose of the article was just to emphasize that nobody's above it um yeah yeah i know  so what kind of dining out do you enjoy well we usually do things that have to do with families because i have a family of four so uh-huh four children or four children yeah six of us altogether so uh-huh yeah when we go out it's usually someplace that caters to children more so than adult uh-huh so that has a children's menu or uh-huh yeah how about you um well i don't have any children um and i'm a newlywed so right now i guess my favorite type of restaurant is is a place that's fairly quiet and has a pleasant atmosphere i sort of like the either an old country look or something um dim lights or something just you know the have you found one in Dallas that you like um well i enjoy Steak and Ale yeah that's that seems to have a pretty nice atmosphere usually not i don't like noise i just hate it when restaurants are like Bennigan's and yeah yeah they just opened up an Olive Garden here in Plano that's the other one that i really like yeah i haven't the in Plano i haven't um oh yeah do you like it there i'm sure they're probably the same all over i've heard that their bread sticks are terrific yeah yeah i've been to one here in Dallas yeah they are they really are i've only been there once uh but almost a year ago and i wanna go back i'd thought about it ever since it's not on our side of town huh yeah we've been meaning to try this one out here yeah do you guys like what kind of food do you like um well my husband loves anything beef so he likes steak or ribs or something but i kind of like more variety i like to be able to yeah me too when i go out i like to have things that i don't cook at home you know when just he and i go out then it yeah exactly uh-huh it's almost always fish or something that i don't wanna do at home yeah yeah i like to have a choice of fish or chicken and Italian food Mexican food uh-huh you know something um yeah something that i wouldn't that takes more time to cook at home yeah what um what makes you go back there um i'd say well one thing is the price i don't like it yeah i was gonna say price is probably my biggest concern yeah yeah if it's overpriced or you know i mean if it's i like to still be able to get a meal for well i'd prefer five dollars or less they that's unusual these days if you go out yeah it seems like you can get the same menu for lunch cheap have you ever tried that just going for lunch and then uh-huh yeah yeah we like uh Tony Roma's it's a rib place oh yeah i've heard of that where is it uh-huh well um let's see there's there's one up at um see what is it just as um loop twelve turns into thirty five it merges it's right there it's sort of a restaurant row in Dallas there uh-huh yeah and then there's also one down at the Marketplace West End Marketplace and we found out one day by mistake that lunch is about half as much as dinner is and you get about almost the same amount yeah in almost any restaurant that's almost the case that we've seen yeah um-hum so i'd say that's the first thing i look for is price and then atmosphere yeah yeah how about you probably price would be first um we're not you know we seems like we're always rushing rushing around doing something so location that would have a lot to do with it too i mean we don't really travel to Mesquite or you know somewhere that takes half an hour to get there so yeah uh-huh uh-huh we've you know tried most of the places around here and that's kind of where we stay yeah so so what would your favorite place be or one of your favorites oh gee or some of your favorites have you tried um The Louisiana Purchase do they have any of those over there no i've never heard of that those are good and it's kind of Cajun i usually don't like spicy food but that's real good especially lunch you know because for the same reason because it's got some atmosphere and yet the price is is good um-hum uh-huh my husband really likes Chinese food so we go Chinese just a little mom and pop kind of places uh-huh more so than the bigger yeah i like Chinese too yeah and sometimes you can uh you can often get that at a good price yeah and some of them have good atmosphere too so yeah hum Chinese places doesn't seem like they really cater to atmosphere the ones around here anyways just uh-huh yeah some of them don't just authentic that's all it you know it says authentic on the outside yeah yeah so do you like places that are noisy that are lively yeah no not necessarily um when i go out with my husband i just want to be able to to talk to him so that doesn't lend itself to that and when i'm with my children the more noise there is the more nose noise they think they can make so it doesn't it tends to make them wilder so uh-huh right yeah i'm sure it does i really like the Black-Eyed Pea but i also think that's real noisy have you ever been to a Black-Eyed Pea um-hum yeah i have it's got such a open atmosphere and clanking and banging that i love the food but it is really noisy yeah yeah that's what i found too so well do you have anything else you wanted to say no i think that's pretty much what makes me go back  and women's place in the workplace huh uh to quote my father a woman's place is in the stove i have to disagree my wife works say what what do you do oh i disagree i disagree yeah so do i so do i um i'm a lab tech are you yep well i guess as far as roles in the workplace they've uh they've made some you know pretty serious uh ground in the last thirty forty years that right they've generally increased considerably uh my sister is a she's a medical professional oh really and you know she says that in in in order to get paid the same as a man you have to do twice the work yeah see i can but fortunately it's not that tough well yeah that i can see that i can see that i i i do think that uh um higher positions like administrative more often go to the man than they do the woman yeah yeah i i'll grant you that but hopefully that'll change soon well it hasn't been true of any of my companies oh really yeah because the only women that i hire are ones that are capable right if they're capable they can do anything they wanna do right well i work for a private laboratory and and when it's a small company you see where you're you're kind of overstepped because you are a woman and but i think uh it i think it's starting to change yeah yeah well i hope so i really do yes i do too considering i am a woman yeah well for your sake sure but uh i think that as long as yeah the uh American society is inundated as it is by the commercial market you know the right television's commercials in particular uh progress is gonna be rather rapid but shaping role models is gonna be a problem right um-hum because you know they don't wanna rock the boat with anybody right right and you know i don't know how you perceive life but i know that people are prejudiced and they bigoted and they carry their their convictions all the way to the bone no matter what they say right right right and uh you know i'm the first one well i flunked the the MCP test big time oh really you know what that is no huh-uh oh a man and his son were driving along the road in a convertible and they have a car wreck and the the father's killed and the boy is rushed to the emergency room and the doctor walks in looks down says i can't operate on him that's my son all right the that was his mother all right you passed oh believe me it's not that easy for a lot of men to understand that i yeah i can yeah i can see that i can see that yeah and i have a woman doctor yeah oh really isn't that strange i have a man doctor really well actually we go to Doctor Garcia's office we started going with him soon as he got done with his residency uh-huh he was a guy at the emergency room when we went there and then when he got his office well we just you know stayed with him and he's hired this other lady and uh my sister says that she's a better doctor yeah i don't know you know i see doctor once every six months you know but uh well that's what that i think that's one place that you know the roles of women are changing you don't see um uh you well you see a lot more women in medical profession higher up as in doctors and everything i know several that are are pathologists and forensic pathologists and yeah you know used to you didn't see that or hear of it at all yeah well getting into medical school is no no mean trick either right that's true that's true but uh as far as a you know the the the role of women in the workplace i think Texas has come remarkably far considering considering the the high density of rednecks that there are around oh yeah isn't that true isn't that true i'm a i'm a transplant i'm you know we came from out of state uh so did i when i was very young but it was too late i was already formed oh i came as an adult here yeah well you know i was like uh i guess ten or eleven yeah yeah and we came from uh a family that was my mother is strong to say the least did she work um no not outside the home hm no she was a she went to college and you know correspondence courses and whatnot but my parents were in my dad was in the Air Force uh-huh uh-huh and all the time that uh you know he was in the Air Force well she's never had to work right you know he always provided the the financial support but she has worked uh therapeutically you know she something to do um-hum right i mean raising children  say you did uh starters and Bendix springs such as that on an old one yeah and uh helped my wife replace some carburetors yeah some that she had to uh um label everything she had to label everything what was she driving yeah because it was a Cadillac uh-huh and they uh well they quit making those the Quadrajet carburetor and they quit making it yeah they rebuilt it and it never did never did run right again yeah Quadrajet not real easy to get rebuilt just right yeah um what were you replacing the starters and Bendix drives on um a Maverick and also um a Chrysler station wagon before that yeah did you replace just the uh the Bendix on the Chrysler station wagon or the whole starter uh the i'm replacing the two or three starters on the Chrysler yeah the starters are kind of fragile they yeah and the especially if you need a tune up um-hum they kept saying that the Chrysler that's what Chryslers did is they wore out starters you know yeah well if if if they start real easy you know you just hit the key and it starts up and when it's properly tuned up that starter will last for a long time yeah see they built that starter so it'd fit every V-8 and all the slant sixes that they built in like thirty five years right they all take the exact same starter they'll interchange completely i mean completely one starter will fit all of them so they've got a whole lot of torque but to do that they did uh they use an underdrive system where they geared it down so its motor spins really fast um-hum so it's got to spin for very long it's kind of tough on the bushings usually what goes is the bushings you take a little time replace the bushings you still got a perfectly good starter yeah right but uh most places don't put don't rebuild them with with good with good enough bushings so it's you know um-hum after you get rebuilt one you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly especially if you need a tune-up no anyway what are you driving now um my Chrysler van and it's it's pretty maintenance free you know and uh and beginning the year last year and drove a Chevrolet Cavalier station wagon and it didn't give me any trouble at all that's good yeah what is it a late model set Chrysler van it's a eighty seven yeah one of the little minivans um-hum yeah is it do you like the way it rides and such uh rides or runs rides rough it yeah well yeah it rides rides rough it runs good you know i kind of it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine yeah yeah you have to kind of wait for it especially when you get on the highway yeah right now without getting some of the sportier models uh the four cylinders aren't real peppy yeah but uh they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years too you driven American cars all uh see i've driven one import uh i drove a Volkswagen Beetle for a while about a month um in that month i think i put uh three oil coolers on it um every time i turned around i was having trouble with it everything else i ever owned was American built uh mostly older cars um i've been a mechanic well i worked starting working my father's service station when i was about uh twelve um-hum so i've been around cars a lot but uh driven a lot of old Pontiacs my first three cars were uh seventy model Pontiacs a GTO and a Bonneville and a station wagon and i had a couple of Chryslers had a Super B for a while with a four forty in it it a lot of fun but uh not not much gas mileage though i don't know gas mileage wasn't too bad i got about seventeen oh wow well till you got crazy with it you know you get the four barrel all worked up and suddenly it it it drops off fast but yeah long as you didn't spin the tires too much or or spend too much time with the secondaries kicked in it it didn't do too bad on gas didn't have to work very hard to move the car around now do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs oh yeah yeah definitely um-hum you know the my last GM car was a seventy Chevy station wagon uh it still had the points and condenser in it when i rebuilt the engine on that about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car yeah i uh pulled that old points distributor out and got a an HEI distributor electronic distributor and put into it  uh what uh guess i should have talked before uh what team do you wanna huh are you familiar with i guess or do you have a favorite team i guess um yeah my favorite team's probably the Reds yeah i'm from Cincinnati yeah is it are are you really great yeah but uh most national league teams i'm pretty familiar with yeah i uh i'm i'm familiar with the Reds myself we lived out there in Dayton for three years so we used to root from the line i don't know they got a pretty good team but i see i kind of think the Braves are the gonna ones be the ones to go places this year oh really yeah that's what i thought even last year i thought they'd be doing pretty good yeah they're pretty they're so young and everything i i was just starting to get Dave Justice is one of my favorite players so yeah he's pretty exciting to watch i'm hoping he can pull them through and maybe have a good series like they did against the Twins again yeah i think the Dodgers you got to look out for with all the the hitting they've gotten recently oh yeah and who else did they pick up they got Strawberry and who else did they they got Davis from the Reds Davis too yeah and uh they traded away for some pitcher too oh yeah yeah because they dealt Belcher and then they got someone else i forgot his name though huh yeah i've i've kind of i they always make me nervous because Lasorda's good coach and everything but uh they got the bucks to spend they can get all those guys yeah it seems like they always get the the high paid guys and they always seem to end up doing pretty good for a while yeah yeah i uh i'm kind of a Mets fan myself too i uh like to see them go i don't know why but because they're well they just signed uh what Bonilla from Pittsburgh yeah Bonilla i see that's being from Pennsylvania i thought you'd maybe be a Pittsburgh fan but yeah but no huh do you no i keep up on it yeah i tell you though he's getting what six million a year or something yeah you cannot it's kind of hard to turn that down that's for sure yeah you got to think Bonds is worth more than that too yeah definitely i wonder if he is he gonna stay with them or no he's looking to leave from what i hear oh if he leaves then they're they're done with they won't go anywhere this year i mean that's their two biggest guys that are walking so yeah they signed a couple of their pitchers who are gonna be free agents yeah they resigned them well that's good that'll help but yeah yeah they got Walken someone else they resigned i wouldn't be surprised to see them if they go after Bonds but they're not gonna give them more than six million a year they can't afford it well i don't think anybody can i don't know if anybody's worth that much for what they do but uh yeah i don't know i really i say i really hope the Braves can pull it through they're i think they caught everybody's imagination last year it was a it was great series but it'd been fun to see them win it yeah you got to like the underdog yeah that's true maybe they can pull it off again but i tell you i don't know it's so are you a big baseball fan or do do you yeah pretty much yeah up where we are we don't get much baseball news but uh i try to keep up on it oh do you just through the papers or whatnot yeah reading the little transactions column is about all we get oh huh well what do you think about the A's and Canseco and those guys have they got any chance or i don't know they really surprised me last year when they dropped off so quick yeah i'm wondering if they're maybe just getting a little bit too high paid and thinking they're so good and yeah too many attitudes out there pardon too many attitudes out there i think so i think it yeah that's true that's definitely true they got a lot of high paid players that could start somewhere else as backup yep that's true got to get Canseco's mind off Madonna and then he might be able to play a little bit yeah exactly yeah or Steve Pickett's yeah but they were in the World Series so many years straight then they were in like third or fourth or something yeah then they that's like they dropped off the map and they had all the same players but yeah the Reds did the same thing players then down into fifth yep oh yeah that surprised me because they were so tough and then i just i just wonder like i say if they lose the desire they did it once and then they just forget it and yeah i don't know but uh you figured after all the Rose stuff was over everything would be fine and it was but then i don't know what happened last year um-hum yeah they just like i say they tailed right off but yeah i heard Davis was hurt quite a bit so that kind of hurt them yeah but he always is i mean that's why they got rid of him he only plays like half a season yeah that's true yeah it'll be interesting to see what he does now that he's out there with his bud Strawberry and if all of a sudden he becomes healthy all the time yeah he kept on saying that uh the Reds should switch to natural grass just for his knees but uh they never did but they got that out in LA that should help him uh-huh yeah it'll help but yeah we used to i was back there with the Reds when Ray Knight used to play and when he yeah when he took well it was the year that he took Pete Rose's place and of course he couldn't do anything right and yeah third base but uh we used to go i used to get free tickets for from school and go out and watch them but uh so they were always kind of were kind of a good my dad still loves them that's his favorite team but yeah yeah i can remember going to games there when i was a kid yeah that was good fun if i the stadium's what was amazing to me i mean we've got nothing that big out here as far as a you know baseball or football stadium you know walk inside and it was just huge to to see them but uh it would seem like it was always bigger on the inside than it was outside yeah because it looks small on the outside yeah i had all these huge i we always were up in the nose bleed seats so we never got a chance to get too close but yeah and anytime you try to walk down the uh the ushers would always tell you to go back yeah yeah i did that a few tried that a few times can i see your tickets and then you just get up and leave because you know there's no other yeah or uh oh i left them up in my seat yeah yep but uh i don't know yeah i like i enjoy baseball i play a lot of softball  okay um do you have any pets now well we don't right now no we've uh i grew up with uh with pets my folks and i always had a dog and a cat some birds but uh right now we don't have anything yeah oh okay um that a matter of choice or compulsion what about you well we've just um it seems like we've always been at a place where we'd have to go away for the summer or something and uh it was never convenient to have anything i we're thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house yeah yeah uh someplace where there are you know we can take care of it and everything we've got some children who would just really uh enjoy having an animal you know a dog i think and yeah yeah what about you all well right now i'm student and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that um-hum oh no no we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat is that right yeah they're very strict about it but you like uh you like pets and things oh love animals oh yeah i was raised our house when i when i was growing up there was almost never uh at least one cat in the house it's almost almost always at least one cat sometimes you know like fifteen or twenty um-hum but uh always cats in the house oh yeah we enjoyed we enjoyed them uh we like we like pets but um you know you've got to deal with uh taking care of them and and feeding them and everything like that always yeah and our kids are we've got some children and they're not not used to it you know on a daily basis they they uh and how old are your kids oh from fourteen down to seven um okay you've sound like you've got some small ones in the background one our first he's about ten eleven weeks now is that right oh great congratulations yeah yeah uh originally West Virginia where are you from um-hum okay um i don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country but i been to Charleston Charleston West Virginia yes uh-huh okay that's pretty much the south end of the state or the southern quarter of the state anyway um-hum okay in the north end of the state you got that little narrow strip of West Virginia going up between Ohio and Pennsylvania um-hum right at the base of that northern peninsula is my hometown um-hum well that's yeah that's interesting so it's really up north in the country really uh it's i guess uh yeah yeah it's well uh my parents' house is like three miles south of where the Mason Dixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it continued that far gosh i see so pretty nice country up there oh it's beautiful hills or what uh well from my neck of the woods it's hilly um you know um-hum uh maybe three hundred four hundred feet elevation uh that type um-hum variations from the valleys up to the hills to hilltops is it a farmland um not a lot of farmland there mostly it's uh i mean you know there's you know individuals with their own own farm uh growing their own food uh most of the agriculture it's more in the way of uh sheep and cattle oh yes um-hum and even that's you know small time mostly uh the biggest chunk of what's going on there is is uh industries coal mines and chemical plants and power plants sure um-hum okay uh aluminum plants there's like two aluminum plants with you know what are you what are you studying there at Hattiesburg computer engineering oh yeah what year uh just finished up my fourth semester well great yeah yeah i hope that works out well it it's a big change i spent twenty years as a mechanic so yeah was oh did you well you've got some experience behind you in the work force yeah yeah are you uh shooting for a bachelor's now or master's or what i'm working on a bachelor's degree all right okay good i'm working on a bachelor's degree it'll be computer hope it's a good program there pardon hope it's a good program there uh it seems to me from what i've been able to find out that's considered a pretty good program it's nice and small which means you know yep yeah good if you don't get the class this semester then you got to wait three or four semester you know anywhere from two to four semesters to get it again but uh it's it's worth it once you get it hum well yes that's good and probably a good uh student teacher ratio and things yeah oh yeah yeah most the class is pretty small good that works out real well well i was wondering what if you all were to get a pet like if you were to move into an apartment or a house somewhere what would you get uh well um first off we'd probably wind up with a uh cat or maybe a puppy uh i'm partial towards the larger dogs um um-hum um-hum our last we we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus uh had a hamster or two they were they got to be a lot of fun um-hum a hamster um oh yeah uh it's amazing how much character you can  do you do you have a lot of credit cards um no i have i have two actually well that's all i have too yeah i um one of them one of them i use one of them i don't uh one of them is like an American Airlines thing where you get free mileage oh yeah i've heard about those i yeah it's pretty good i use that and i got i'm close to a free plane ticket anywhere in the United States oh that's nice and and the other one is uh um a credit card i got it was a while ago i got it like a free gold card and it's good if i ever rent a car it pays for uh it pays for the insurance oh really so i keep that i never use that one but i happen to be going on vacation soon and i'm going to be renting a car so i'll put it on that card and then if i got an accident they would pay for the insurance yeah they would pay for the accident really really yeah i only have two one of mine's a gas card that i use just for my gas to and from work and the other one's a Visa for emergencies only yeah like if i go on trips and stuff i take it with me in case my car breaks down or something but other than that i keep it locked up yeah i never i never uh like i always pay you know like sometimes i use it out of convenience but i don't i don't run like on a a monthly balance you know i always pay whatever it is that that month yeah i just i make it a habit not even to carry my Visa because i've seen too many of my friends get in deep financial trouble with it um yeah well you can't it sometimes it easy i live in in in New York City and uh if you're going to go out and buy something for a hundred two hundred dollars not that it's such a dangerous place but you know i just sometimes i don't feel that comfortable carrying a lot of money around so it's good to have a credit card to pay for it with that um i use it for that where you live in LA yeah no thank heavens i live in National City which is almost as bad where is that National City it's outside of San Diego oh okay okay and unfortunately there's a lot of gangs around here so it's like i don't carry money and i don't carry credit cards right uh yeah it's probably a good idea but uh yeah but i i don't mind i i don't see what the big deal is with um i i i couldn't see spending more than i had to pay the bill with because eventually it's going to catch up with you i know i don't see how people can do that either but i know a lot of my friends have gotten in trouble deep trouble with them and it's like well why'd you guys do it oh well it's so easy to use right and it's like yeah it's easy to use but you have to pay for it you know didn't this dawn on you but sure sure i got my credit cards through a guarantee agency do you know what that is right uh no you give them you put so much money in an annuity and it guarantees your credit card like say if something happened to you they could still pay off the balance with what's in there right that's cool and whatever your limit is you keep that much in your annuity fund and it's worked pretty good for what i've had it for about five years now and you can take the annuity out the money out of the annuity if you want to but it's just there like you know in case you died suddenly or something right right you know they wouldn't be stuck with the bill cool cool that that's so i like it that way yeah you know they get paid for if you're dead right you know yeah at least they won't be coming after my husband you know saying hey your wife's charged so much money on this credit card we want the money that's true but then again you don't have to deal with him if you're dead so no but i don't know i wouldn't want to leave him and my kids in that kind of a situation that's true that's true but i'll tell you what it comes in real handy when you've got kids cause we went we went on a trip to Arizona we drove there and the car broke down and it was me and my husband and our two kids in that car and Arizona is really hot right and it's like you know if we didn't have that Visa we would've been stuck there in that heat for heaven knows how long yeah that was like yeah like like the first time i ever got a credit card was for that reason because i was in uh where the heck was i i forget where i was i know i was in Europe one time and they ran out of money but i couldn't get money on my credit card either oh i was up i was dating a woman upstate New York and i was up in uh upstate and i had been in college and i guess i took like a hundred two hundred dollars with me or whatever at that time time maybe fifty bucks was enough to live on for a week but i i took some money with me and i ran out of money like at the end of the first weekend i was supposed to be there for a week yeah huh and i needed to i called up my father and i said dad you know go to my bank account and withdraw a couple of hundred bucks or whatever it was and could you send it Western Union and it was a pain in the neck i had to like wait till Monday and you know wait till the office opened and it took time and everything became a pain so what i did was i uh yeah so what i did right after that is i got myself a credit card in case it ever happened again i can always you know buy something on the credit card and and not have to worry about carrying cash around yeah so that was about ten ten twelve years ago and i've always had one since and like you said for that reason it's it's easy you know if you need the cash i couldn't imagine  all right what what uh what are some of your favorite places to uh eat at uh Royal Tokyo Royal Tokyo uh-huh uh-huh um Benihana's okay enchiladas oh all right um and actually Red Lobster so what about you oh yeah well i'm a vegetarian so uh my places are somewhat my my my choices are somewhat limited uh but my very favorite is the Olive Garden i think uh if or or else uh uh El Chico's if i have if i had my choice that's where i like to go oh really yeah i haven't been in Dallas for very long and so i don't know you know too many places to eat yeah uh i guess that would be really hard being vegetarian less but uh it it it is a little bit uh you know there are at almost every restaurant there are uh things to eat it's just depends on you know whether whether what you really want to eat is there yeah yeah i could appreciate that yeah are are you a vegetarian also or uh no no i'm i do eat meat um-hum oh oh yeah oh i guess being brought up that way i do have a tendency though toward chicken and fish seafood uh-huh uh-huh so um what made you choose to be a vegetarian well uh several reasons um um most most importantly i have a uh uh disease in in both of uh in in all of my joints that uh in in which arthritis is a big factor ah and uh several reports uh in the last five years have given validity to the uh to the to the theory that that uh vegetarian diet diet greatly reduces the pain involved with uh arthritis oh have you found that to be true yeah it really it really does work um even to the point now where uh i'm able to run you know to go out running or jogging on a a periodic basis which which was impossible before yeah uh yeah it it it really has helped uh unfortunately um oh well that's great i still i i can't give up uh milk uh-huh so so i drink uh i drink skim milk but if i had my way i'd drink a gallon gallon a day so but but my my restaurant choices then uh oh i guess since i've uh been a vegetarian i've loved fettucini alfredo and so and so ah but any place i go that has that that's what that's what i eat it doesn't doesn't matter oh uh-huh oh well then there's a real good restaurant you should try it's called Rocco's Rocco's uh-huh it's off of six thirty five and i believe it's Centerville uh-huh you can see it from six thirty five it's east of Central Expressway okay and it's an Italian place uh-huh and they have really really good food nice healthy portions and they're really at reasonably priced oh really uh-huh oh good yeah um i'll try that out yeah it's uh yeah my husband matter of fact he works for TI but he and i went there and they have got some of the best bread garlic bread we've ever had and uh uh-huh oh really i think i did have i don't know if it was uh alfredo i might have had the parmigiana uh-huh but it was really good yeah what makes you go back to a restaurant um the food first of all yeah um and then service if the if the personnel there are really attentive and if they really yeah if they really act like they care i mean whether they do or not but if they if they act like they do then those are those are two big things that really make me wanna go back to a restaurant uh-huh right yeah uh-huh and what about you uh i i think more than anything else uh the atmosphere oh really yeah ah which i think you know the the service the the service is is a big part of but but uh uh-huh my very favorite place in the world to eat uh believe it or not is in i went to school in Abilene to uh and and there's a place there's a little restaurant there called the Oxford ah the ah Oxford Street which ah uh-huh uh-huh the food is okay uh uh and uh you know it's it's on the better side of good uh-huh and the service is okay but the atmosphere is just beautiful it's uh you you know it looks like an an old English uh home with uh you know the high back leather chairs and uh uh oh okay the cloth the cloth the cloth uh you know how they cloth the walls with with that tapestry cloth it has that it's it's just really nice and i like to eat in there just because i like the feeling in there uh-huh yeah uh-huh i bet it makes you feel really good yeah yeah makes you hungry well that's um that's pretty good for a restaurant i guess yeah oh yeah you uh that one one thing i found was interesting is i read a a report when i was a an undergraduate that uh was talking about the colors of a restaurant  oh you bet they tell you our topic hm you've got it uh pets do you have pets yes we do uh my wife and i have a dog that's soon be eight years old and we have a a cat which is uh i guess about five years old oh my goodness how about you guys we have a three dogs and two birds at this point parakeets three dogs and two birds what kind of birds you have no kidding enjoy enjoy them oh have a ball with them you let you let them out and let them fly around everything well no because my dogs chase them so if in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their cages oh okay we you know this is like a cruelty joke and i apologize if you're a bird lover but uh we had a parakeet uh-huh and my fault put up our first electric fan and never thought about it knocked that parakreet right right out of the air uh-huh well we had that happen once um my son had the bird back in his room because it's his bird well the first one that we had was his bird and i had the ceiling fan put up and it the bird got away from him one afternoon and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall i thought oh so much for the bird no he's still alive and kicking it kill it oh that's no it killed ours i'll be darned no i guess we didn't have it high enough or he didn't get hit in just the right spot but it threw him up against the wall you know and he slid down the wall well speaking of pets i'll tell you my my kids are older now my both of them are either in or out of college but but we had for years about five years i guess had a my son had a Burmese boa constrictor and oh gosh that thing grew to be seven and a half feet in in length and finally my wife's wife bless her heart got rid of it because i didn't really like it oh i hate them and we also had a one year down in Florida on a vacation for Father's Day my kids years ago maybe uh ten years ago go bought me a skunk from a like exotic pet shop it'd be like it'd had been like deactivated as far as uh oh my goodness smell and everything and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years and and my son left went to school we finally sold his boa constrictor but my son needed some money and we we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars so ah you're kidding so when the guy came over he was infatuated by that skunk so i made him a deal i said you take that skunk and he said i'll sell that snake to you for two fifty i said otherwise i'm gonna give it to this other man so he took the skunk too and the skunk was a good a decent pet but you know it does its little jobbies in the litter box and oh well that's pretty good and it was sort of a neat but they just stink too much oh yeah oh yeah that was sort of fun you i tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover i used to visualize my wife for many times my wife be lying there on the sofa and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body with with its with its head right on her neck oh you're kidding oh and the skunk would be sitting at her feet that the cat would be on the back of the sofa and a dog be running around crazy oh oh my gosh i can not imagine i just i don't do my in fact my brother has a uh a exotic pet shop out in California and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail you know i'm going don't do that because they won't come in my house oh gosh oh my son bought this snake uh someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school and it was just a small thing then but it got to be pretty big and you know you'd feed it you can put and feed him that small mice to big rats and things like that and uh-huh it's just uh too much that snake used to watch our cat walk around i always told my wife i said you know what your friend's gonna get our cat one of these days oh my gosh yeah that's right oh my gosh that is wild oh i just can't do those and the lizards and the oh oh me neither all of those things ugh they they need to stay outside far away from me we're down to a simple dog and cat now and that's the way it should be and haven't had any parakeets for quite a while or birds uh customer of mine has a parrot yeah and uh gosh sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot and that was just mind boggling oh yeah they are so expensive well my son was just dying for a bird and i'm really allergic to them so i i tried to stay away from them except i've gotten real attached to this one and and uh we went down to Canton one time oh gosh are you uh-huh two or three years ago now and he'd saved up his allowance you know and picked him out a bird and a bird cage and and that stinking bird when i brought it home tried to take it out of the little box that they give you yes clamped onto my finger and would not i mean i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage and he has tried to bite me for two years and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends he'll gives me kisses he talks now oh gosh that's neat and it's just hysterical i'm the only one that pays attention to him why sure and i'm a substitute teacher and one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said my mom's making me get rid of the bird we have too many pets i thought yeah right come tell me about it you know come to my menagerie they knew the sucker when they saw one so now we have two parakeets  and they're talking about uh federal government aren't they i'm sure well actually probably any government but the federal one's the big one hm so uh so what do you what do you think in the short term we should be doing to to improve it well i saw a program on it recently and and it said everywhere time they cut you know like fifty five million dollars on a certain thing then they brag about how much money they cut and then they go and spend that money somewhere else and that's why the budget is never balanced right right The Gramm Rudman Act didn't solve the problem they just take all the money that they say they cut and they spend it somewhere else yeah or they you know they pad out their staff or you know spend it in bounced checks at the commissary or huh ah yeah i'm getting pretty kind of disgusted with the uh um the you know the fact that they're counting um a reduced deficit as being some big step right i mean first of all we're we're we were about ready to hit the largest deficit i mean this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever and two a deficit is i mean the deficit is only uh is as as far from a balanced budget you reduce the deficit you you're still not you're still not you're still overspending um-hum right i mean it's it's just the amount that you're overspending and and this is you know and for some reason uh the way that the reporting is going on now it seems like like the uh the goal is to reduce the deficit to some you know still outrageous amount um yeah i i i think in the long term something is going to have to be done with uh sort of the the uh well i mean it's it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process right that you've got um people you know trying to trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected um-hum and uh there isn't any sort of overall accountability and and uh i don't know i guess i suppose that that that the only kind of solution ultimately that we're gonna have is is is exposure and information and and i don't know that that in in general the American people are that interested you know to listen to to as much uh uh you know i mean you're gonna have to know what people are doing and uh you know and how and how how partisan and how and how self interested their their motives are and and take it to task for it um-hum because uh it's not gonna get solved if you know if people are still trying to you know like besides like you were saying you said you know where you uh hey we just you know we just cut defense let me grab some of this money for my state now and then we can throw in some highway bill or we can throw in some you know some other kind of thing and uh it's a pretty vicious uh vicious cycle i don't know well i think they should they should limit the Senate to one term one six year term that yeah that's being batted around i uh my my dad was always a proponent a proponent of that he uh he felt that that would um-hum get people involved who were who were interested in being public servants as opposed to personal servants yeah right and and don't let them come back and and uh keep Congress to um two terms and two years a piece and then it'll be overturning and they won't have the same people there all the time yeah right and then all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their their payoffs and kickbacks and and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence right uh-huh and because that's one of the things one of the biggest things is that um the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another whether it's the oil companies or the automotive companies and like the air bag thing the air bag came out what twenty years ago right and only now they're getting it put in cars you know and the oil companies aren't really aren't responsible you know uh-huh yeah the Valdez proved that and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything it should've been done immediately right yeah yeah i think i think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you you just got to get people um i mean at one point at least on a local level um going into politics is you know what you're doing is is really trying to serve the community right i mean you don't expect to make any money out of it you know maybe you gain a little bit of local fame but um-hum but it's uh you put in a lot of work in exchange for that and and i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are are at all like that you know right no they listen to wherever the money is yeah and uh you know and i think that the the the problem with having you know junior people coming in all the time is that you end up kind of wasting a lot of time with uh you know with inept inept politicians or people who don't know how to deal with the public right yeah they're not as efficient that's for sure but on the other hand maybe that's in a lot of them  Nancy do you have any children yes i have a twelve year old and i've been very lucky i haven't needed child care except for my mom so i've been real lucky i'm a nurse i go to school i mean i go to work early oh um-hum so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school then i'm home to pick her up so i'm very very lucky well that's nice that is lucky well how old um does a child have to be before you have to you get to stop making arrangements for him i wonder well i could do it now but she gets lonely in the morning and i feel better um she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight so um-hum uh-huh well and um it's nice for them not to be alone um you never know yeah yeah she feels that way you know and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there and go to school with but uh-huh we just feel better doing it this way so i don't know what day we'll stop we we were about to stop one day this year and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats and so that is a rule oh no we didn't stop and so so um you know it you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen so even though she's twelve she's still a kid so yes she is you got to be careful well i'm glad you had that um opportunity to have your mom yeah i'm i'm glad too well i I have two kids and uh five and six a girl and a boy and um so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because um uh-huh i'm at home now full time but um when i was going to school i would go to school a time that my husband wasn't you know when he was at home uh-huh yeah so that we would just switch back and forth like that but um it's really scary and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care well i would too because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside and um-hum and i i just don't know what i would do if i had to do that i know the hospital that i work in is big hospital and they provide child care and of course they charge for it but at least all the nurses can leave their children and no um-hum they're always watching them they can eat lunch with them if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them and they feel a little better than if they dropped them off somewhere on the way um well that's nice so yeah it is nice and i know that i have um done some babysitting myself and uh when i was in school and needed extra money and i know how i feel how i felt as a provider of child care that even though you're you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to you know treat them equally and you know better usually better than your own um it's not the same and it made me realize that um no one will love your child as much as you and your mother your right right well that's right yeah right and um the family and no one will look out after them and i just think um so far i think my preference would be rather than to have like a oh a big day care that um what is that like child KinderCare and things like that rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something right i would prefer to have in home care either my own home or a neighbor or something yeah yeah just never know i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced and uh-huh it it was hard to treat her equally with my child they were the same age and they played together and they were good friends but like you said you tend to go more for the other one's side just because you are responsible and so it it got hard and my daughter got jealous and right it is hard um it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends because she had to be there every day so i stopped that after a year because it was difficult to balance it so no no and i know um when i pick my kids up from school they wanna come home and i and i would hate for them to have be picked up by a day care and be taken to another large group situation they do um-hum um-hum i know i know so i think uh my preference would be a small small if i had to find day care would be a small someone that i knew yeah yeah well i would rather do without some things and i know that some parents they both do have to work but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better um-hum and i would never do that i never have done it and i just never would do it i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up so no well that's true because even now when they're gone to school it seems like there's just not enough time left over in the day no there isn't there isn't any time that's true and uh by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time and there's just not enough to time in the day to do anything good quality for them but that's really  yeah okay i'm sorry speaking of air pollution i'm coughing like a dog now um i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution and it just doesn't seem like yeah it it but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home you know and it it's kind of dangerous yeah yeah that's true uh i don't know we live um um-hum well i'm close to Salt Lake and there's mountains um you know all around but sometimes i i think tend to hold a little bit of it in you know really it's it's fairly clean um-hum oh yeah um i think it's a fairly clean city compared to some but you have quite as but you think the mountains and the are kind of a barrier hum that's a yeah i think sometimes it seems to be but that's an interesting thought but uh anyway i don't know i know there's a lot of plants here when i drive down you know along the just along the freeway there's a lot of plants that they're burning things and um-hum um-hum um here in Texas i know a lot of the pretty much every place here is is relatively flat and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of a like a smog problem or something like that i'm not sure oh uh-huh yeah we we have a real fog problem um the last few years just in through December and January it it really it is foggy and seems to just um huh it's kind of like it it just stays for a month it's quite foggy but uh um-hum jeez i don't i don't know what else i know cars i i guess yeah i guess i've never really uh thought about the fact that like in California they they have a lot of smog problems uh-huh and it's real hilly there so that is probably something that plays a big factor i think probably just uh a lot of factories yeah um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that uh-huh yeah that's that's what i see burning a lot and i'm not exactly sure what they're burning i know uh-huh there's some oil companies and and i'm sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the chemicals um-hum um-hum aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of uh special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something oh i don't know i haven't i haven't heard that i know uh i don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything but i know i think they they differ from state to state hum oh okay but um you know that's been a new thing in the last few years and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others i think those uh um-hum what are they the i know a a Rabbit's one diesel the diesel cars yeah they they seem to put out quite a bit uh-huh the diesel oh yeah i don't know a lot of people with diesels unless it's a truck you know huh oh but uh oh well do you um are you working for T I no i don't i work i work in Waco at a TV station so my mother works at TI so that's how i oh oh oh uh-huh and that's how you got involved yeah no we we have um uh my husband's sister lives in Dallas actually and they kind of got it us involved that way yeah yeah do you work at T I oh okay okay oh okay that's interesting yeah but well i don't i don't know much what else causes air pollution um noise yeah noise noise causes air pollution and noise pollution yeah i've got speaking of noise you can probably hear my little yeah that's why i thought of it i thought yes he's he is quite noisy yes jeez i don't know i know that um hum how funny don't dumps you know where you dump all your trash in the they uh yeah and i'm sure that does i know they're always churning that up and i i think they burn a lot there too i oh yeah landfills yeah we just yeah we just had a big uh thing here in Waco they're needing to open a new landfill or to expand onto the old landfill and uh it it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded because they're thinking that their water is going to be contaminated somehow and so they oh well yeah i don't think i'd i'd like that you know we um when we've taken things to the dump just yeah the dump that is uh you know closest to us there's some houses around there and i know that on windy days you know they're always moving the the trash over to different spots and they've got those big bulldozers and you can see the dust um-hum oh yeah um-hum flying and and i'm sure that their homes are really quite dusty and and one one of the big concerns is they have a there's a school right across the highway from the landfill yeah so the parents were really really upset oh is there worried about the their kids getting huh um-hum yeah and they've they've been fighting over it for the last year and they just now approved it so they were gonna try an appeal or something  uh me think a political event that happened this year yeah i well there's David Duke yeah and then there's the dissolution of the Soviet Union yeah those two pretty much take care of everything yeah so what do you think about David Duke well if i was a mind to i might burn a cross on his yard yeah thing that what scares me is some of the things he says i agree with yeah you know i just don't agree with his methods that's true i you know i think that the way to you know cut out the welfare poor is not to cut out welfare it's to provide an equal opportunity for people to make a living uh-huh definitely i agree with that and protect them from themselves um-hum basically you know i've i've seen this very close hand a kid twelve years old can make about three thousand dollars a day dealing crack yeah if he lives to his twenty first birthday it would be a miracle um-hum so we're we as a nation have an obligation to our future generations to provide them some other avenue or yeah to make dealing crack a a crime punishable in such a way that nobody would want to do that and and it our constitution expressly forbids that kind of punishment uh-huh yeah it's like i say what kind of you know what kind of punishment that's three thousand dollars a day that's that'd take some kind of punishment to deter deter deter it yeah i i'm considering doing it you know and i got a job today anyway yeah definitely i mean yeah surely i uh i uh i haven't listened to a lot of his views i just you know the thing about that i kind of concerned me is how they the people now want to keep him off the presidential ballots and stuff well and i've kind of wondered you know really if that's right or right or wrong rarely has anything to do with politics yeah that's true uh what i'm seeing here is that the real problem see David Duke addresses symptoms um-hum he's getting to some some serious issues the real problem is if i work for a man say i work for a guy as a matter of fact i'm going to work for a guy Friday new job uh-huh he sells Kelley tires uh-huh now if i roll in there a brand new set of B F Goodrich tires week after next should i expect my job to be there yeah uh well uh see see what i'm saying yeah you know if you drive onto the Ford manufacturing lot in a Datsun yeah i believe that not only should you be fired you all of your assets should be given over to the government why is that because you're crippling the very economy with which you're trying to survive in oh that's true that's true now i believe in free choice don't get me wrong yeah uh-huh and i'm i figure i'm allowed to drive any kind of car i want because i don't work for a car company yeah i drive American made uh-huh that's just because i'm an American i believe that that's the way you ought to do it uh-huh i mean sure having a Mazda or a Nissan or whatever they're called these days sure that'd be a real status symbol but you ain't gonna impress my neighbors yeah you know my neighbor's driving a thirty year old pick up truck you know well i think you got a point too i can see we do a lot of complaining but you don't see a lot of us you know a lot of people willing to buy the American stuff they're like you say they're all out for that status symbol and you know sure yeah now the last time i bought a calculator i bought one from Texas Instruments um-hum because my wife works at Texas Instruments and uh the next time i buy a computer it will be a Texas Instruments yeah well that makes that makes good sense like i say if we i think we're the of the opinion now that uh somebody's got to support the economy but it's not necessarily going to be the American public they want somebody else to do it because we're not willing you know we're under the impression that somebody else makes a better product or little snazzier or something but they they do make better products the scary thing is we finance their research exactly that's true you know the T I came out with the with the transistor they didn't make beans off of it yeah um-hum yeah we just did the core research and then they put it into some consumer product and make all the money off it yeah you know right exactly you know i i have a real fundamental problem with people who drive a Mercedes and have a Sony TV and scream and holler about the welfare poor i really have a problem with those guys um-hum yeah yeah because they're not doing anything themselves to really help they're exagerrating exagerrating as a matter of fact they're exagerrating exagerrating exagerrating what's it exacerbating the problem yeah they're making it worse i can see i can see i i see what you're saying i used to work for a guy this summer he drove BMW i i quit him oh really i say hey you know what uh was it in the tire business again or no it was in construction oh um i i i see i am a dealer for construction software oh uh-huh i had worked for this company as as an employee  hi hi i'm Carol and i'm calling from Garland Texas yeah uh this is Jan Noak i'm in Dallas oh okay because yesterday i talked to someone upstate i'm not even sure where and my husband talked to people in Utah so um anyway let me press one okay okay um let me see i think we've only planned one family reunion in our life so we don't do this too often i um most of my family's in California but my husband's is in San Antonio and so we did this in San Antonio and um it was an experience that i i won't do again how big a family do you have um well it wasn't that big of a family but um it just got out of hand and um so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and and um how much um beverages we were going to need and this and that and oh it just grew and grew and grew and um when the time came only about half that amount of people came so it wasn't you know you have to really just get an accurate amount and but overall we all had a good time we saw people we hadn't see in a while so did you have people coming from far away no it was all in the San Antonio area uh sometimes it's but it it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing and we're going oh my gosh so well you have you have family lives too close together they see each other too often they uh they don't take that kind of thing seriously uh-huh basically yeah and if uh yeah they they come from far away it's uh it it they take it more seriously uh-huh i think you're right yeah yeah my family's not very big but uh we're kind of your family's from where well i have a a a brother lives in Indianapolis a sister lives in Chicago and my folks live back in Buffalo New York oh no uh i i guess we have reunions about once a year or so uh-huh we got together over Christmas my wife's family they're they're all in upstate most of them are in upstate New York they have regular uh regular family reunions every summer oh those are nice and it's yeah it is it's uh and i'm i'm sure they're a lot more organized too because they've done it before yeah and it's it's just something that they they plan on doing every summer they just have a weekend picnic and uh every year everyone asks when is it happening and where is it happening and they just plan on being there that's great oh yeah that makes a big difference too when everybody's real eager to participate yeah well that's great yeah they they had a family reunion for uh well for my mother-in-law at her seventy fifth birthday and they managed to get just about everybody everybody into town uh last November including a a number of people from out in California uh-huh oh so is uh it it was good it uh it worked out very well um-hum one interesting interesting thing that they did at the time is they um they videotaped the the whole shebang which uh-huh it made a nice remembrance of of the entire party yeah more people want to come back again yeah they want to come back yeah that's good so so that that works pretty well that way my uh my grandmother in California is um which is my dad's part side of the family is planning a reunion um this spring but we won't be going because um i don't know how they thought of this it's going to be on a cruise and um it seems like most of the family is uh going you know all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are going most of them are going but it's too costly for us but anyway they're going to go on a cruise and um it sounds really neat it really does yeah i i can go for that that what what the i i guess interesting if you had uh uh a very extended family that that kind of involved a lot of people that that cousins and things that you don't really know that you've never met it'd be interesting to meet a lot of those people uh-huh yeah uh i don't know how you would go about uh getting them together but that uh would be uh and a friend of mine um she plans her family reunion um every year and they go camping and she says they have the greatest time and she says usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person but she said they all go camping and they have a really good time for the whole weekend so that's yeah i kind of wonder what what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family you know i had hoped that our our kids get together uh at least regularly yeah yeah right now we only have two children so i  okay now then you heard the question what what do you like to do for yourself in car automobile repairs um-hum well i'll tell you i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on than i do now okay i do uh i do the easy stuff now i i change oil uh and then what some people would consider a little more difficult i i'll change spark plugs and um i'll change you know points and you you know the air filters that kind of stuff well but uh i can't do as much as i used to um i used to do a whole lot more but not anymore they're just too weird to work on now is that the reason you're not doing it or are you so busy you don't have time to do it well that's part of it yeah part of it is like you said i don't have time hm well okay well being a female and being alone you i don't do anything but put gasoline in my car and let someone else check the oil even but um have you had any major repairs recently um-hum well um on this car i've got now no but i had a van before and it was only two years old and it had transmission go out on it oh but fortunately that was covered under the warranty okay well you should be very feel very fortunate i had um have a transmission replaced in an eighty six automobile and i'll declare that's an expensive hm oh yeah yes um-hum maybe i should have just traded the car in yeah sometimes it makes me wonder oh it just well i have a very comfortable car and i um-hum have a health problem that i need a large comfortable car so um anyway i have a new transmission and i'm sure that any of them would have um-hum cost almost or charged me almost the same amount but yeah it hurts it hurts real bad did you take it to a dealership no i took it to an independent out in Garland um-hum oh i see i had um these people were recommended by a neighbor uh-huh and you know that's the only thing i am not a native of Dallas oh i see so that means i have to depend on on trustworthy friends right and that's anyway it's fixed it's running and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it um um-hum oh gosh it's gonna have to run for a little for a while yet oh i know it uh-huh it certainly is frightening what work are you in uh i i work for TI i i work in the networking area oh okay okay do you work for TI no okay no no i have just retired from um the Southwest Medical Center oh yeah where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car but they're all too busy so yeah i have to do it the other way and that's find someone and pay them to do it yeah yeah so i certainly hope you have a nice New Year oh yeah i'm i'm planning on it oh it can't be any worse than last year that's for sure oh it could be but i don't much think so i'm well we're starting out a new one so let's make it a good one yeah that's true that's true yeah i'm gonna try and plan on it okay all right well i enjoyed the conversation thank you all right bye-bye all right thank you bye-bye  do you have any thoughts on uh uh uh our jury system yeah actually i i have quite a few thoughts on it before i became a mother i was going to law school because i wanted to change how our law system right now is working oh really uh-huh because it's not it's not working correctly what parts of the of the system would you change well i mean when they pick like when they pick a jury they're supposed to have an equal or almost equal number of men and women to get different viewpoints and they don't have that because the women can't appear in court because they have take care of their kids um-hum right right sure yeah and so they they end up having an all male jury right does the system not provide the system provides uh compensation for wages but they don't provide compensation for like say day care yeah they don't no they don't oh i'm that surprises me i didn't know that and a lot of women have to cancel their appearance and tell the judge hey i can't i've got two or three kids at home that need me you know sure yeah and all the judge can do is say oh okay you're excused uh-huh uh-huh there's nothing the judge can do about it because there's no law that says you know the judge has to help them with day care so he you know they don't bother right and most of the juries if if anybody did a study of most of the juries they'd see that it's almost always an all male jury because women can't leave their kids sure yeah and if they do get a woman on the jury she is beyond the age of fifty huh that's curious i i i never even thought of that uh before um i i i did notice that uh most of the time the juries are males and uh but i'd never thought of any reasons why or why not well i wanted to go to law school mainly for the purpose that if i was doing something in the legal profession i thought maybe if enough people knew about the problem maybe we could do something about it but then of course i got married and became a mother so um-hum um-hum it's kind of taking a back burner right now but i'm i still intend to finish law school i've got two years left uh-huh where where did you begin over in Arizona A S U uh-huh a okay all right but i i just don't think it's very fair right yeah because they say well it's all equal and you know we send papers to this many women yeah but how many do you actually pick because they can appear right right yeah um uh what are your thoughts on uh leaving the sentencing to the judge i don't think that's right yeah i mean most judges that would be fine because they're pretty open minded um-hum um-hum but if someone accidentally got a judge that wasn't and there are judges out there that are racist or prejudiced about one thing or another um-hum people could be convicted just because of personal feelings and i don't think that's right right i think they need more views than just one right that that that that's curious uh i'm i'm currently uh i have been asked to appear in court in Denver County Court uh uh for uh a traffic violation which i kept uh uh i i tried to uh plead not guilty by mail and uh for some reason i really uh hacked the judge off and so now i'm supposed to appear uh in court uh and and so i've been thinking a lot lately about uh first of all what i'm gonna do i don't know if i'm going to uh just go ahead and pay the ticket now pay the plea bargain or or fight this thing to the end i i wasn't guilty and uh but it's almost impossible uh you you know what what really aggravates me is it's impossible it's impossible i'm in graduate school and they set the court date on a Wednesday so to go from Dallas to Denver uh to fight a ticket on a Wednesday would mean i'd have to leave either Monday or Tuesday and be back yeah and i go to school that misses a full week of graduate school well you just can't survive uh missing a full week of graduate school uh and you'd miss school oh yeah no kidding uh and uh it's it's completely absurd first of all that i that i got the ticket and it's completely absurd that i should appear on a Wednesday at court you know i could appear at Spring Break uh you know theoretically and and i wouldn't mind doing that but yeah so i'm trying to figure out what uh what action i'm going to take if any or if i'm just gonna go ahead and forget it all and just pay it to to ease my uh ease my pain but but you know it there there's a point uh i guess you and i being younger uh tend to be a little more idealistic uh uh but but i see uh i i definitely see a an instance now where maybe i won't be as idealistic where where i would be able a uh willing to give up my ideals for uh a little peace of mind and get them off my back which which is new to me i'd never been that way before yeah well a friend of mine got in really  okay uh do you live in a home yes we we it's a house we bought uh about two and a half years ago now uh-huh oh did you uh-huh we've we've lived in ours for about six years we had it built actually and um uh-huh the first house uh-huh yeah it it's our first home too uh-huh so what do you think of of owning a home as opposed to yeah huh to renting somebody else's um well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that we were living in and um that was quite an experience huh i i much prefer having my own home and and uh just the space and and more privacy yeah um-hum yeah do you have is it a fairly large house um it's uh oh it's like twenty four fifty square feet it's a two story yeah how about yours oh that's a pretty good size yeah uh-huh it's tiny it's not much bigger actually we had an apartment two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is so yeah it's uh it's only like eleven hundred square feet is it small oh really oh uh-huh do you do you have children just one yeah but it it uh all the rooms are small i i mean but it ends up giving us three bedrooms which we wanted yeah and uh use an extra one for an office just one huh oh oh uh-huh yeah which is handy i'd rather have have more rooms and less space in each one i guess rather have lots of rooms and lots lots of space but uh that ends up costing me oh yeah yeah well like um how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood well they're the it's pretty typical i mean it's it's a very very middle class neighborhood uh lots of lots of young couples with you know usually oh i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood that's their first homes and uh oh uh-huh lots of kids and and stuff and so it it fits well in the neighborhood it's it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood but on the other hand it's clean and kind of suburban yeah little bit more than i want yeah uh is is yours also pretty much in conformance with a neighborhood or is it um yeah it it it it does it it seems about oh probably average um uh-huh that our neighborhood has a just a wide variety of of um people and you know there's older people here and and um people that are about our age we're in our thirties and um there's a lot of kids a lot of kids people the people across the street have eight uh-huh uh-huh wow eight kids oh my gosh yeah uh-huh yeah their home just burned down matter of fact and um last summer and they're just rebuilding and um their house is going to be really big they're ooh i'm sure with eight gosh yeah they're building it up bigger he's at um uh oh not an obstetrician an an orthopedic surgeon and um so since the house did burn they're they're going it's quite different than it was before and it's it's a lot bigger uh-huh uh-huh yeah and um but ours is about it's you know it's a nice nice home it's it's definitely not one of the the smaller ones and um it's not the biggest either but yeah neighborhoods i mean they'll they'll they'll tend to to be real tight about that uh especially newer neighborhoods my my brother just built a new house uh um he he lives in Wichita Kansas and the um uh the neighborhood actually fought him on it because he he was um the house was gonna cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood oh now that's because he was he's doing a lot of it himself and you know for example landscaping and and lots of the other stuff and his house actually ends up being nicer than lots of other in the neighborhood but but they were they were pretty touchy on it he was a little surprised yeah yeah you you know that's interesting you say that because we do have we have those architectural codes here and when we um put our house in um they wanted us to have there was one uh-huh we have part siding it on on the two story part and then on the back and they there was one side where our chimney was and just the chimney was gonna be brick and they wanted us to have more brick so we ended up having to go halfway up um-hum uh-huh uh-huh which it does look nicer and you know we would have liked to have had all brick but of course at that point we couldn't afford it and but it's funny that you'd say that because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all so it's kind of like they were right kind of depends on when they get in you know yeah yeah and i and so it was kind of like it's they ours is the last street that they built on so the houses actually on our street are a little bit they've kind of gone a little bit nicer um-hum oh they have it's got yeah yeah oh yeah i mean just they you know it's like the second phase and and so they've kind of changed the the codes a little bit and so that's kind of why i guess they stuck us with more brick when there were other homes that didn't have any and uh-huh hum well my see my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that because they they moved into a neighborhood and bought a a real nice stone house down in in South Austin and um oh uh-huh and what the builder apparently plans to do is they they do phase one and they they kind of give it a very upscale and and very tightly controlled um codes and and and stuff and then they come back in and and and then they sell
