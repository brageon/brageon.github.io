 so tell me where do you get most of your uh news information from well i i subscribe to two different newspapers the Gwinnete Daily News and the Journal so morning and afternoon and i guess that's where i get most of it and then i always whenever i'm in the car i'm listening to WGST or WSB and uh read the news uh reports on the computer networks and uh uh i'm kind of addicted to Headline News and C-SPAN and CNN so i get it from everywhere i guess but most of the details from the newspapers yeah sounds like it yeah a lot of people uh don't get any newspapers and you're getting two that's uh definitely kind of shows your interest in it yeah um so do you do that for uh because um the morning journal paper is got more of uh a liberal or type bias oh pretty much uh yeah i you know it in terms of the choice between the Journal and the Constitution i'd take the Journal because it carries more of the conservative columnists uh-huh um and also didn't want to take two morning papers and since since i live in Gwinnete County i want to take the Daily News to get their Gwinnete coverage and it doesn't make sense to take two papers in the morning um-hum taking the journal in the afternoon means you're get some of the some of the news up until their deadline which is about eleven or eleven AM or noon uh which you wouldn't get uh until the next day with the Constitution um-hum right so the uh Gwinnete paper that's owned by uh is it Wall Street Journal well New York Times New York Times okay and uh so it's kind of strange they they're they're they're generally uh fairly conservative but some of the columnist they they publish are from the New York Times syndicate and from other newspapers owned by the New York Times um-hum so it's uh they tend to be really uh really liberal uh-huh uh and i i i actually think probably uncharacteristic for Gwinnete County but it it's still interesting to hear or to to read uh you know different perspective on issues um-hum so this something that you do uh just for your own personal interest it doesn't have anything to do with your job you're not in a job where you need to keep up on these current events well i do keep up on current events in the high tech industry particularly data communications for my job but uh main reason i keep i keep up on current events is because of my interest in politics okay uh-huh i'm you know active in politics and uh uh oh really you going to run for elected office well i ran for State Representative in the election in nineteen ninety and running for probably going to run for State Labor Commission this year uh-huh kind of ambitious but yeah that's good how did you do in you your first uh run election well i um i i was i run as a Libertarian and uh it was a three way race i got eight percent of the vote which is not bad for a third party in a three way race um yeah for a third party right yeah and you probably uh you know more and more people are probably leaning toward that third party now the way things are going well i hope so the way that's becoming pretty clear that the other two aren't doing that great of a job huh right hum so where do you get your news uh i guess newspapers uh i get i subscribe to the morning um the Constitution um uh-huh publication uh journal publication for uh i guess that would be more of keeping up in terms of the work that i do uh-huh um magazines US News and World Report Time magazine uh a lot of yeah yeah i subscribe to several magazines too uh-huh yeah and you know things like Sports Illustrated uh computer magazines uh uh i don't know if you read the National Review um-hum i subscribed to it at one time um but there was a period uh where i really felt that i was reading too much now now now i've got four kids and a fifth on the way now and it's hard to find time to read as much as i did oh wow um-hum so i've cut my monthly magazines back to just uh oh i guess three or four sure things like uh uh Reason which a lot of people don't even they don't even know what it is it's a it's a Libertarian magazine but it's uh has a lot to do with uh free markets and privatization and things of that nature i i don't know what that is no um uh-huh and uh the Freeman which is another uh Libertarian uh more of a philosophical uh type journal rather than a uh news sort of thing um-hum and uh oh a couple of others but uh i don't tend to subscribe to the the major news magazines or things like that um-hum so uh what you're in the you're an engineer yeah i work for uh uh  what kind of car are you driving now no i'm well driving a Hyundai Sonata uh-huh do you like that one no we like it real well uh-huh yeah we haven't had the only problem we've had is the valve cover gasket leaking other than that it's been working real good how long have you had it uh two years uh-huh my car that was the main problem i've ever had with it is i guess twice i've had to get the valve cover gasket replaced and once the gasket around the the um oil pan um-hum it's uh nineteen eighty two Cutlass Sierra and it still drives pretty well though i had kind of low mileage on it yeah well this um like i said we've had this for two years and it almost got forty five thousand on it wow that's a lot of driving yeah wife does a lot of driving she she uses it a lot and then we have the second vehicle the Nissan pickup uh-huh i think that um i might've done better to get a pickup for the use that i've put mine to but um i didn't get it i didn't get that i got a car and that's there have been times when i was glad to have a car but most of the stuff i've done has been hauling around and i've been better off to have a pickup yeah well our next vehicle is going to be a a full size truck well we're kind of getting little a full size pickup yeah uh Nissan is just a a mini truck um-hum and it's not real big for a family so right what do you think you'll get a um step side or a a smooth split side i'll probably get a fleet side yeah my daddy use used to always get a step side and because he has cows and the cows he can with a step side you can haul cows in the back because there aren't those humps for the tires yeah but this last time he decided to still get a step side even though he couldn't find a step side in the long full length they only had them in the short length yeah that's that's all they make them in now i think so he was disappointed in that but he still went with the step side because he thought it was easier to get in and around it and take things off the truck and so on without always having to come out the back yeah but he uses it on the farm and he built himself a cow trailer so it he didn't need the length so much anymore yeah yeah yeah like i say like i'm we're kind of moving out in a mini truck and into the full size will be the next one so do you just use it for your own purposes and hauling your family around oh yeah plus you know i help friends move here and there and stuff and we kind of getting to the point where it's it's we're going to do a lot of camping and stuff during the summertime and the mini truck just doesn't work very well so right do you have if you're going to go camping are you going to have to drive you car to take your family camping plus drive the truck oh no no um the what we'd probably do right now is just use the car and try to put everything in it that we can right and then later on we're going to try to get a uh camper trailer once we buy a new truck well even though i could've probably used a truck better the last time around i probably will still get a car the next time around figuring that'll be more useful in the future yeah so i don't know i'll probably look for something that has a dealer everywhere i would like to drive oh yeah i can understand that that'll be the main criterion yeah i guess the Japanese makes though do are starting to have dealers all over though i don't know about how the Hyundai dealer network is well its pretty good uh we had one and then he closed and now we got another one here right near us so um-hum it's it's all right uh like i said the only problem we really had with our car just a valve cover gasket leaking and since they fixed it under warranty it was we haven't had any problem with it that's true that's a good point i remember a long time ago my folks got a Chrysler but the nearest Chrysler Chrysler dealer to them was over fifty miles away yeah and it weren't all that good of a car they had pretty many trouble with it um-hum pretty much trouble so whenever it would break down and take it back to the dealer they'd have to to nurse it along  well Doug what are they doing in your community in Pennsylvania about recycling okay well some stuff i go to Penn State up here and the town recycles quite a bit actually they collect curbside uh-huh gone the day that the garbage goes and they recycle um tin and aluminum cans and glass and newspaper basically uh-huh so the the people have to separate it out is that um no actually the um garbage crew does that you just put a you know plastic plastic recycling bin out on the curb every week and now except for having the paper bundled people don't really separate at all oh yeah how about at Penn State do they recycle things like uh computer paper and that sort of thing um yeah they do although there's just recently been a problem with them uh like saying that they weren't able to afford recycling everything anymore so that they um they stopped recycling newspaper on campus for instance oh yeah they stopped recycling glass so they're only doing cans and white paper now which i think is kind of insane oh because it's really not that expensive well what i've uh learned about recycling is that it's almost impractical to recycle newspapers um-hum which is sad and and as a matter of fact i'm member of a civic organization where we had someone from the city of Dallas come talk to us about recycling and the whole key to recycling is demand yeah um-hum the supply is there people are willing to do it yeah but for example until they figure out how they can strip the inks off of used newspapers effectively cost effectively um-hum then it's not gonna happen yeah and and there are whole huge warehouses in Dallas full of used newspapers and i think they actually are building some sort of a plant in Texas where they can strip the ink off um-hum i see i know at work we recycle white paper and cans like you said um-hum uh the city of Plano is actually doing quite a bit they recently started picking up um glass aluminum and and they will take newspapers too okay and it apparently doesn't have to be sorted they haven't quite reached my neighborhood yet but they're doing all sorts of smart things uh i see they no longer allow grass clippings to be bagged up in plastic bags and put out by the trash um yeah that's definitely good yes if you want to bag you know if you if if you don't want the clippings left on your lawn you can bag them in biodegradable bags which means paper um-hum which you can buy from the city yeah and and they're great until it rains and then they start biodegrading um-hum but they are uh contracting with someone to turn all these clippings into mulch oh that's great and i don't know whether i don't know whether it'll be available to the to the citizens of the town or whether it will just be used in the parks and recreation department or something i i don't know i guess it really doesn't matter um-hum but it's uh uh since they won't take any yard waste it's that's in plastic bags it's a little bit annoying when you're you know pulling up your vegetable garden at the end of the season and that sort of thing um-hum and you don't have any of the their special paper bags on hand because you haven't bagged your clippings at all you just let them recycle themselves yeah i she see but uh i don't i this for a rather small town well hundred thousand people or so i guess this pretty progressive community um-hum uh is it happening much in towns like it in Texas um i don't know about statewide i think i think in the Dallas area there are few other uh suburbs Plano's a suburb that uh are doing things about recycling yeah um-hum but it in order for it to be cost effective you have to have customers for it you have to have people say i won't have i won't buy paper unless it's recycled right right right because i mean right the plan of the state college originally was that the recycling would pay for itself and all that and the people's garbage rates would actually go down and of course if hasn't happened that way  so John um what things in your life do you find to be invasion of privacy oh uh lots of things salesman uh keeping records of everything that's sadistic on me i consider that to be an invasion of privacy privacy and i find that it's um-hum i guess not not to the extreme of wanting to to to drop out of society and not have credit cards and not have uh you know cars or credit credit cards or anything uh uh i deal with it but i do considered that it has it's uh potential um-hum negative side with a um i was thinking about it you know when i was waiting waiting to talk to you and i couldn't think of any any real um anything that really bothered me in everyday life um although the thing you mention probably or probably everything about them probably would be true but um couple of things though that i did think of there where um a friend of you you your live in Georgia also so um you know how what if you if you if you get pull over to get and you get a ticket um-hum the um the cop will staple your the ticket to your license so you know when you go to court you will be able to get your license back um someone point it out to me you know that a lot of cops when they pull you over will seal your um driver license to fill how many how many um staple holes are in it yeah you know usually you know and and well you know that's how they give you a ticket or not give you a ticket yeah they say you know you know how weather weather weather weather you you you've been sited how you know that many time or not you know and someone pointed it out to me that you know yeah that that is really an invasion of privacy in that you know you weren't necessarily convicted for any of those offenses you know um-hum well you know that uh for all we know we don't know what's on what's on their data base before all we know when actually call uh call in to check on us uh there may be a little print out says that uh arrested seven times convicted none um-hum um-hum um-hum i mean there maybe maybe that kind of detail involved he may be called upon it may uh the next yeah that's true the next move is to have terminals in their in their uh cars um-hum well i think some states actually have them i know well i'm just saying uh universal um-hum i mean that that and and i well i in fact actually i consider radar detection to be sort of an invasion i think that that uh we have uh entirely to much uh um-hum regulation i think that if you take the old philosophy of you know when you when you catch him you convict him that's a healthy philosophy then well we know that you are going to do it so were going to watch you all the time um-hum um-hum yeah that presume guilt really bothers me well the thing is that even though even though i will probably do that even though i am guilty uh if someone uses uh uh human judgement instead of just making the rules they find out that um-hum um-hum i don't put any risk to other people in certainly not any any risk comparable to um-hum oh let's say granny out on Sunday driving forty five and pulling into my lane when i'm beside her um-hum um-hum uh i could drive a hundred and ten and be safer than most of Sunday drivers on their um-hum i mean i mean a hundred and ten relative to everybody driving fifty five that's how that's how bad of drivers are out there now that have license um-hum it's the other uh problem of privacy i i i think uh i think that uh company's intend uh tend to have to much uh they want to know to much about you and i really think they are only right is weather or not i do my job yeah um you know i i'm i'm about to graduate and i'm still trying look for a job and you know it really offends me you know that company's most company are drug testing you know not that i have any thing to worry about but just the actual invasion of my privacy you know and that um-hum i mean it seam like they don't they don't want want you know hire me they want to own me that yeah that that has been the present philosophy i mean uh i think something that kind of bother me that this is not a privacy i don't think this is a privacy issue but i'm not sure um-hum uh i don't like morals uh people's uh i guess i should call it Southern Baptist morals that determine whether or not someone can go to a club weather it it not that it's legal or not legal anymore now its uh and i i give the the example is news club says that they just regulated by not allowing them  so you're looking for a car well actually not but i'm all ways looking at them you know you know yeah it uh yeah i know that feeling mines about ten years old now so debating weather to run it into the ground uh-huh put up with those headache or get something new hum you know am convince that um it's always cheaper to repair than replace and uh you know if you replace there are other reason for doing it like you want you know my my answer to a car is it's okay if it ugly um it okay depending on the amount there is a bunch of other things that okay that it is it got to be reliable there is no excuse for that right that's number one well that and safety yeah yeah safe and reliable um-hum well safety is subjective i think um you know one person criteria of safety is maybe a little different from another person well i think yeah that's true but reliability you know if it's not reliable it's not safe well the you know not reliable company it it will never start in which case extremely safe well may be not if you're on the Trans Alaska highway yeah that's true there are places where you can starve or freeze to death if your car want start um for a while i was a proponent of Saab's and um i have had two of them and one was a tremendous one disappointment from a reliability view point and um basically i decided to get rid of it before the warranty ran out uh and i think i was cured of the European motoring mystic at that point well the Saab does have a lot of good features and the reliability is uh like one of the few things i worry about with Saab um have you own one or no i haven't but uh you know look looking around it does seem like a roomy guess i'm good handling you know if it weren't for the reliability in every other respect the car was wonderful drove great ton of room very very safe but front wheel drive which with me a plus but i just keep having um string of minor malfunctions yeah exactly yeah and um just the process of have to pay for these thing you know also the increments is what a hundred and fifty dollars two hundred fifty every time you take it to a mechanic and touch it hundred dollars hundred dollars hundred dollars oh yeah well that's yeah that's the other drawback of Saab is that they are not really cheap yeah its can of funny because um i was having it repaired at this place called Import Only and um this guy's comment was and i asked him you know you you repair them all what do you think is best kind of reliability and he kind of get a Japanese car um that starting to fall out of fashion these days oh yeah a lot of flag waving going on uh yeah you know i'm convince that well you it kind of interesting is what i'm driving right now is a Ford Probe which is manufactured in a Mazda factory in Illinois so i'm not sure weather it's an import or not well that's a serious problem if your concerned with that i don't its possible the where things are built anyone yeah it's fake it's fake because see i mean even if i i'm sure the um you know if you take the most Americanized in American cars and you know pry open one of those computer you will find a computer chip that were assemble in Singapore and so forth uh it's just difficult difficult oh yeah you know i mean it's got funny coming once just before and um equal the orange juice was label concentrate manufactured in the United States and Turkey who would have though of it apple say orange apple apple juice and turkey yeah its probably own by a European country company that's employing Mexican very probably you know its um yeah i think the ideal of um yeah its interesting because you know the location um you you know don't seem to uh you know you you can work over several thousands of miles not like it once was use use to be they request uh penalty for uh doing it but i don't think it's true any more yeah it seems like a oh well transportation does still cost and so yeah absolutely um you know but there may be other bigger factors so if you decide to replace this ten year vehicle what what is the prime contender right know well uh i was i was actually thinking of the Saab nine thousands yeah i own one but there's a there's a few other hatchbacks yeah no well i have it a Toyota and i like the Toyota's yeah um which kind it's a a Supra uh-huh so it handles really well so i'm reluctant to get anything that handles poorly yeah uh you would like the Saab have you driven one um i drove a nine hundred about five years years ago um-hum yeah it was very nice well i had had a nine hundred which i replaced the nine thousand nine thousands is the one that gave me a lot of problems uh um i happen the think the nine hundreds is a uh i like the nine hundred better it it had more of the Saab weirdness which really attracted me yes uh i don't mine ugly yeah um you know it's um in fact i really don't  what are your views Mister uh i think Vietnam war was justified but it was carried out badly unfortunately politician got a hold of it and it was a military victory but it was uh i'd say uh a political defeat what what what do you think about of world i mean the Vietnam War well i'm just not really still not really sure why the war started uh there was a conflict with the Vietnamese had conflict with the French i i know that and they've been in a war like state for seems like most of the time that their countries been prospering so they're just award tarnation no uh from what i remember was uh the French had a Vietnam as a colony uh-huh and then after the war World War II uh Vietnam wanted to become independent of of France uh-huh so they started an up rising and that was the French and oh Chinese War uh-huh and and uh basically Vietnamese Vietnamese where beating the French so we took over because we had our containment policy and uh the north side of Vietnam went to Russia for military aid and so we didn't want so we didn't want Vietnam become communist so that's why we started supporting the South Vietnamese Vietnamese that's how the war started does oil come into the equation all of that is there oil in that area see oil is a a motivating factor for most of the uh altercations that go on in the world but it's not necessarily oil i i i know you are talking about like uh natural resources but i don't think they had that much of a natural exactly to much natural resource it's just like i said our we had a containment policy and if we didn't help the South Vietnamese um-hum the North Vietnamese would have definitely won and then our views in those days they would have become communist or pinko um-hum so we didn't want that so we got into the war what about what do you think about strategic location just as if you think about it Russia has Cuba which is an island outside the United States and United States has Japan that's right out side of Cuba it it does Vietnam have a any strategic location uh-huh uh actually i i i really haven't considered that much about a strategic location um-hum hum uh other than it being another country falling to the to pinkos or the communist no not to much real strategic location it's just uh for for Russia to continue it has to expand if it doesn't expand it'll collapse um-hum so by doing our containment policy we're defeating Russia um-hum i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best uh-huh but that was our our little view then i sort of believe that the Vietnam because of the Vietnam war and the the way that the United States exited from it that that has brought on other scrimmages and i i thinks that that's some what related to the Gulf War because it makes the American people keep safe face uh i i i agree partial with you the Vietnam War made us loose loose faith uh politically and and that and and to the fact that the American public can't stomach war or high causality so we aren't really steadfast in that regard but military we unquestionably you know unquestionably quick ass in Vietnam um-hum uh it might have had probably did have some repercussions repercussions towards now you know people do the enemy does know if the America takes high causality it will leave um-hum just like in uh uh that uh a car bombing or three hundred marines were killed and we just got the hell out from um-hum um-hum is this is this something in your in your military in your military training that that uh suggests that that is a um procedure of the of the American way of war uh what what is uh low causality or high causalities right is there you know like there  how do you fill about drugs testing will i'm sorry i have i had mixed fillings about it um at originally i thought all man i'm all for it totally then you know and then um um-hum uh after i got to thinking about it after it's been around a while now i think well it's there's you know uh maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know um-hum yeah i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think that's a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldn't mind taking it um-hum but i do also believe there are times when um you you can come out on the bad end of the stick you know uh because of it well yeah i'm i'm more of the uh i'm kind of more against it than i am for it i i think that people i think people should more be they should be judge on you know their performance and i yeah yeah sure i guess it kind of seems to me that's it kind of a you know yeah the positive you the test type thing that you know people should pay attention to how there employees are you know the supervisors that's right that's right and then should keep an eye on them i i think that should be the the deciding factor in um-hum yeah well i agree with that to i mean if you can if there is a reason you might think you need to check them maybe so but um if there doing good performance if i had a good record yeah that's a good point you know why why should you and it also kind of i mean you know i don't know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like it's um it's kind of a personal you know your yeah sure checking you know your body and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can that's right that's right and um really really where what's the next step you know yeah and uh cause myself i drink and uh you i'm i'm sure that you know when will they you you know get get away with testing other things yeah exactly yeah i mean that's a drug as well it's just that's true that's true and what's what's really the difference there alcohol is worst than a lot of drugs that they might uh consider illegal you know and um but they um uh uh-huh that's true i mean i know in alcohol i mean if you if you drink the night before and what if you have the test the next day maybe that will be the next step is alcohol testing you know breath analyzers or something uh-huh well right now with a with air line pilots and stuff i i now my stepfather works for Northwest Airlines and they had a yeah yeah a thing a a while back and he knew one of the guys that got in trouble for i guess he had gone out the night before uh-huh uh-huh and um had had to much to drink and you are not suppose to drink within i think i think it's like twelve hours or twenty four i know there's a certain uh-huh before they go a back on there jobs yeah before before they get back on the job and and he had been been within that time period yeah right yeah and yeah that's that's that's yeah i know it's they got they came down on on him hard for that i'm sure he did and he was probably perfectly capable you there was nothing at all that he couldn't have done you know as far as his job yeah yeah it just change it vary so much from person person to person is it's a subjective type thing you know that's true that's true yeah and uh i mean i never thought about it but you know you may drink and uh drink a hole lot one night and you may be going out going somewhere the next day like Sunday afternoon and you you be perfectly fine all over again and uh if they did a test on you you might not pass you never know you know just just from the night before and um you know that's that's sort like the drugs testing you know um-hum and it it seems there there are a lot of profession now it seems like um you know am sure the president of the United States doesn't get drug tested but he's got a lot of responsibilities and that's right yeah uh as as seems like you know some things yeah if there are going to do it you know like i know a lot of government um jobs are yeah that's that's true yeah that's true require drug testing you know it seems like they should uh not right i know what you are saying be you know they should not be hypocritical about it that's right if you know um if you know if they're going to do it just do it totally nation wide every job there is you know or or else you know just don't do it they having such a big problem with the i mean it makes good sense the drug war anyway its yeah really i mean that's where the real problem is i mean um but where i work uh i think they have talked about it you know and uh but nothing like that has come up at all you know yeah uh-huh am surprise they they don't work i work for uh Georgia Tech Research Institute i'm a student employee and they have got a yeah uh-huh you know we work on a lot of government project and stuff but um but you know some of them require yeah yeah i mean some people are working with some kind of classified information but non of that i think right right but uh they don't require any type of testing there and i remember i was in uh yeah yeah i was in the Air Force for uh a little while and they had a random type thing going yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh so every i mean every i mean i'm a rejoining basic trainer or right right just one mourning like every one from you know this flight or what every would be tested sure sure it's kind of a random thing right right but then i know of some other jobs  uh actually it took me quite a while to get someone uh about six minutes so i have had some time to think about this and you know what is been done and what's could be done and should be done um i think up to this point and time the problem with uh recollection or waste what ever is that it is sort of on a voluntary uh bases were you know have to actually except personal effort to make it happen you know like take your papers to the um-hum uh recycling center you take this uh one place or another and um in Portola Valley where i live the i gets i use garbage company i don't know what they do in Mountain View but uh yeah we have our own uh they have a program that uh they send a truck through basically you don't have to do anything all you have to do is put your papers uh out put your bottle out in a bag put your paper out in a bad and they do the recollection for you basically they come by in a cycle quite a bit like garbage pick-up um and in fact yeah that that that also what they do here in Mountain View in fact there is um uh for each area like for our area there is a person who a recycling block leader where i don't know if it's that way were you where they put up a sign um telling people in the community that it's uh the recycling day coming up the next day so that people are aware of it and so people are it's a reminded to tell people to do that and yeah where even uh an official recycling block black liters of i see oh okay for our area the other i now some people living in New Jersey and they said where they live um its mandatory that you do recycling and if the garbage people and i don't know how thoroughly they they check this but if they find certain essentially contra banned um the garbage is inspected things in your uh yeah basic basically your garbage is being inspected if they find certain contraband things in there you can be fine for it it oh that's interesting yeah i i thought that was really amazing and it uh it's sort of another way of uh uh encouraging or try new uh enforce that that type of um proper behavior well i think the only way to make it really successful is to make it as easy as possible for people and i i think that uh practice here uh you know i lived previously in Dallas up to uh a year or so ago practice here of sort of making it an automated part of garbage pick-up uh seem to be a step forward yeah i think it i think it's true and i think that um do you think it would help if there were um financial incentives like you know were people bring the um uh there cans and um and you get a penny a can or something do you think those type of uh remediation are to well my sister-in-law lives in northern Wisconsin and they have a financial system there actually i can't recall exactly what it is but you have uh sort of a free pick up of sorted garbage if you sort it and it's actually pretty tedious sorted or sorted sort of sorted not free pick-up the uh free pick-up of sorted garbage uh but you its actually pretty probably some of that to nitpicking how you have to sort it uh and for sorted garbage uh indiscriminate garbage there is a fee oh a rather exorbitant fee um-hum oh really if you mix and match things improperly uh well uh uh uh it i guess in it this is also a subject inspection as you well mention but uh i a it basically on an all name basics if you this the uh sorted stuff that you put out is uh quite a healthy fee for for picking that up and i think it's free or something like that for the stuff that is sorted huh yeah around here also i'm in Mountain View and i presume in this whole area i expect that the kind of pick-up that that you have in Porta Valley and we have here are now very common uh at least in this area and we also have um uh day when there's um uh two days a year when there's hazardous waste um drop-off were we've dropped off things like cans of paint that are in or garage and drop-off um other things hum um-hum uh and its a different sort of recycling but it's also uh very helpful to keep stuff from going down the drain and into the water system and wherever else that goes and i don't know what they do with the one that happen seems like it's a uh significant problem for thing that you don't won't people to put down the drain and i don't i don't know if those go into landfills or right i don't know landfills actually don't seem like a good solution either for them yeah yeah it would be nice if we had a continuing cycle here where every  so what do you sell them or what uh don't don't bit your tongue no no actually i'm a system engineer and uh i i'm sitting right know before there my Mac is at my right hand and my DOS machine is at my left hand and alright i've got a Mac in front of me as well good for you yeah well i it's weird um where i came from they were all IBM oriented because i'm a doctoral student at UCF University of Central Florida um-hum um-hum and i IBM got to the campus first a long time ago and established themselves so i was real IBM format when i came up here to Minnesota uh-huh but now up here everybody at Honeywell is Macintosh oriented or Sun or Silicon Graphics or what ever give me a graphical interface any day huh well i don't know yes yes and no in a way i find almost that i am slower on graphical interface than i am on textural yeah it seems to be the great equalizer that's one thing that i've notice is uh you you put uh open windows on a sun and i don't see amazing power from it it doesn't degrade as much under a load as a typical um-hum yeah like an intel chip would but uh it it like i said i i i consider GUIs as a great equalizer you know they help people work but they seem to bring all of the machine to there knees right so because yeah that true actually i'm i'm kind of interfacing interested in uh i'm a human factors person oh really that's interesting work yeah yeah that's what my doctorate degree going to be in so i'm kind of interested interested in the interface of the whole anyway you know but uh uh-huh that would be um who who do you work for this is a great time for you to be into it you know well yeah yeah i hope so actually interfacing is not really my forte i'm more into uh aircraft displays and controls um-hum oh heads up this ways and such well yeah stuff like that generally i'm right now my dissertation is more into auditory display but uh you know things like beats and buzzers and tones and stuff oh so are you a Star Trek fan uh yeah actually i've heard a lot of really uh good thing from human factor people about the way that they you know the the the bridge of the new enterprise um-hum yeah yeah that that seems to be a pretty good pretty good thing as for as i can tell who who do you work for in Rochester i work for a company called Western New York Computing System for twenty year old company and uh we are affiliated with MicroAge i know that oh okay yeah makes people some people squeamish but uh well not me yeah uh you know it's a it a it's fascinating work and uh it would never never a dull moment you know yeah i can say you know for me shoot in the last five or six years if i hadn't had access to a computer i would really be screw in a big way you know because i've um-hum i had a i use to have a IBM compatible and i got my my thesis done and actually my master degree on it and now that i'm trying to work on my dissertation you know it just it's really good that i've access to a Mac and stuff so oh yeah yeah it's helped on yeah you can just you know you can just type type type type get it all in there and make it look really excellent and uh some of some of the checkers and thing they have nowadays or you bet yeah yeah you can build the fancy art work and stuff are a real benefit oh yeah sure i even seen uh you can download a three dimensional yeah uh Chemical CAD oh yeah small package that lets you draw molecule in three dimension and huh scary stuff you know well that's pretty nifty yeah well what do you think about Unix in terms of it's popularity if do you think that is going to blossom or what well i'm a little worried about um you know uh what do they call it a government poses yeah but um because it could it could fragment it but the government has brought into that type of operating system know and the government seem to derive um-hum uh you know there is a whole other offshoot people company will developing for that market and then turn around and sell those products into the commercial markets and so i think were going to see a lot in there it's got a lot of promise i don't right i mean it's it it's been underrated um you know you can you can scale the Unix system yeah um-hum to fit the need you know you can go all the way from a desktop to a mainframe yeah now that's that's the real good thing is the versatility and everything i i've got a lot of friends that work at NASA and uh and Cape Kennedy and things and there all really like on Unix um-hum really pro Unix and like that's the future of mankind in computing you know type of thing and i'm not i'm not real certain that i agree with that but well i i'm i use to be um a very strong Apple supporter and i was a little worried about this unholy alliance that they have entered into with no with IBM with Microsoft or with IBM yeah but um you know there there there's a company called Talogent that's uh third spin off of both of the company it's like there there spawn and uh there working on an object oriented operating system that is going to hold a lot of promise yeah hum no uh um that's  Jeff what do you think are you paying to much in taxes i certainly think that in some cases i am but uh i think it's mostly on the federal area were i don't see as much maybe for for my money as uh i might uh i thought of school taxes as well and i was very involved in schools uh in the local community a couple years ago and it was pretty easy to see where it went all there but i guess i have the same opinion that some American have that uh uh it's all fat how about you well i i i'm one of those that i'm kind of glad i don't get all the government i pay for i tell me more i don't understand well i just ship off so much money to the federal government and if they really uh took it and and did things to govern me well that would be a lot more government than what i think i need uh oh uh the one i guess that on a daily basis the one that bother me is the sale tax i'm paying eight and a quarter percent on sale tax yes at yeah that that adds up yeah and and you know you you put put your money down on the counter thinking that is enough to pay for it then you need another dollar because you had not guess right on the sale tax uh-huh it certainly adds up quickly yes and i've heard it said that of course that effect that effect us across the board in terms of social economic uh areas everybody pays that sale tax oh yes um i guess that's i i guess i'm luck here i only pay five percent and that that sound great to me well if you want to move here uh all you have to do is find a job so i guess you trade things off one way or another yeah i suppose so yeah there there has been a lot of going on in Texas in term of financing schools uh there some judge decide that we had to have pay equal amount to students i mean you know education dollars per student all across the state well as you know it's very large state um-hum cool and it certainly cost more in in some areas than it does in others exactly they uh and the they they call it the robin hood plan plan taking from the from the mostly prosperous urban district or suburb district and passing it alone to the rural districts so i don't know that that's going to be in the courts for a long time i would think so uh that sort of thing has been tried here and the results are results the results were not too hardening uh and the belief here is uh kind of education what do we need that for huh well that that's about the attitude here is just that you know if if you're paying for your local tax you're paying your local school district you can see some results of it but it's if you stop and think that some of that money is going to go get shipped off to South Texas or something yeah you it its almost like i don't know socialism or something isn't it exactly uh and i would think base upon my experience you have to have some of that uh consider uh some of these places in Idaho that have a school district of a total of about two hundred or three hundred children yeah and there a certain amount of overhead in running a school district uh for instance those kids may be spread out uh over an area where driving the buses you may go forty or fifty or even sixty miles and can you really expect the uh the people in that district to support all that overhead of getting the kids to and from school so some of the money come through the states from all people in the state basically equal well base upon their income to i'm sorry i i take i that back a little bit of it comes from their income uh to support doing thing like that and that's probably okay uh it's kind of like telephone where uh the folk that live in the middle of town subsidize for people that have lines that go out for four or five miles uh-huh uh the other thing that we have is a property tax and that tend to subsidies part of it also uh the disadvantage there of course the people get into is they say hey i don't have any kids in school i've been retried for thirty five years and i'm still paying for somebody education i know huh huh yeah i i guess i'm a believe in yes you have to you have to have some overhead just like uh i never used the fire department but at the some time i'll hate to have to ante up before they got here yes it's true that's true do you have income tax and yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay we don't have a state income tax yet well huh it's coming it's it's on its way i i'm almost certain yeah uh but that's why we have that eight and a quarter percent sales tax i i certainly that's true and and you know the the damage  what kind of air pollution do you think is the worst in Philadelphia i think the worst is cars cars because there isn't a lot of manufacturing right in Philadelphia any more at least not any heavy manufacturing yeah but they couldn't there is a lot of different pollution you can get from cars right right a lot of pollution from cars and also the trucks that drive around through so i think transportation is the worst right here in the city um-hum there is carbon monoxide carbon dioxide oh right uh-huh nitric oxide uh-huh the all that kind of stuff and plus we get the chlorofluorocarbons i guess from the old refrigerator and old cars yeah and there's ozone right it's like uh from also like when you fill-up your car with gas well you know in Philadelphia they've got these gas vapor recovery nozzle on all the gas tank now oh yeah that's right if you go to the gas pump you it just sucks it back out yeah um-hum yeah it makes it really hard to tell when your tank is full though uh because you can't really lessen very well hum you have to just trust the automatic shut off oh so you can't really get it full if you are going on a long its really hard huh well let's see what else there's uh more more sometimes they say it more pollution inside your house yeah from all the gas stoves and everything yeah well i got the dry cleaning uh-huh that stuff is pretty nasty nasty um i know all the kind of fumes you can get from bathroom cleaners your aerosols that's true though most help aid don't let me use bathroom cleaner with bad uh chemicals in them any more chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons chlorofluorocarbons or something like that chlorofluorocarbons that's it right they make me use Simple Green or um they will let me use Comet or self cleanser but what simple simple green is supposedly it not toxic really right it it suppose to be none toxics and its suppose to be good for the environment oh yeah yeah so they like that i prefer uh ammonia and um there's something my mamma gave me last time i was visiting her its a it's called scrub free it really makes a bad odor though so my housemate don't like that what is it scrub free scrub free huh right well you know i knew that the air in Philadelphia was not the greatest when i first came here it i lived where i could on a clear day see the Walt Whitman bridge but i couldn't see it for a a couple of months until it got to be winter time and the pollution cleared up oh really where are you originally from from South Carolina oh huh but the amazing thing i was out at San Francisco a few years ago and the air there is so clean well not always depends if you don't there if there's a brief stop then you get the uh smog right doesn't move like you're out in Lake Tahoe its like that you can really smell the gas fumes from cars the air is trap and it doesn't go anywhere uh-huh in fact the worst place is probably in Mexico Mexico City i heard is right on the top of the mountain yeah well they validated i think uh one or two hundred day uh days out of a year over three or four times the known you know the allowable limit right it crazy and uh some of the worst kind that our you can have also air pollution you can just have cigarette smoke stuck in oh cigarette smoke the worst place for air pollution of cigarette smoke is the laundry mat i hate that in a laundry mate right when people come in and they're smoking while they're waiting for their clothes and you take yours out and they're all clean and you want to hang them up and oh gosh there all these people smoking there um-hum really wow fortunately i've started going at an hour where not many people smoke hum but oh i really hated that when that was a problem for me i know which is worst cigar smoke or regular cigarette smoke uh boy um boy i'll chose regular cigarette smoke yeah hum but if there was as many people smoking cigars as there were cigarettes cigar smoke would definitely be worst uh i don't know its a lot of smoke out uh out her you can see um the New Jersey when you go by the refinery or even when you go across the Delaware River down by uh it passes away but down as you go down toward ninety five you see all that that stuff that comes out of the refineries oh right  okay uh well what do you think is there something wrong with public schools well i'm not so that i am not willing to send my kids to them oh is that right uh-huh yeah now that's partly because i want my children to have a religious education uh which a public school can not and should not uh-huh uh-huh offer uh but it's also because right you feel they get a better education i fill that they'll get a better education i fill that i have more control over uh the type of social pressure that they get expose to because i can choose um-hum you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that they're getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because it works both you know because not only am i doing this but presuming the other parents are doing the same thing right right they have the same motivation for sending their children their well i think there is a problem with with the public school education system and i yeah yeah i think it is demonstrating by the fact so many people uh graduating from high school and can't even uh perform some simple uh math problems and uh or or even read a a decent uh book uh or geography i mean some of them can't even identify the states United States or various places in the world so i think that we are sending uh some some children out into the world with a very poor education foundation and i think that the problem started when the National Education Association stop being for education and really became more of a labor union and only put their main entrance in teachers pay like education like money was the the solution to every thing yeah i think that the i think the answer is something what you are doing right now i think that a voucher system or some competition between schools to give uh parents a choice of where they send their children to schools and allowing yeah uh the school to compete with one another the become better i think that is the American way well i think i i think that that works too uh you know i i sometimes wonder there a a school system near me that they actually a fairly good one what they've done is they had one school that was because of the neighborhood the neighborhood school system basic the school system basically and they put their talented and gifted program in the poorest school district you know the or the poorest poorest elementary district that was part of this larger district uh-huh right and um they allowed any of those neighborhood children who wanted to stay there to stay and then they didn't it wasn't that they had the talented and gifted program just housed in this building um-hum all of the classes were based on talented and gifted and all the kids were treated the same way and as a result this is now the best school in the school district which is really kind of interesting that's uh-huh um-hum a magnetic school well it's essentially a magnetic school that's right but it's also a neighborhood school you know and the neighborhood there are some of the neighborhood kids who can't manage and the talented and gifted program because uh-huh and i think it's more case of you know there are some children in this world who i accuse of perhaps you know and and they just not only can not compete they simple didn't you know those kids really felt uncomfortable but the majority of kids if they're taught the way that they teach talented and gifted kids it turns out the majority of kids really are that way right um-hum you know each one a little bit different but each one has a lot to offer so that's a public school that works but then there are other public schools in that same district that really don't work um-hum and and unfortunately even that school although it seems to be working academically has some um some real race problems that uh which is real unfortunate because most of the kids who comes in are white and most of the kids who are there are black or uh-huh i think part of the problem with the education system really isn't the education system but it really has to do with the loss of the family structure in the United States and the loss values of uh you know the guidance that went along with the stable family structure isn't isn't there for all the kids like it use to be yeah yeah i think you right i think you right and i think that a caring teacher can do a lot to change that but then you are not talking about is it a public school is it a private school is it you talking about you know are you and the kids are going to be lucky enough to hit the teacher who can get home  well Jim sounds like you're starting out on something new uh so what kind of uh aspect do you have as for as budgeting well we're we're actually saving you know both for the wedding and for a house right now so it's kind of a double whammy uh where i i stood out uh i been few i uh bachelor for a long time so um-hum you know i was kind of living for the the day and what a debt so the last year or so i've been killing off a lot of debt and actually and uh in May when the stock plan i'm in comes due i'm going to wipe out the last of my debt i'm going to be totally out of debt in we have a nice uh start toward a house good um and we we come from a very different background where i came from a fairly affluent middle class family and my fiance came from a lower class uh save every penny you've got family so we've kind of i taught her to to let go a little bit more and she taught me to um-hum do budgeting and you know really evaluate what kind of stuff we're doing well that's good i guess our situation uh well we've been married twenty years and i guess our budgeting is it's actually minimum and we've gone through period where we've needed to budget on quite formally but uh we've gotten to where we structure a lot of our thing so that they uh use use a automatic debit with our banking account yeah i i use to do that but um i found that it it doesn't give you the flexibility floating something a couple of days when you need to right yeah i guess um you know the situation i'm in um my pay is given at a particular period of time and it never varies and you know so there's something that we've just found that it works best to deal with the you know the the regular fixed expenses uh yeah i i suppose when when you've got you you know a a when you got a good pad of of money where you know you don't have have when you're not you know you cash flow bound that's where to work at yeah um yeah um i guess um there really haven't been a lot of thing that we have picked on that have work for us other then you know the uh the automatic debits require require more discipline um it also simplifies in that doesn't require the discipline to say oh yes that is due on this date and then make the appropriate trip to the bank or whoever and uh so actually we live in uh in in Canada and so with our banking system being more national uh it does make uh funds transfer and that kind of thing a lot more yeah i've i've got i've got direct direct deposit i find what i helps a often lot is i have Quicken readily available on my PC and i've got for the next six to eight month all my pay checks all my fix expenses um-hum in there so i i can look at my cash flow and i can say you know i've got to pay these on these dates and i can structure these debt payment around here you know not debt payment in sense in the sense you know paying off against you know legal thing like you know paying credit cards off and things so that you know i can really map out and say on this date i'll have this cash flow and i'll have this net worth great and that help an often lot to look forward yeah oh i would think you know i would think it did um yeah i guess you know in the late of budgeting it's something that we always have been very week on and i guess for us the challenge is now that we've got a son fifteen and a daughter eighteen that we're trying to train right well i mean i mean i found it was for a long time you know i really was living for the moment and i i think that my um-hum i got such mixed message message from my folks about budgeting because i mean even to this day they their you know both of them are out of work now because of the one full economy in Massachusetts right they're both in social in uh you know uh human services um they got hit real good but you know they're still remodeling stuff and things right so you know in in the sense you know they they would criticize me for going out and and and spending money on on things to make myself happy but then they go and you know do do what to me are cosmetic improvement to the house to you know get the same kind of thing now that that more of a value added to there house then me going out and getting CD's or something yeah but you know it's the same kind of thing where they always thought i was getting mixed mixed message about that yeah and that's that becomes the biggest challenge you know if i think about it myself is the budgeting impact from a parenting role uh it take it takes so long for a person to develop that budgeting skill and there's i think it's going to become more critical because of were now  all right gun control means using two hands yeah uh well i fill like uh there should be some gun control but uh i don't fill like you know um uh just regular normal person that just using it for hunting and stuff shouldn't have to pay for other people mistakes oh i agree i mean i don't see any particular sporting purpose in anything that explodes when it arise yeah and i can't quite understand what i do you know what you a rational for a machine gun that's true but i mean to say that the quote assault rifle is you know a bad thing all that is is a change in a stock configuration yeah if you think about it um-hum well that's true because you know they been making semi automatic classically style if you will rifle for years yeah and the and the only thing between the assault rifle and that is a stock is a stock change yeah that's for sure what can i say right uh yeah and uh well the uh huh i'm trying to think what to say here oh okay yeah i just uh you know i just can't quite understand it's interesting is uh i get down to Texas quite a bit yeah and uh you know it's interesting how when you get away from you know north of the middle of Virginia yeah how altitude change yeah different different altitude different places you know it's it's just like well i'm originally from Wyoming so um-hum out there you always see guns because of ranchers and farmers use them all the time you know it well i'm from central Virginia and it's you know it's not uncommon at all to drive down the road and you know there's a you know the the shotgun is in the back of the pickup yeah you know and so it just you know what you get up here it gets really weird yeah it's well that's the way it is around here you know especially you know you get closer to uh bigger cities and stuff and it's right where where are you from in Dallas well i'm i mean from Texas i'm at Fort Worth which is right out right to the west of Dallas okay yeah i flown into Dallas Fort Worth a bit so yeah uh but you you know they they all have there problem down here too you know with guns gun control and stuff uh but it's you know it's it's significant i just detected a significantly different altitude like up here you would find it very difficult to go to like most of the sporting good stores up here hardly they may carry firearms but would have to hunt for them yeah and you go to Texas and that's just part of the store yeah oh i see what you are saying so yeah you know i mean you might go you would to you know go to a major chain like a KMart yeah is you will have a hard time up here in a KMart finding somebody to sell you a gun if they may have three or four of them on display yeah when you go to a KMart in Texas in you know that's a major section of the sporting good section that all the difference i'm saying oh well so when it they don't even totally different yeah so in in other words they they make you wait or you uh Virginia's by county is there's no wait for a long gun yeah there's in some county it's whatever the county wants statewide there's no wait yeah which is stupid because if i don't want to wait three days in the county that i live in i'll drive to the next county there isn't a wait yeah you know yeah i see what you are saying there you know i mean that you know it's uh in fact they got big trouble is Washington DC is got total band on firearms yeah you can't own one well yeah they've but they're killing each other by you know five and six a night in that city yeah because because they get them form the black market and stuff well but you understand what i'm saying is is their gun control is a hundred percent but it doesn't work so now they say well we got to you know they're saying Virginia and Maryland got to have gun control so they can't you can't buy gun gun in Virginia and Maryland and bring them to DC yeah but they're still going to have problems though no they just steal them yeah well they break into somebody house and just take their guns oh they don't break into to people houses they  hi what kind of pets do you have yes well let's see i've got a a a Great Dane actually use to raise Great Dane when i was in college uh in graduate school that interesting and uh sold them sold them for a pretty handsome profit about four hundred dollars a piece and uh help me pay my uh pay for my kids um-hum and uh i've got to uh Scottish Fold cat cats which are uh pretty unusual cats are they short hair or there median hair uh their like their hair length is like a tubby but uh and actually they're closer related to the American tubby um-hum okay but they have uh they call them folds because they have this genetic anomaly that make their ears fold over and so they look like they're they're snarling all the time and uh which is it's a pretty it's a pretty cute look you know on a cat uh that after after they you know when their little especially but uh you know now ours now ours is getting a little bigger bigger almost a year old so their their full grown cats at this point their almost yeah just the yeah just to basis and uh their extremely docile i mean their the most their their so calm actually one of them um it so calm we actually thought it had some brain damage or something you know because it just pretty much sleep like a dog all the time you know we did know we what was going on thought it should be you know running around you know scratching up furniture something but uh um does it seems to be okay though yeah the guy said it was fine and uh you know does the yeah yeah it was just it was good i mean the actually since i've got a i've got three little kids so they uh you know spend all there time playing with these things so i'm kind of glad that it's not a very active cat it's more of a uh you know it can take a lot of punishment and doesn't seem to get to excited about it so you also have less breakage right fewer thing get broken around the house yeah now do do you have animals to yeah um their's a couple of cats one of them is name Jimmy and he's he's uh mostly black but he has some orange and white uh-huh and uh he's about three three and a half year old now uh-huh he's sitting here looking at me and um the other one is Tiffany Tiffany is actually a male uh-huh but at the time that we got Tiffany we name him before we realize what his sex was uh-huh because he you really can't see to well what his you know pretty yep i mean it wasn't like very obvious and so we name him Tiffany because he seems like a pretty prissy little cat and we thought it was a she yeah yeah and uh anyway so Tiffany's name stuck even though his sex change look at look at Johnny Cash song yeah that's yes and uh then there's a dog name Taylor he's uh uh Doberman uh-huh and he's about ten months old now Tiffany and Taylor and Taylor are about are about the same age yeah we had a we had a red uh doberman uh a long time ago and we call we we named it uh Mistral as in as in the music you know like the Wondering Mistral yes but uh and not real realize because we were you know we just didn't realized what it was going to sound like you know when we went out the back door you know and scream you know Mistral Mistral wish i could have saw our neighbor like what the hell going on over there and we didn't realized for the longest time why everybody thought it was so funny until we finally picked up on it but anyway the it really was a good dog i was amazed at the uh the energy that doberman have i never realized it compared to Great Dane i mean Danes are like just really slow moving animals and uh Taylor is pretty quick he's real springing uh he just kind of like yeah just bong up in the air pounds along or something i don't know yeah he he he really um it's interesting to which him walk he's he loves everything i mean he he really would love to get closer to the cats but the cats think he's way to big uh-huh and uh you you know like oh my gosh uh-huh what's this big thing doing putting it's paws right next to my my head here it we had it when when we first got the uh the cat our Great Dane was standing in the living room and the cats you know literally were out the out the bag you know they just came out and their wondering around and one of them wonders in to the leg of the dog and it the the dog doesn't move you know and you can see the cat the cat kind of looks at it really think you know this must be a chair leg or something you know and it kind of if it looks up higher and higher until it looks up and then there this gigantic face you know right in front of the cats face it really it really freaked out the cat face it's like boom oh my gosh what was that exactly but that was that that was one of the funnier uh things that happen hey Sammy come over here and look at this thing yeah but uh their  okay so we are talking about recycling recycling yeah i i just move down from uh up near Boston oh you did yes and up there they're doing quite a bit uh-huh they they one of the thing that they've tried doing is they've had it they got a uh deposit on all uh plastic container you know bottle what not and you mean like bottles of what kind i mean like Coke bottles things like that uh and also cans so it's a five cent deposit on all of those uh which you know encourage some what for people to bring them back oh Coke bottle okay yeah oh that terrific there also in area up their that mandated uh separating your garbage yeah so you have to separate separate the glass from the plastic from the uh from the paper i believe even right from the paper oh that's really so i know that they're doing and up there and several community down here they're not doing a hole lot down here uh their actually are some community where they mandating that uh most i think it's aluminum from everything else yeah and also it's against the law anywhere in the county down here to uh deposit uh yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash yeah yeah so that's what they're doing here what are they doing there well i i'm very interested in this because i think it's it's extremely necessary and i i've tried to you know from the beginning i i started you know um trying to recycling even before they had any program you know they they just sort of had voluntary trash uh you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they it's they're trying to have um a city wide program where they're actually have special trucks to pick up your separated um plastic and glass and uh newspapers but it but it still voluntary but well they've they've got trucks for part of the city and and they haven't gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of Plano so some of the people in Plano do have that recycling and it's pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we don't so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know glass bin and the and the aluminum and and uh but there they don't take plastic what of the other thing that there was been done up in Massachusetts that was very good well several of the grocery store chain were uh instituting a five cent credit if you brought back your bags and reuse them oh that's great uh see we're we don't have that either yet either i'm trying you know i keep trying to remember to bring my little canvas bag into the store with me but i can't remember to do it it's real hard to break that habit sure you know just going into the grocery for five or six thing and then you get in there you think why i don't have the bag with me you know you haven't seen any i haven't seen any of that down here but we have you know a lot now i saw one lady not to long ago with five or six of those canvas bags and she had them all with her and she took her grocery home in those which i thought was great sure but nobody does that i mean it's you you just never see anybody with them right my parents uh live in Little Rock Arkansas so oh they did yeah that's not to yes well they do and they uh and i i sent my mom a couple of those canvas bags just so she can do that because they you know they look at her like she was crazy there oh they do okay yeah well good for you yeah yeah they they really we we need to encourage i mean i know in New Jersey where i'm from originally i'm from there and you know they've been doing um the glass you know the pickup of separating trash and mandatory for a long time they've they've been doing it for a year or two sure but um but Plano needs to get more of these trucks unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like Plano i where it is not densely populating uh you know the whole area yeah that it is a lot easier for people to uh you know ignore the landfill problem where as New Jersey Massachusetts you know New England oh yeah see they have to do it yeah New Jersey especially i mean that a really populated highly populated state i guess Massachusetts is to right Massachusetts is getting there well Boston is like Massachusetts is very heavily populated you know western Massachusetts is not is not is that where you're from originally is that where you were born no no actually not i was i was born in Alabama and i lived in Oklahoma where we didn't do any recycling i lived in Arkansas Massachusetts now Florida yeah yeah so you've been around so Massachusetts is probably like like i said the best of what i seen there well it's i just i just think the more you you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little or something big whatever you can do sure well there's there's actually some other good ideas that have come up where for example i think this was actually originated in Oklahoma city on the uh where they scrap the uh top of the roads off and they actually remixed that and use it again but you know for the asphalt they having to uh you know trash out oh yes oh that's a neat idea i never would have thought of that so why don't Oklahoma city thought of that well that's the that's the thing that there are thing you can do that you can't you know nobody thinks about sure there are these thing that people would get their minds working and just you know brainstorming that you just it's a whole new way of thinking sure i i believe in Baltimore they're recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt are they really well that's neat yes which they also think it is good because it make the roads prettier oh for heaven sakes that's right that's amazing because we use to live in Baltimore because they sparkle we lived there for a while before we came down and we lived in Pennsylvania and then we came here about fifteen years ago my sister is born in Baltimore she was where she was at what hospital born in Baltimore i i don't know  okay i guess we can just go ahead and start sure enough so what i did while they were uh a matter they i made some notes while they were calling around and they called quite a few different number before anybody answered ooh is uh some notes that i wrote down about our budget and that is uh the biggest problem that we have is that uh my wife and i both work and i get a fixed amount and i'm paid once every two weeks and my pay check always the same okay um-hum she also get paid once every two weeks but her pay checks don't come at the same time mine do okay and she doesn't get a fixed amount every everytime she gets paid oh geez and so trying to put together a budget from pay dates that are different and change all the time and where her amount change uh has been probably been one of the biggest budget problems that that we have wow and uh so what we've done is kind of taken everything that we have had to pay out over a an extended period of time and then tried to average it um-hum so that we could approximate how much each bill would be and then budget our pay checks accordingly base on the minimum amount that we would expect to receive okay and that's that's been fairly effective what happens if you get hit with some extraordinary expense hum you mean like recently right well i mean you know you know before you have a chance to say well geez we have a couple of months where we been low and put some off uh in the bank exactly and that's uh that recently happen we had to have break jobs on both of our cars and uh so then we end up doing a couple of things uh dipping into saving is one uh-huh ooh yeah and uh scrimping on other thing to uh get the extra money and then uh also we've got uh a an investment plan with a mutual fund um-hum um-hum and that's kind of like a savings account so between all of those varies sources and uh that is obviously not a very good way of doing thing sure so uh well i mean you don't want to do it that way you rather just keep it all in the in the bank but uh my gosh no i you know it's it's funny because when they came on they talked about no right a home budget and what not i stopped and thought to myself geez we don't have a or turns out that you know don't even have one uh my wife and i also work um-hum and uh she work for the federal government and i work almost for the federal government and but it's you know fixed income basically you know from pay check to pay check how much you're going to get yeah right um-hum and uh i'm the only guy that pays any bills um-hum i mean she carries the check book but when it comes time everybody who mails a bill like gas company and the telephone and all of that kind of stuff comes to the house and one of them gets plopped in to my mailbox and then once a week or once every two weeks i'll sit down and and write checks uh-huh hum well just recently we've we've found out that um we've had her money direct deposited to one account and my money direct deposited to another account a different account huh um-hum correct and we've been trying to live off my money which is not working out right so you can the her money and then save it or right exactly we've been trying to well basically we wanted to use her money just to pay the mortgage on the house um-hum you know that was that way we wouldn't have to worry about the mortgage it would be covered and then we would have our living expenses on mine uh-hum and it just hasn't work out you know and it i i've read these budget book and they say well you know you sit down and you figure out how much it's costing you to live and all that kind of stuff but right um-hum uh what i've notice is that it's extremely difficult for us to come up with a right uh it usually it it well cost it cost us you know uh five hundred dollars a month to live it doesn't work that one month it's five hundred the next month it's a valuable uh budget yeah um-hum right um-hum it's a thousand because you get the car insurance bill and then and then it goes down to two hundred because uh you're off on vacation or something or you know you you went traveling and and you didn't spend as much but then you come back and it goes up again and i mean it's uh that's been my problem um-hum hum we've got bill for example like the uh car insurance you mentioned that come and and this is the other problem when it comes to budgeting is that we have bills that don't come on a uh monthly or or once every two week bases like we get paid the the car insurance comes every three months right so that means that uh uh everytime because we haven't uh disciplined ourselves where we can have a uh certain amount set aside each month for when that bill comes we end up paying that whole bill every every three or four month and then that cuts into everything else on it um yeah well i do have to say that uh when you know when we were real serious about budgeting the money and doing all of this my uh sister sent me a book and it was the book uh Wealth Without Risk by Charles Given um-hum and i do have to admit he had one suggestion in there that really  so i think the matrix system would be a wonderful thing for the United States and for um United States being able to trade more easy with other people in the world as the world economy become much more global just having a standard system of measurement especially one that easy to calculate where G not become one and all kinds of nice stuff like that is just a wonderful advantage yeah i i agree with you there the metric system is very good i'm um i'm um do drafting i'm i'm a engineer and i've done drawing and and have to do calculation of fluid mechanics and thing oh right yeah so you get and if you ever have to try to do four different conversions to to to try and all four different type of system with gravitational constant that's exactly right and it it just goes it just goes on and on another thing thing is that when doing your drawing you can scale them so much easier thing because their increment of ten's so much easier i remember right i mean your your life is just uh so much easier i i really think that what can be done differently is that it's it's to ingrain in our society to shift it all our prototype all our our mode our template our bolts our threads everything that's right the tools are that's the expensive thing the tooling the tooling is is so is so uh in in our system that it just it it just going to take a lot to move it away that right if you think that every garage corner garage has to buy a whole new set of tools well most of them have the matrix set now but it's it's it's uh i think it's more in the the the the bolts and threads and stuff it self i mean the the screw machine and stuff that makes all those thing they're just they cost millions of you know thousand hundred of thousand's of dollars and thing and that's and i guess maybe they could be resented some of them could be resented but the company the business community just doesn't want to do that i think what really needs to be done is that they need to be educated that in the long run their life is going to be so much easier right but not only will their life would be easier easier they'll be able to make more money selling things abroad oh exactly also the trade you're you're exactly right yeah it's uh we need to do that and uh as i said the the main thing you know like just in the calculation the the i know i most calculation i remember when i took fluid mechanics and i the professor was telling us how he wanted us to give the answer and i was he said he wanted them the answer in the English system because the engineers needed to know how to use the English system exactly i i treat to give my answer in toundar in what toundar which is a um toundar T O U N D A R oh okay i know what that is yeah so he he didn't like that very much yeah it's it's you know and then that each individual company has their own set of guidelines they they they use but we our our society in the United State in the global in in the world and the economic seem that nobody really wants to be compatible with everybody else we started out with the computers and we've we've had to fight tooth and nail just to get them to be some what compatible and they're all just going off and all different all these different directions right right and i guess one of the problem is is that the goal isn't to produce produce produce the technology the goal is to produce the buck the the all mighty dollar is so powerful that it just it it just control our destiny well there's always the conflict between innovation and standardization and they're it's always going to be true that the most advantage advance thing and the thing that has the highest performance for any given application are going to be non standard um-hum but for the general everyday things that have been worked out the standardization is such an advantage so and something like what side of the road you drive on um-hum i guess there was a time when that had to be worked out and before very many people were driving it wasn't a problem um-hum um-hum yeah well i guess so you just yeah i guess that's that's true i really like first thought i can't really think of what the different would be the different has to do with uh  okay uh what's done in your area well in our area we uh had basically a road side pick-up for uh aluminum cans plastic um that's about it if you want to participate with paper um wood and other products alone that line uh different types of plastic you have to bring physically down to the dump uh different types of plastic other than food types container plastic right um what about glass um glass actually that's handle on the road side too so along along with the paper or or or the plastic and the along with no glass and the aluminum together yeah okay that's that's the way we do it here uh we have the addition thing of uh newspaper pickup but it doesn't include uh magazines or telephone books or just plain regular paper like computer print out just only for news print only what about cardboard that's not included that's that's completely different uh i feel you know it's kind of ridiculous you know you're only allowed to pick-up one sort of paper when you have something such as phone books which contributes a lot to uh waste paper they should pick that up as well what do you think about the value of of magazines as you mentioned yes that that would be good if they can if they would pick it up i i i put them in too because so much of the uh junk mail that you get is made of the same type of uh print uh wax print uh that's makes it hard to recycle well in our town we've imposed um basically a sign that forces people to recycle you have to pay for all your trash all your trash bags um-hum there's no more municipal trash pick-up i see and that intricate people encourages them to uh reduce there waste um and that actually had a pretty good result so for so do you feel people are uh hoarding their garbage no there um a lot of them are recycling by trying to compress their trash into the bags as much as they can uh-huh um but for the most part it it's been a big boost to the recycling effort i see it was uh much contested because no one likes to have to pay a dollar fifty a bag rather steep i guess it it is very steep but it really forces you to think about what you're throwing out um-hum hum well what what we have you just instituted here was a um uh biodegradable type pick-up uh once a week they'll come by and out of a container that you've mark only for biodegradable plant clippings lawn clippings uh it has to be decomposable matter no uh dirt uh no bricks or anything like that uh they'll pick that up once a week and we are not allowed to put that in normal trash hum well that makes good sense what did he do turn into compose or that's right yeah they turn it to compose and where they put that i have the foggiest idea because i don't see at along side the road uh it got to be this big huge pile somewhere in the city hum yeah we don't have anything like that around here or at least that i am aware of or they just but that does sound like it could be beneficial especially in the fall when you've got about twenty bags of leaves out on the side of the road yes um what what do you fill would be a good idea to encourage more recycling um in our area as as as i mention earlier if you force people to pay for their trash they're going think twice about what they're throwing out um-hum they're going to look at everything closely i know i go out of my way to recycle what ever i can um part of it is because my environmental belief but the main part is uh you know avoid paying more than they have to pay and uh i think if more people are force to make that type of decision you know as far as the pocket book they're going to recycle uh-huh what about the idea of um that some state have about force deposit on say beverage containers you think that's a good idea no i think that people uh that that that hurts people economically and i don't think that really benefits the overall recycling effort um because i know a lot of people just throw out there cans anyway regards weather it's a nickle a dime for a bottle um-hum um and i'm just not a big believer in that type of text which is how i view it i say um that interesting because i i i personally like the idea uh if i had uh five hundred cans saved up between soda and other beverages uh uh what i think you run into a problem there is then you have to bring the cans down to a department a a pick-up center well if they did like what they did when i was younger were all soda bottles were returnable for the most part um every store had where you turned in the bottles and the manufacture  so what kind of pets do you have at home at home i have a wide variety we have a lab back home and we also have some horses and we we have one calf but it not really a pet it just it's just it's a means of food yeah yeah but horses and my dogs are my pets uh-huh i i was raise on a little ranch so i've been raised around horses and dogs my whole life where is home Arizona oh okay we use to have two dogs we had a um uh peekaboo you know the mixed pekinese and poodle and then we had a uh Airedale terrier yeah yeah i know what they are oh really yeah and the Airedale was fantastic she was great real trained and protective and um she was interesting yeah when i was but yeah go head when i was growing up i had a German shepherd that was everybody my mom brought the dog for herself but the dog didn't like anybody except me um and i was the only child so me and that dog were just like best friends and unfortunately we had to put here out because she got to old but i did want any dogs after that and then when i got married yes i know a chicken that's my young that's my older son but um i just dogs and horses are the only kind of pets i really enjoy yeah um i got the the Airedale or my husband for a Christmas present and the peekaboo was mine for my girls and me i guess and um you know we don't have any now i just got to where um i couldn't afford to feed them you know and um that have to be groom both dogs had to be groomed cause of there hair and yeah that gets very expensive very expensive to groom oh i know that feeling oh and it just i have to do that with the cocker cause i use to have a cocker to and uh-huh it just didn't fit into the budget it would fit into my mines right now either with two kids it's like uh-huh no that what i have i have two girls and it just oh really i have two boys yeah didn't um didn't fit but we enjoyed them when we had them you know yeah planning you know we got the Lab when it was a puppy for our boys was fun uh-huh and my my oldest son just insisted he had to have a puppy so we got him a Lab because that's a good children dog uh-huh and my friend down the road back home in Arizona breeds cocker spaniels uh-huh and she said as soon as i got back home i could have my pick oh okay i'm waiting to get my cocker from her that would be good now we got the peekaboo as a puppy but the Airedale was was pretty much grown yeah she was a couple years old and um she had been trained and everything before we got her is she papered huh does she have her papers yeah but she um she was from a really good family to of of dog you know if that you know whatever you want to call it but yeah um the only thing was one she was she was use to being on a ranch a big wide open and then i brought her to our our duplex and we had a fence in back yard oh and so the only problem with her was when you open the gate she was gone yeah and this dog if the said sit she'll sit you said lay she she'll lay you tell her go get in your pin she'll go get in her pin and she wouldn't come out but if you got her out behind the fence or behind the house inside the house she would not come when you call her it would just be she's gone she's gone and she's gone that's it she open up she open the gate by herself you know she would take her nose and flip it open and get out really not very many learned how to do that she was very smart i know my shepherd did and it it just really floored me when it it happen uh-huh because i went out there to feed here one mourning and she was just gone she was just gone and i was like Reba Reba where in the heck are you i was about to die i thought my goodness we've only had this dog one day two days and she's already gone and i spent all day looking for her i thought somebody stole Reba at first because she was a black and silver shepherd and they are really hard to come by they are and she was you know she had her papers and everything and i thought somebody stole her at first uh-huh and then i she came wondering back later that day with a rabbit in her mouth and just went right back into her pin oh my goodness and i went out there the next mourning to feed her and i put her food in there and i walked out the gate and pretty soon i heard the gate slick open and she comes walking out behind me i was like um well that isn't going to work no they used Molly um this is a dog that um John my husband aunt had brought and that's how i had got her i couldn't have afforded to buy her i mean they are expensive yeah and um so  okay okay okay okay i'm uh well i do work for a large company uh large meaning about twelve twelve thousand people that's big and uh it use to be twice as big could've been uh could've been better i'll put it this way when i came to work here it was twenty five thousand and now it's twelve thousand and dropping uh-huh but uh the advantages of a how how big is the company you work for uh less then a hundred people okay less then a hundred some of the same thing still applies i've work for company's uh your size before and some of the same thing still applies though uh one of the things is like i know a guy that gone to work for his self and and uh after a while he became isolated uh-huh yeah he was he craved uh yeah interaction yeah and uh that's one of the nice thing a about a company uh interaction with other people access to internet uh do you have internet how did you get hook up to this uh well i have an internet uh through another i have another internet connection through another network but we're in the process of establishing our own internet feed internet feed um so thing like that the internet uh access internet access to a library yeah um gee how do i say it uh well i think the diversity of a large company is a strong thing for it um the the fact that there are so many different ways that uh working for a company could take you a a large company um granted if your skill your skill were like nuclear physics so you pretty much narrow to to uh your choices are narrowed but i can see someone with on doing what i do going into many different sort of venue i guess you'd call them in a larger company um i'm a system engineer and i basically design networks um uh-huh so for our end user and our customer i'm you know uh i'm pretty much limited to that that's what that's what i do the one of the advantage of uh of a uh larger company and the hundred is uh could be consider a larger company is is access to other people that do the same thing um-hum if you're the only computer programmer in your company then it's it's it is kind of isolated and uh so that one of the advantages of there's a lot of disadvantage of course but uh yeah i think one of the disadvantages is the bureaucracy that props up as a you know necessity for almost anything getting anything done at all you have to uh many layers to go through yes and one other thing that that uh tends to happen in in a larger company is uh oh how do i say it uh lack of access to uh to people they they tend to departmentalize and and uh move away where as in a company your size uh let see a hundred or so it i in the pass had access to people who had access to just anything anything anything and everything was uh was available uh-huh where as in a company like this it's very fragmented and i'm i might be um-hum and you have the typical pyramid structure of organization many work group one man on top or woman um and middle management and the whole nine yards right yeah and so well i can be ten feet away from somebody that is doing the same thing uh-huh we are structure in the uh in uh in uh bubble uh structure we are many different work group however we work together um that's by design we've had the same structure for basically for twenty years and uh it allows us to do many interesting thing we have many facet to our organization uh and we are able to mix and match and bring different facet into play as they're need so we we basically cover the whole spectrum of computing uh for our for our customers and uh i i have one fear here i i don't know if i push the one button long enough i think you did do you think you can hear that huh okay because i yeah i haven't they haven't said that we're out of space yet maybe they deleted their temp directory well in the past they've it they seem to shut us off fairly quickly so i i was wondering about that let me try it once more here yeah well um you know we can talk as long as we like or until they tell us i've usually hit the marker to um we are not suppose to be talking about this anyway uh so we're we're in a we're in a bubble diagram and uh okay that's that's a really effective and i think that is a very nineties kind of thing like i say we've had it for twenty something years and so we are really good at it but uh  so do you do any kind of regular exercise uh what i do most regular is swim lap swimming uh and um of course i've been indoors a lot lately we've been having some really cold weather here but i prefer swimming outdoor uh-huh um for the i think i find the our door atmosphere more inspiring for my exercise really uh-huh a little less claustrophobic yeah yeah and um i just thought i always fill a little more lively um i think when i the times when i do uh-huh or wouldn't having to pass on to the gym maybe to work with weight the weight machine um uh-huh it just a little more spacious yeah like you said claustrophobic uh-huh what do you do for exercise well very little lately what i do i walk about a mile to the bus well that a mile a good way each way in the morning yeah and and then then a mile back well that's good two miles a day is nothing to at it's it's a lot better then nothing i think oh yeah i've just recently um something i tried to incorporate into life style just recently is walking when i'm going short distances like when i'm at work if i'm going to go to a restraint for lunch just choosing one close enough to walk uh-huh yeah that's nice i think it really clears your head a little bit yeah and i think one of the um probably i i think that one of the most important thing about enjoying your exercise and getting it regularly just to have it in your life style like and not be like uh-huh six o'clock at night and well now i've got to go well that's one that's one reason i actually do the walking where i tried other thing is it has a point to it oh yeah it's really is part of what i need to do anyway you know i need to get to the bus yeah and it's finite too you know you eventually reach the bus you don't reach your two miles and say well i really should walk that extra mile it's find i right right right it's something i had to do where when i tried you know running around the track i felt just a little pointless yeah and it was very easy to avoid yeah um very easy and i'm i'm trying to do some um some you know calisthenic type thing at home oh are you really but it's very easy to avoid yeah um one calisthenic type thing that i i feel like i i feel like i have gotten to do and eventually with out having to think about it do is just squatting down when i going to pick something up instead of bending over at the waist uh ooh and um i can i think i fill like i can already tell the difference in my thighs just i have a little more definition that's very interesting something probably better for you anyway yeah and i yeah and that what that what started it with a little bit of back trouble i was having and of course i didn't want to do leg lift or anything yes right are those are then of the painful and sort of artificial category that's right that's right well i was just i one of the issues i want to do is try to avoid some back pain or try to i mean i have it every once and a while and i know when i do this exercise i don't get it which is it call it crunches yeah oh yeah we kind of do a sit-ups yes together i'm just going to ignore that call waiting if you heard it yeah okay um yeah where you sort of try to put ribcage into your pelvis and do it over and over again that would defiantly fall in the unnatural category yes it does it does and i always find a good reason not to do it um yeah but i can tell that i haven't done it no this girlfriend of mines got a pretty flat stomach not i don't really but i don't i was asking her because she does not she's one of those who just doesn't exercise you know uh-huh and um but she said she you know just you know hold her stomach in all day i mean you know just constantly holds it in all day oh yes i trying to decided if that was good or not good well i'm sure it would be good for your back it seems like it might impede impede you know impede your breathing a little bit in less really use to it uh-huh um what do you think yeah i i mean i found myself doing it i mean i sort of been in that habit through out my life and lately it's uh lately it's not oh really hasn't been happen quit as much yeah i i was in it for a while um when i was in high school i took um choral and you have to hold your you know just to regulate your breathing you had uh-huh you don't stand very carefully yeah but i found like the top half of my stomach above above my belly button was getting you know was always tone but then the the trouble spot below the belly button never never quit tone you know and you know that was the part i was concern about so i just blew it all off all together uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah um and what else lately along with the crunches i was trying to do some push-ups oh really uh well my wife is we're expecting a baby in May oh and i know that from the last time what she really like is to have a lot of very hard back rubs during the whole thing and i'm just not ready for it uh-huh and i thought well if i can do a bunch of push-up then i should be able to get through these this time but uh i have the problem now where we have a son who is almost three and he think that it is great fun to try to climb on my back while i'm doing the push-up so well that could you know slow you down a little bit it's just that extra resistance and it's slows me down a little it makes each one a little more meaningful but i can't quit do any um do you do any exercises for your hand the little muscle in your hand um no what what what are you thinking  hi um i'm Ralph um Cincinnati Cincinnati hi Ralph um uh the the machine said that the topic was uh taxes yeah um weather we pay too much or uh maybe we got back what we uh because we got i guess to die for what we paid okay well i'm i'm ready anytime that you want to start okay um let's see i guess we got one oh okay um oh yeah go head well let's see i guess uh since i'm in the process of filling them out i guess i kind of fill like uh um it's it is too much but i don't know what i uh cut out i guess no i i know what you mean we're in the process of doing ours and it it it does seems like a lot uh i wish i had a better feeling for uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here it it it's hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is is like Monopoly money it it's so larger you don't really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car you get a better feeling for for what's going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands um-hum but uh i Americans in general well i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually don't mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i don't believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system um-hum but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that after a while it becomes to easy and and and people uh say well oh sure well we we haven't plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need that's okay we will just let it go and and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars and hum so there there's no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset hum that's interesting but uh i guess that's uh something that happen when there is so many people involved each one fill like they take a responsibility for um making sure that thing work the way there suppose to or something but um i never really thought of it that way but huh i guess there seems like their some programs that are more valuable and other that be that be useful to have more uh sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but but what sort of involvement uh would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that um i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one solutions where they actually maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where i'm from but it's i think it's rare to actually no like you can influence what uh your representative is really doing because if you know if even if there's even a lot of writing campaign chances are there'll be a lot of letters on both sides of the issue particularly if if it is a controversial bill or something like that huh yeah well here it here in Massachusetts i mean we have a just like the rest of the country we have a a server budget problem and and often here uh people are are angry about their taxes being so high and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state um-hum and many people fall back on well there's money there's a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well it's all out there somewhere um-hum and the the next step is to identify where  uh in Pittsburgh we have just recently in about like last year uh in the fall they started uh a blue bag and and blue container uh sort of program where you know is that the same for you yeah um well we just have to have put it out in a separate container is is that a curbside pickup then yeah it's curbside and also uh we have a dumpster in the apartment building where i live and there's a blue dumpster too um-hum yeah when you go to the supermarket they give you uh plastic blue plastic bags oh okay but i don't think it works out so well where i live uh i'm in in the university area uh well because the blue dumpster gets full uh with other things as well so i know that the they reject the uh recyclables when they're mixed with other trash so it probably doesn't work out too well yeah as as as as a matter well it's a matter of people starting to respect it and understanding what it's for and understanding that it actually does help everybody if they all recycle yeah but it but also uh it this seems kind of it's kind of bad but i think it needs to be more convenient to recycle i mean that that almost seems like it's it's as recycle as convenient as it could be yeah but the problem is that you have the garbage dump right there and then you have the recycling dumpster bin right next to it yeah you just you just need to uh keep a separate container in the apartment or whatever and separate there yeah but it is pretty nice though that the supermarket i'm not sure whether i mentioned this uh they give you the the the blue plastic bags uh along when you when you buy your groceries and you just use those to recycle um-hum so is is that mixed all recyclables do you or is it only uh cans and bottles and stuff well right now and i was just going to go look for the little pamphlet i have about that uh but it's um bottles and cans and they've just added paper to it but what i'm not sure is whether or not you can put them all in the same bag i usually separate them oh okay yeah New New Jersey has since New Jersey has had a major waste problem for a couple of years now um right now at least in the town i'm in they collect all recyclables paper you know newspaper and junk mail in one bag and then mix together cans bottles and that's both aluminum and bimetal cans as well as uh plastics like your soda bottles laundry detergent bottles that type of thing right i'm not sure and you just put it put it all together into one bin it's nice and convenient yeah i think i think uh i think you can put them all in into the same bin i'm like i like i said i have been separating them just because i'm not sure uh but i'm i know that the one restriction they have is that uh you're you're not supposed to you you well obviously you have to clean out anything that had food in it or you know whatever you're not supposed to put things that could have been contaminated right do do you have to soak off all the labels too uh no i don't soak off the labels because that that would be a pretty big pain i i i'm like i i'm not quite sure about the exact policy uh because i thought i had uh something laying around uh that specified what the policy was but i could never find it yeah so i i mean i'm sure i'm sure that it doesn't take that much to to remove the the labels it's at least doing something um but i know i mean if if i did there all the rest of the people in the apartment building that i that i i live in probably wouldn't because because there's just just a matter of education it's it's just not there yeah well it it it's that and also in the apartment building you don't have the fear of being caught oh that's true yeah oh in New Jersey they will or they at least they can i i haven't really heard of anyone doing this if you put recyclables in with your regular trash they can refuse to pick up your trash right well that's but whereas if you're living in an apartment building there's no way of tracing back who put in what right well what they do uh i i i don't know anyone that uh has has had had this happen to them because no one that i know has a home in the recycling areas yet but uh if you walk along after garbage pickup day uh some people will have their bags still sitting out there with a little note on it yeah which i've never read one but i'm assuming is probably telling them telling them why they couldn't pickup that particular uh bag but yeah they they'll do they'll do that here too if uh you put out let's say your glass and cans in a paper bag they'll put a big orange sticker on it saying put it out in a plastic bag or a separate container um-hum you know what though i bet if they they could certainly just stick the the rental company with with the uh with the bill or or whatever and they just give the rental have the rental company have more responsibility because they're really yeah in that respect they're the only people who could have any you know any control over over it over over educating their tenants or you know yeah the the the problem with that is it's such a long way it doesn't ever get back to the tenants that this is something you really need to do because even if they do a slight rent increase it's so small and over such a long period of time that no one notices yeah yeah the the only other way to uh make it a little more um useful for people to do is what they had down in Atlanta  hey um generally i am majority majority majority of the news that i get is from uh AM radio in the mornings but going to and from work i we have like uh a a WCBS station which which just kind of fires through all the top topics um-hum how do you uh how do you generally find out what's going on in the world oh i don't know oh i listen in the car but my commute is only only a mile so uh but uh you know i have the uh radio wake me up in the morning so i get i get some headlines there oh okay i read the usenet news okay uh really i'm not getting the good quality news that i want and i i bought a TV last year but but i don't really watch it you're behind yeah oh and i don't i don't believe i don't get any in depth stuff i used to have uh i used to have cable and uh the thing that i really miss um since uh since i lost cable and there's that not that much on there that i miss but uh Headline News was always good because i could get a quick roundup of whatever the top topics were in in like a half hour span and in Around the World in Thirty Minutes i think was their big thing and the other thing i used to i uh i miss is CNN um CNN used to go a little bit more in depth um you would get uh like Crossfire you would get you know different different perspectives from usually from like the left and the right liberal and conservative arguing the various uh oh Crossfire yeah i saw that a couple of times i think Patrick Buchanan who's now running for president used to be the uh conservative side for that who did they have i've my friends who watch CNN all the time they like knew these guys i can't think of the name of the guy that represented the left yeah uh i saw the uh McLaughlin had a similar type of a program on yeah i guess Buchanan retired from that also um-hum that that's a good show i like that one a lot yeah that's actually on a network isn't it yeah it's on i guess it was on PBS for a while that's exactly right probably still is and and uh see because i've run into that a couple of times on accident and uh ended up watching it for like extended periods of time but that's how i get most of my news is is yeah yeah PBS PBS PBS uh you know MacNeil Lehrer or uh NPR usually have some decent in depth stuff i tried listening to NPR but uh uh i mean in the mornings i don't in the mornings i want i want a little i want you know the the yeah the USA Today feed you know give me a couple of color graphs and uh and i'll be happy headlines oh God i hate that yeah we have uh you know the local newspaper is is pretty weak uh um-hum but uh and i once in a every once in a while like every six months or every three months i read the Times um-hum the Times is pretty good the only thing that scares me about um the way i do news is getting it from like these pre digested sources you know like the like the typically what i've heard maybe it's just the people i hang around with but typically i hear people saying that like uh the news on TV and what not tends to be um more on the left hand side it tends to be a little bit more liberal and if nothing else it does tend to be more editorialized than these are the facts well not only that but it's so little there's no background true too uh you know i rely a lot to tell you the truth on uh you know when i was growing up i learned geography i'd read the Times a lot so you know and every every day there'd be an article on some country you know what's doing in that country this week um-hum you know because there's enough countries that uh you know there'd be something interesting happening pretty much and i got a pretty good feel for you know and um that and taking some economics classes you get a pretty good feel for how the world works um-hum so when you hear a story then you say well what aren't they telling you yeah and then you start conjecturing and that's where i hate i hate it because you know i can guess what's happening but i don't know the real truth and uh they just they leave out so much but see i think you and i perhaps i i think uh well i get the feeling that that you and i perhaps might might take the time to try and figure out exactly what really happened as opposed to what they're telling us even though they maybe close yeah but i wonder how much of the rest of America takes the time to to stop with just the the straight spoon fed you know huh you can stop wondering they don't care yeah yeah well especially when you figure what a third of the people that bother to vote always vote Republican a third of the people that always that bother to vote always vote Democrat and  okay well are you still there yeah i'm here yeah uh we got real good benefits where i'm at although they're becoming uh less and less every year so that they're taking a little bit more away uh especially when it comes to health care benefits do you guys uh have full coverage where you're at yeah well we do um it's it's funny that uh that you mention that because health care benefits are really a big issue nowadays because of the skyrocketing costs in general yeah our benefits uh we we have a choice between an HMOs between various HMOs or just straight uh straight off major medical Blue Cross Blue Shield and um seems like the main idea of insurance companies is to try as hard as possible to deny benefits and collect uh premiums as much as possible yeah yeah i i i agree uh you you pay a lot of money into them and then when you finally do have a claim they uh they really stick it to you they say that it doesn't meet their uh they're you know their their minimum amounts or something like that they've always got these uh these plans set up where they they've got a certain amount benchmarked for like a certain operation or something but when you go to that doctor it's always like ten or fifteen dollars more than what they'll pay for yeah and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh the the primary or the the customary fee should be fifty dollars but then the most of the doctors around here charge seventy five so it doesn't really keep up with what they actually have so it's kind of a they they kind of take from you a little bit there and uh the uh yeah absolutely other thing about Pratt's benefits uh when i first came here five years ago they really had like the best i thought that i'd ever had and since then you know they've the staggering skyrocketing uh medical costs like you've said uh they've really had to cut back on what they give people because it was just taking too much money out of the company yeah it's expensive uh it's very expensive for the company to uh to pay all the benefits out uh if you want to talk for a second about non health benefits uh at my office we have free drinks free beverages wow and uh that's really popular that's very uh a lot of people like that where we have uh all kinds of uh uh well here we call it pop i guess on the east coast you'd call it soda and uh juices and oh you have soda oh coffee and tea and uh uh spring water hot and cold and soups and that's well that's pretty good benefit then yeah it's very nice uh often if you're just having trouble thinking and doing your work you can just get up and walk to the kitchen and uh make yourself a cup of tea a fresh cup of tea herbal tea or whatever and yeah well i didn't i guess i never really thought about that as a benefit we we can get up and go to our cafeteria and you know and pay to get something to drink but i guess i guess that is kind of a benefit just to have a place to go do that yeah oh definitely it gives you a chance yeah we we have a real nice cafeteria we can go to that anytime during the day and it's always it is always nice to go down there and get a coffee or a tea or a juice sure absolutely and get your and give your mind a rest yeah that that's that's always good uh do you guys have like a savings plan uh well the company offers a 401K but they don't contribute at all uh our uh we we're really lucky in that respect our for every dollar we put in Pratt Whitney'll match us sixty cents so so that is great that that that that's real good and that's that's one reason why i why i really like that yeah that that that is a very nice benefit one of the things that we have lacking is the number of vacation days we have uh only two weeks vacation a year does it depend on how many years you've been there no it's just across the board wow that's really something uh at Pratt it's uh if you're there eight years or less it's two weeks and as soon as you get your eight year in you get three weeks and then when you get uh fifteen years you get another week so you know a guy who's been out been out there for like twenty five thirty years get about uh you know five weeks vacation paid a year yeah well in the technology industry it's such a young industry that there aren't very many people that have been in it for a very long time so they don't have the same uh oh okay scale although at other jobs i've had i've i've had three weeks vacation ah so uh so stripping down to two was uh how are your how how how important is that you know your benefits when you sound like you've uh done some job hopping you've had more than one job then uh three i've had three oh okay with that how many how much time did you spend with each one very short oh okay the first the first job with the first two were a year and a half each okay and uh and after that i worked for two years wow at the company i'm at where i plan to stay for a while okay and and that's up in in Pittsburgh you said that's right okay that's right but you know in the the computer the computer industry is a little bit more liberal with benefits in general hm i think than other industries um in terms of uh flex hours and just the you know the whole attitude of the work place ah that's another that's another benefit i forgot to mention we have flex time yeah you also have that that's right that's one of my favorite benefits uh ever since i've been ever since i graduated from school in eighty six every job i've had has always  so so what uh how do you feel about capital punishment uh tough question i mean it it's i was actually kind of thinking about it the other day someone was talking about it how uh a person who takes someone else's life he was saying should should not deserve the right to have to keep their own life it's kind of it's it's it's a really you know it's a moral dilemma i don't know um huh i think that i i forget what the law is in my state i mean my home state i'm from i'm from Maryland yeah i have no idea what the law is anywhere i've ever lived i just and i just i don't know so i i personally uh even though i understand the principle behind capital punishment i don't agree with it ever applying applying capital punishment to anyone um because i sort of believe that if we've got a person arrested that sure we can uh we can say you know it's a murderer he's done heinous crimes but we can keep him in jail for the rest of his life and not give him a terribly pleasant existence and uh there's just no reason to justify killing a person and you know there may be an economic reason but i don't think that's sufficient to justify uh killing someone if you believe that killing is wrong you you might as well apply that to you know even that stays stays true even if you're punishing someone i know that's how i feel yeah i mean it kind of seems going back to uh eye for an eye hand for a hand kind of thing maybe yeah i don't know it's like uh you kind of wonder do you want someone like Jeffrey Dahmer alive or not oh or or Charles Manson well it's just that i feel like they don't really pose a threat if they're imprisoned you know sufficiently and yeah you know i i i guess it would be bad if the politics ever changes and they got out for some reason but i don't see it happening uh yeah like i don't see Charles Manson i think he'll never get out he's he's probably going to be up for parole in a year or so but he's not going to it's not going to happen oh yeah but the thing is you know when these guys get out it can be so quiet you may not notice i mean if the public doesn't hear about it for some reason i mean the thing is Charles Manson was really publicly well know but if it's somebody who's you know a serial killer but he never was really in the media a lot then when he gets out he still won't be in the media this could be yeah so i you know uh it could be bad if somebody got out i guess yeah i i still i think even if they aren't in the media i don't know if it would happen unless maybe it was uh bureaucracy that got pushed aside and someone said ah we'll let them out uh-huh i don't know someone i don't know i mean i guess there's are probably are small time serial killers that you don't hear about uh-huh something um well there have to be because uh uh i don't know there's like well i don't know the numbers but i mean there's at least dozens of capital punishments every year from what i that's what i think it is and you know you don't hear about all of those i don't know um because i think i don't think they actually execute prisoners very too often because there's i mean there's death row there's a lot of time where uh prisoners are kept on death row for a long time i mean yeah there was uh Ted Bundy uh-huh there was uh i mean there was such an outcry to um to execute him because it i mean he was the the crimes he did were just so heinous um now i i think that there's it's just such a controversial thing that it doesn't happen too often i'm not so i i don't at least at least i don't hear about it that often right yeah i don't i don't know either so um nah i don't think there's been an execution in my state in a long time that i know of right yeah and i know that like um uh one of the one of the things that that's that's one of the things that the that Amnesty International is against in the United States is capital punishment yeah they're against capital punishment oh okay of any of any kind so that's the one the one thing they have against the United States one of their gripes well aren't do a lot of countries countries not have capital punishment uh i don't know there might be some that don't that'd be interesting to find out who doesn't yeah yeah tough to uh to um what's word i'm looking for uh to justify right i guess i kind of waver i guess sometimes it's like someone like Jeffrey Dahmer you kind of want  okay do have a dog or a cat or uh i got both both yep what kind of dog it's uh half Border Collie and half Lab is it a house dog half Border Collie no i mean is it a house dog mean do you keep it in the house yeah yep it's and it's uh and you'd think he's an uh little poodle a little poodle he's about eighty pounds though really yeah well i've just the opposite i've got a Pomeranian he probably weighs about five he thinks he's a little man yeah he's a little he presses around and struts but i don't have a cat though that might be a little bit too much do you keep the dog and the cat both in the house yep yeah they get along yeah oh yeah they get along real good oh the dog was brought up with cats so he doesn't really bother the cats well that's good well now the little kitten picks on him all the time oh really yep well how old is the dog uh let's see uh about seven eight years old goodness mine's only i guess three and and our cat's only about two years old well um what made you get a dog and a cat well uh we both we've had cats and dogs before you know before we even got married so i kind of like cats and she likes dogs so yep so you compromised so we've had them oh at one time we had two dogs and two cats goodness but well i got my dog little dog to keep me company and now i'm hardly ever at home so now it's like whenever you come in he's all over you oh yeah well ours does that the company when we get it oh really yep yeah it's like a new face yep uh something i guess like just something new and different oh yeah he he's pretty he's real friendly well that's good but but when somebody knocks at the door he's his barks is real uh you know like he's a real bad dog but uh when you come in the house and he he'd probably show the burglars where everything was at thinks i think that Brian would probably do the same thing oh well i've heard that um pets are like to to people that are sick or to older people that they're have like calming effects on them yeah i've heard that too especially i guess if they have like high blood pressure or um like heart conditions it just kind of helps to have a little or a dog or a cat or something around just to lavish the attention on it kind of calms them um-hum yeah i know i think it helps them too when they take them out for walks and stuff especially dogs you know plus they're uh the dog's a good yeah good uh way to protect your house too when you're gone uh that's true you know like i said he barks a lot when somebody rings knocks on the door or rings the doorbell so it kind of keeps people away yeah they think twice about breaking in um trying there's something i was going to tell you and i forgot just totally went out the window uh but our little our little kitty he she uses uh she's pretty cute little the wife got her when she she was a stray and uh it bit her and so she had to bring it home with her to see if she got rabies or anything and then y'all decided to keep it yep so isn't that funny how there's always a story behind something oh yeah well that's basically how she got the dog too oh well do you have names that are appropriate with more or less how you found them or how you got them or anything or well well not really no we uh the dog's name is Morgan and the cat's name is Oscar Anne Oscar Anne well that's a new one yeah well well see at first they thought that the cat was a a boy so they called her Oscar until the found out she was a girl so they just called her Oscar Anne oh i see so that's uh that's the name there and uh how we got the dogs was we were stationed in England and she went to some we had a dog and she took it to dog obedience school um-hum and this farmer was gonna kill these six puppies they had and she kind of said well i'll kind of i'll take one of them off your hands and that's how we got Morgan Lord did you have a problem naming um coming up with names for them i think uh well i didn't really come up with the name she did so it took me like three weeks to name mine because i kept saying well i wan t to find a name that fits uh-huh and i actually had for a couple of days had started calling  kind of dream car do you want to buy oh gee do i want to buy i don't know that i really want a whole lot more other other than what i got i just uh got a car about uh fourteen fifteen fifteen months ago now uh-huh uh i bought a Taurus um the thing i want always wanted a car with a big trunk so i can carry a lot of stuff that's one of the prime considerations i want something that's reasonably reliable and something that's not likely to get expensively damaged in a small crash and you can't get all three today you got got to give up one or the other hm that's interesting yeah uh reliability and an economy you know if you drive a lot but um-hum yeah the the fuel economy is not a big factor uh especially with the way that gasoline prices now are below what they were in nineteen eighty of course they were pretty outrageous then but but in real dollars yeah yeah in in real dollars it's just not not much of a factor um you know the uh what your ma call its it does it's it's less than insurance i think for example yeah that's true but i think that's really artificial you know that's unfortunate it's unfortunate it's it should probably uh taxed or something to well i don't that's that would be that would be reasonable i think i'm i'm wondering about the economic justification for taxing gasoline some more you say well it's a a nonrenewable resource uh limit that but i don't know there's lots of nonrenewable nonrenewable resources that one could tax just because they're nonrenewable including everything you mine out of the ground um i don't know if if there really is that justification but uh it certainly is is more more palatable to have them tax gasoline and use it to build roads than it is to have them take take tolls which means you got to stop and means that huh but uh getting back to the topic i guess i guess kind of pushed i guess i kind of pushed us off to the side supposed to be talking about cars not excuse me yeah but there's nobody that checks you see we could actually talk about anything but um if you i mean bring us bring us back to the topic if you'd like yeah well um i don't know uh you know i guess the uh i was like interested in like the uh the new Honda VX um-hum has the uh lean burn and all that stuff supposed to be very fuel efficient so it gives you about the same kind of horsepower um-hum and uh boosts your uh mileage by like uh almost ten twenty miles per gallon hm so what would you get uh you know what what are the what are the EPA fuel economy numbers almost in the fifties hm yeah that's that's pretty good now i don't know how big the car is i mean does it have a big trunk that's sort of the bottom line well you can you know like a well Civic is is like a Corolla or something it it's yeah that's no good it's it's not as well hey it's in some ways it's not quite as big as a Taurus but then it's not too much smaller either um yeah but someday and and you know if you have kids then you're gonna want to have passengers room for passengers and and uh no dreams for a sports car of any kind no i just i'm i just um um well you you can't drive it any faster than the other cars anyway it's not allowed you know but yeah yeah and and most sports cars don't have room for anything in them that's not my kind of vehicle so you'd rather have a one of those big vans well i maybe i don't know about a van the thing i i hate when i hate it when i'm behind vans but being in one would be the opposite effect you could see over everything that would be helpful uh-huh um so many times you get behind somebody and you wonder what's up ahead and if that person stops then you might have a hard time stopping so you or you or you just can't see around it like somebody could come in from an intersection you couldn't see it because the van blocks your field of view but uh what do you have a station wagon or a regular no i got a regular car but you know four four door sedan uh-huh do you have those uh split seats that fold down yep um-hum from the uh the trunk that's a good innovation oh no no not the one for the trunk i didn't get that one that would have been good but uh then you could put a lot more in i could oh yeah you could do that right uh i thought i thought it was that but it just doesn't work i mean there just is it would it would be it would be it would be nice if i could do that i agree huh is that well well let's let's put it this way the user manual doesn't say anything about it now i don't know it's maybe it's an undocumented that's interesting are you one to read manuals before using something this one is so much longer than any other one that i that i that i ever saw that that i didn't even think about writing it now reading now when i was a little kid and my parents got new cars then i would always read the manual oh yeah i guess so hey it's a it's a substitute for something wanting to drive but yeah yeah once i learned to drive hm that story was different yeah oh i don't know i i i i don't know i like um i i like those  you have any children yes i have three oh okay any college age uh no well um the youngest just finished medical school oh okay so you actually are probably pretty uh and so i feel like i'm kind of home free now uh great i'm on the uh the other end of the spectrum actually i'm uh uh four years into a doctoral program and i am working on my dissertation right now oh well i envy you i wish i had the courage to go back and do that it but i have afraid i have trouble remembering my own name now much less trying to do a dissertation oh yeah well it it it's a rough road as i'm sure your son probably can can attest to as well yes but it's it's very worthwhile when you're finished yeah yeah that's that's true well what did you look for when you were getting ready to go to a college to a university well to be honest with you i'm not i'm not sure that my my feelings back then are valid or are to be modeled because i was so young um i guess i guess if i had to look at it again i would probably want want to pick a school that uh number one had a good financial aid department uh the school i've been at does not i mean yeah it's okay but um-hum it's not great well they they tend to lose things oh well that's wonderful news yeah uh they lost my transcripts about four times and oh that's painful yeah that's real frustrating um that's that's one aspect of it i think something that's really important is for the school to have a good library yes oh i think that is of the utmost importance yeah uh my son chose to go to A&M here he uh graduated valedictorian of his high school class so he had you know quite a choice but he wanted a good what he considered one of the best science departments um-hum great sure and he wanted to practice in Texas so he chose A&M and uh they were kind of pioneers yeah uh-huh in their science department in that you could choose the whichever professor you felt was the would be the most enlightening for what particular field you were going into true um-hum and they listed them in a pamphlet that you received so uh so you actually got some kind of feel for what the faculty yes so that you could now you didn't have to report to i mean you didn't have just one professor professor that you had to be with if you were in engineering department you might want to go to Professor Smith histories were right um-hum and if you were going to be a doctor an MD you might want to go to Professor Jones and then um right and amongst all those listings they had also classified which what doctors were the better ones um-hum for each particular segment of that field like one might be better in organic chemistry and one might be better in electrical engineering so uh sure right sounds similar to what most schools do in in on a graduate level um-hum um where as it sounds like A&M does it more or does it also on an undergraduate level yes and they uh several of the other universities were using them as a model and going to try it because they felt that so students too often said well the reason i didn't do well on that test is my professor's harder so basically they all gave the same test right and you could uh you were assigned to a particular place and time to take your test but that was the only time um-hum now of course that's what i i marvel at some of these youngsters that i see talk about going off to college that have no self-discipline that yeah you know they're never gonna make it exactly because no matter where you go you there isn't going to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know yeah that's that's another thing i wanted to emphasize is that if and if and when i ever get to the point to where i'm looking for schools uh i think i'm gonna opt for a larger one um-hum just because i i think it forces people forces students to be a little more independent i know that i myself went to two schools as an undergrad one was small one was not small and i really think i learned more at the one that was not small because so much of the things i had to do on my own and i learned a little bit more about the system in general and more about myself um being able to handle the situations that i came into i would think that would be true you would also you know be totally on your own where you if you need help you're going to be the one to search it out right um-hum it isn't gonna just be sitting there and life is something that you have to search out everything you're going to do exactly it's it's an active state it's not something that you can kind of you know be passively involved in and expect to do any good really i don't think no i don't think so either now of course uh yeah uh i like i came from the midwest so i'm very partial um-hum  well Lynn what do you think should elderly be cared for in the home or do you think they're always better off in a nursing home or are there any answers to something like that well there certainly are times when uh it's necessary i believe to place someone in a nursing home um that uh person just becomes too expensive and too um hard on the family to care for somebody within their home but uh i think everything possible should be done to uh keep someone at home before that happens yeah well my my mother who's seventy is has living with her my eighty nine year old grandmother oh my and oh they're doing fine so far oh thank goodness but uh does your mother have any help it no no and and my grandmother's pretty self-sufficient uh she did have a mini stroke recently which is left her just a tiny bit addled but i don't think she's any place close to needing a nursing home no i i think it's only when a person becomes uh my father had to be placed eventually in a nursing home he had uh Alzheimer's disease oh how sad yeah it's um and it was just impossible to care for him uh twenty four hours a day um yeah but uh and there weren't enough um resources i think in the community to help uh my mother care for him um-hum which was really unfortunate yes i think it it it the placement could have been delayed had there been um more resources in their community that must have been very difficult for her to make that decision oh it it was and uh i think she she was there every every day uh at noon and at night to make sure that he was fed and cared for in a proper way and it was exhausting i think one of the the toughest parts about the decision would be finding the home uh i know in Texas we hear so many of so many abuses in nursing homes that it's just i don't know where you'd start he well i think you know the first thing is just to look at lots of them and then it it does make a difference if there are regular visits by family um that uh the staff you know is aware that they can't be neglecting somebody if the family's there everyday yeah um and i i must say i have some sympathy for the nursing home staff itself they you they are overworked oh yes and probably underpaid in a lot of cases i mean i think that's treated as pretty much unskilled labor uh certainly yes it's doesn't have um uh it's not compensated adequately and the um and there's certainly no prestige attached to uh um you know it's sort of a yeah it's it's it's a sad situation yeah i wonder if the church run nursing homes in general are better than the others i think any uh nonprofit facility is probably better run than uh those institutions that are strictly for profit uh so that means often that they are church run yeah but um my late in-laws lived at Leisure World uh for a number of years but i actually they moved away from there with a daughter before they needed the final care i guess it had graduated levels of care or something in that facility i don't know if you're familiar with that or not it's in Southern California oh yeah actually i um my my work is to advise families in finding care for their elders and sometimes that means getting in all kinds of community resources to the home whether it's Meals-on-Wheels or uh home help aids or whatever but when somebody is looking for care i recommend that they look for something that's uh has more than one level um-hum that it's not just an independent living facility  well um do you have any pets i have a dog who is given me a lot of trouble right now oh really and an aquarium of fish yes it's my dog's playtime in the evening and she thinks i'm neglecting her right now oh oh right at this moment yes now what kind of dog do you have i have a Bichon Frise oh she's a little bit oh good she's playing with the ball she's a little bitty white dog i think i can picture that those are the little long haired right right fluffy kind of dogs fluffy kind they sort of look like poodles but they're not yeah they have hair down in their eyes sort of yeah yeah they do and you have to cut it and get it out and yeah okay i picture them with bows in their hair well he has my dog doesn't like bows for some reason well i don't blame him i have a dog um she's a a stray and um or was one and she's i think a mixture between a fox terrier and something else she's about eight pounds she's real little oh she's uh yeah she's even smaller than Lacey Lacey is about twelve pounds yeah oh okay yeah well she's really cute and sweet um but speaking of pets um my brother just got a little Labrador puppy that oh yeah and i'm living with my brother and and uh that's been interesting i'll bet having having having your dog and the puppy yeah i'll bet that's cute it is uh they've there's learning how to play finely and and my dog's establishing her territory because she was there first you know um-hum oh yeah but he's so big even as a puppy that um he gets pretty rough when playing and then she lets him know that's not good no that's not good well my my little dog has a playmate from uh down the street and we have play appointments and play days where yeah uh um-hum oh huh that's cute where the two dogs trade houses and play and romp just to keep each other company well that's neat yeah this one the her playmate's a little um uh poodle a little miniature poodle they're about the same size and they're both white but the little miniature poodle is is skinny where my dog is fat and fluffy yeah uh-huh that's good yeah more more roly-poly well that's neat that you do that yeah we think it's kind of fun it's better than watching TV to watch the little dogs play huh oh definitely and it's better for them too emotionally oh yeah yeah well i had that yeah aquarium first and i got to where i wanted uh take my fish out and hold them and pet them that wasn't going to work so i had to get something that i could hold and pet yeah right yeah that's a good idea i have a bird too yeah so oh you do yeah but i don't take her out she's kind of ornery oh but i like to hear the you know noises she makes i have a parakeet oh a parakeet does she talk to you yeah she doesn't uh talk verbally um she doesn't she doesn't know how to use words but i really like the sounds she makes the chirping and all that she sings and all that stuff uh-huh oh yeah does she imitate the mocking birds yet no i don't think she's heard a mocking bird oh that's the most fun when they hear the mocking birds and then then begin to try to imitate the mocking birds and the mocking bird is imitating something else oh oh well i don't i don't even know if she's heard one i know i put her outside when the days are nice uh-huh um but i don't think we've i've heard of a mocking bird around my house oh or i leave the radio on for her sometimes when i'm i go i go to school all day so sometimes i just leave it on so she can have some kind of stimulation yeah you know i used to do that for my dog too to give her some stimulation but she didn't seem to appreciate it she kind of likes the quiet um-hum yeah yeah i i don't know if if and the dogs are real sensitive with their ears um-hum and yeah that that would make sense that it might be comforting but well i thought it would i thought it would be and i thought i was being a very good dog mother to uh to do that for her but she didn't seem to appreciate it she likes the the quiet i don't know oh yeah the quiet yeah she also likes being able to hear everything that's going on in the neighborhood and i think the radio masked that oh yeah that's true that my dog too she has to be near the window and look out yeah right and look out so she can know what's going on and i had all these delusions about how my dog was not going to go in certain rooms of the house oh yeah that's a delusion that's right it's just like you know i surely did i surely did well what did you name your dog so you learn quick yeah Kitty Kitty yes because she acts like a cat oh how so yeah well she's a real lap dog she likes to curl up in your lap uh-huh and she'll um she she just you know when she she's real dainty and she likes to jump oh  well um do you ever watch Wall Street Week no i don't watch that one um i get a lot of my news from uh odd sources if it isn't uh public radio or the local listener supported station i get a lot of it off of the uh the nets Usenet BBS networks and uh monthly and weekly magazines and newsletters what kind of magazines you ever heard of a magazine called Mondo 2000 no fairly obscure it's published out of Berkeley it's a futurist magazine apparently i heard about it later the guy started it as a on inheritance money he just wanted to have a magazine of his own and he wanted to be future oriented so it's really fringe science um new chemicals brain enhancement technologies virtual reality all that stuff that we're just starting to hear about this whole magazine covers it and then from that i can follow up on other sources and a lot of the stuff in there turns up on bulletin boards as people talk about it well i mean do you think that magazine is credible or uh depends on what it's about and who's writing a lot of this stuff is just reporting somebody may be developing some new technology and they'll be talking about the plans for the use of it it's not the kind of thing that would be really talent you know it's not something that's questionable like political opinions it's sort of a state of technology and what are we going to do with this and what do you suppose would happen if the government got ahold of it and you know that kind of thing oh okay and then uh you know the the the best source of news the comic strips not really wait so so you're you're a a firm follower of Doonesbury or oh yeah absolutely and Bloom County now Out Land and all the rest of them but yeah Doonesbury is great i mean sometimes he that doesn't even try to be funny he just puts stuff in that strip that we're not going to see anywhere else and uh uh like when he was quoting an entire week from Bush's speeches and the guy was completely incoherent i think that's when it finally they had to issue a press release that Bush was under the effect of this weird drug that uh has been banned in some European countries and that it was affecting his speech of uh yeah that's the one oh but um anyway well um go back to so you well do you ever watch any network news or anything like that at at 60 Minutes 60 Minutes i always watch 60 Minutes yeah i watch 60 Minutes and i watch 20/20 sometimes yeah i used to watch them but then i caught them in a bald face lie and i had didn't really care anymore what lie did you catch them in it was a long time ago they just did a hatchet job on ultra light aircraft and i used to fly one so i knew what i was talking about and they really i mean it was a classic case of what the conservatives accuse the liberal press of doing you know they fabricating uh making making one picking an item out of context and blowing it up i mean it was just such a classic oh really 20/20 did that yeah they did that it who damn themselves oh that's so that's so funny because um Friday night on 20/20 they had Jane Polly talking about how she had been exploited by the tabloids and what a travesty it was that the press would fabricate stories yeah really and then there they are doing it too so you just have to watch you know you have to assume that with every story you're watching or everything you're reading what what special interest could they possibly have that they would make them slanted this particular way so um-hum if you assume they're biased and then look for some opposite biases you get a fairly good idea of what's going on i know and it's like especially like if with the network news they always comment about everything and their comments are always biased um-hum you know just like all the presidential um campaign things that have been going on um-hum if you can just you get a different slant if you just listen to the comments and a lot of times they don't even show you all of what happened oh yeah so sound bytes all they'd rather do is give you a little sound bytes they do it's it's so funny they talk about the liberal press but most most every well virtually every TV station and almost every newspaper in the country is owned by conservative well off white businessmen and they have to be conservative because they have this multimillion dollar investment to protect and they're beholding to their advertisers they have to be conservative but the writers a reporter i mean if you're going to be in the business of reporting if you're a journalist uh you get cynical and uh cynicism can sometimes be confused with liberalism  okay well um let's see i understand you have more aggressive laws both in uh Washington and in Oregon than than we down here in Dallas well um yeah possibly um i'm not familiar with the laws in Texas but we've got a citywide recycling program here in Seattle that's um uh well well it's it's it's really amazing how many what's that is it mandatory is it mandatory um well they give you really good incentives uh they pick up the recycled goods they give you they drop off containers at your house so it's like it's like garbage collection um and you don't pay for it uh-huh and uh you same uh basically at the same time they jack the garbage rates way up and and made it so you had to have city provided garbage cans that were of uniform size uh-huh so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was uh you know something that i always put off because you had to haul the stuff and and so i you know we didn't do it much but i was amazed at how much we reduced the uh the volume the uh the volume of our trash well Ted down here we've had the uh containers available in you know various public places now since the mid seventies but just in the last few days there's been a proposal now to have uh i believe it's about six times four to six times a month they'll have a curb pick-up they'll give you containers that are color coded so you can put cans and glass and yeah it's like what we have yeah but the difference is we have to pay for that oh really about three dollars and um twenty cents or so or something like that i i was about half asleep when they were talking about it on the news but um it is not going to go over too well as long as you have to pay a premium to participate i don't believe yeah unless they structure the garbage rates so that uh you know it like works out to be cheaper well the garbage rates here are high however as long as you bag it in plastic bags you can put out up to ten or twelve bags of of trash oh my yeah they stopped that here they used to have it so that like you could get two can service and you could have huge cans you know that you furnished yourself uh-huh and then you could put a bag out with each can and in fact if you put out more than that they'd pick it up anyway and now they've really tightened up course there's some down sides to this too um there's i don't i i don't know i hear that there's more of a problem with illegal dumping after this when it you know after the rates went up i suspect we're having some of that here too and yeah and then uh the other thing is what do they do with all the stuff they're just they're going to recycle they now have this huge glut of paper um and it's difficult to find markets for it so the as a result the um price of recycled paper has gone way down because you know there isn't there isn't enough demand for it all yes well we've had some what the same problem here i think newsprint's down something like um under a dollar now per hundred weight oh my and it used to be two and three and i think it even got above three at one point yeah remember when the boy scouts used to do paper drives and make money yes yes there used to be a recycling center where you'd take things in and you know they'd weigh it and pay you and they had paper and of course aluminum cans which are still very viable here yeah and they had uh clear glass and colored glass but i noticed recently that place has closed up now my daughter's really active active in some of this and she there's a place oh about eight or nine miles well i guess it's about six miles from here where you can go and uh few things they pay you for most things they just take yeah but um the movement here has not really progressed there's Texas is always slow on a lot of these things yeah i understand until recently you could actually have an open container in your in your pick-up as you go down the road there um yeah that was kind of disastrous of course we've had um major problems with them driving while intoxicated and all that i think they're finally starting to get things a little a little more squared away but they're a long way from that yet uh Texas has always had a tradition of uh people staying away from i mean laws the laws really leaving you alone unless you were clearly doing something right uh it's it's out of the old west you know like you know yes just recently there there now uh well up until recently you could have a a rifle behind the seat of your pickup and all that kind of stuff and now they're starting to discourage you from that um yeah and in there's parts of town here now where  kinds of music are you into uh well i i like lots of different kinds of music yeah same here uh my uh my uh upbringing was in classical music but um i really enjoy um uh-huh all all different kinds of music for example i i really get a kick out of Rush and uh and Pink Floyd uh-huh they just played here in Atlanta not too long ago oh yeah uh-huh they played uh with uh Primus have you heard of them um no i don't think so yeah i didn't i didn't get to go to it then i know some people that did and they they said it was a really great show yeah yeah i'm sure it was um i also like jazz uh-huh what kind like modern or and um well yeah well yeah i like Fusion but i also like uh the classics yeah i'm kind of i'm more into the the traditional like um Flonies Smunk and uh Cole Don Cole Train maybe uh i like Winten Mersalis yeah he's great yeah he is he's very good he was i think he's i read in the paper i was thinking about going down to the Jazz festival in New Orleans it's like a i think might be the end of April but um i think he's supposed to be playing there he played in he played in town in here in Atlanta a little while ago too but i didn't have the money it was like eighteen bucks or something yeah now i saw him along time ago before he had achieved fame at the uh Jazz Festival they had in Cleveland oh really oh really God that must've been great yeah he he is really good um i i i even enjoy uh some of the old timers like even uh uh from like the big band era like Bennie Goodman or uh-huh uh i saw him play uh when i was a kid also uh of course he by that time he was he was an old man but it was still fun to uh fun to listen too him uh-huh yeah that'd been weird seems like a that seems like a long time ago i'm i'm kind of i don't know i'm into a lot of different kinds of music too i like that kind that kind of jazz and um a lot of different kinds of rock music not really pop type music you know like radio a lot of radio play like the stuff i listen to but it's not you know strictly alternative either right it's kind of i like um let's see there's some local bands from Atlanta like have you ever heard of uh Fuller for Now they're they're real new yeah they've they've they've gotten in Rolling Stone a couple times but uh they just put an album out um the Red Hot Chili Peppers uh Fishbone they've got they've got some horns i i like i like bands with horns yeah that rock with horns it sounds really neat yeah i did too i i i one of the things given given my classical background uh one of the things that really turns me on is uh when the musicians are are creative with their instrumentation uh-huh yeah um as well as you know the typical creative lyrics or or or melodies i also like that's one of the reasons for example that i like Rush is because it's not always right you know in two or in four even meter you know it they they they mix it up they they do interesting things with rhythms and they do interesting things with right um-hum yeah their drummer's unbelievable yeah and also um Getty Lee on the base yeah uh-huh um it's not just a straight base line that just repeats over and over and over again like on the pop tunes it right it it it it it changes up yeah definitely do you play any instruments um yeah i play i play uh uh oboe and English horn in fact um i've actually started playing again oh really uh i played when i was uh up through college in my first year of college and uh uh then college got the best of me and then i got married and had kids and and i really haven't had very much time to play but uh i have i found a friend who uh-huh uh-huh i met somebody in town who had kids became friendly with and discovered that we both played oboe in college so we've been trying to uh get together once a month or once every couple of weeks and well that's good and and play a little bit mostly uh it's mostly remedial work for us because we we we're both out of shape uh-huh yeah i bet i i'd never played really anything throughout school i never i don't know i never got in it i thought it would take too much time and all that then i i um i started getting into uh drums i got this bongo that someone had left at our house and i sort of play on that and i got i got a drum set like three months ago oh cool and i've we've got extra room in our house and i've been driving all my roommates crazy playing on that but i really need to get like i know this guy that i think i'm going to try to get to uh give me lessons and stuff because there's lots of stuff that i don't i mean i could i'm improving but slowly and i think i could you know yeah well also if you if you take lessons you might be able to uh learn a lot nip bad habits before they start yeah it's true which i probably already have because i've been playing for three months but um it's never too late i guess it's not too late to change yet but uh it's been that's been a lot of fun and it makes me listen more a lot more too to when i'm listening to bands and music and stuff uh i mean i i play a lot more attention to what they're doing and i i appreciate you know a a lot of what the musicians are doing  so i get most of my news i i am sorry to say from CNN Headline News so i'm not sure how remarkably well informed i am by their like three second sound bytes about everything but uh i'm a college student at this point and uh when i come in when i turn that on for half an hour i see what's going on and then i turn it off and so how do you get your news uh to tell you the truth i get most of my stuff uh news from printed media um news magazines like Time uh newspapers hm i'll watch television at in the evening for local news but uh you know for national things i i tend to go more for printed media uh media because they they don't give you the three sound bytes the three seconds uh gee he looks good in a in a camera you know uh although i have to admit i'm dissatisfied with the right quality that you get in the newspapers it's unfortunate but which newspapers in particular like USA Today that's been well uh well let's see uh no no actually we're LA Times we also get the New York Times out here um oh um-hum and then of course there are lots of specialized publications for you know i work in engineering so you get engineering uh stuff uh what i found is that uh right uh you know you are subjected to censorship uh even though that's a bad word uh what happens is an editor has to decide what will fit in the newspaper and what gets dropped on the floor and that's censorship um-hum well that i think that comes about from the fact that that the the news gathering business is is just that a business that's right so they're going to tell you what sells and also although i don't believe this is really that rampant at now uh you know sponsors or or advertisers could have some influence as well over over what uh eventually gets printed i uh i i agree with that i've seen that in several uh computer magazines where you know if the guy buys six pages of of color ads then he gets a pretty good review in when they review products yeah and also i think you'll also notice if you ever do watch CNN Headline News that anytime Ted Turner does anything he shows up on there uh gets a favorable light cast on it yeah you you know what though uh i kind of wish that i would uh watch more local news because i end up uh sometimes missing things and hearing them secondhand just because i never do sit down to watch the real news well you know there's a big problem with the the local news is something we've noticed i mean out here in LA we get gang shootings you know yeah and so what you can do is you turn on the local news and if it's a bad weekend the first fifteen minutes on a on a Sunday night or a Monday night will be how many people got shot and killed i think that's the way it usually is they they work from the you know the headline stories you know those ones basically people being killed and murdered and and suffering then they go into like right you know sports and weather then they end up on the really nice stuff so that you're not depressed by the time you're done watching the broadcast right a lot of a lot of times though there there isn't the really nice stuff oh really oh yeah the uh in in at least the the news stations that we watch here in LA and i mean you know it's it's uh uh maybe it's just because they're stuck with more bad news than good news um it's a possiblity uh but uh you know it's it's it's unfortunate but even even now i mean i used to live in Europe and we still get uh we lived in Germany and so we still get some German language magazines some where in Europe um-hum i get the okay we get um-hum and uh the thing is that you know that of course is slanted right from a German point of view and uh you know what you notice are the glaring differences between how America perceives some monumentous event in the world versus how the Germans perceive that same event right and i mean it's uh you know the the difficulty is that okay they're it's a business over there like it is here they're slanting it toward their uh public and we're slanting it toward our public and you know the question is what's the real truth um-hum well i think that's uh it's kind of related to like who writes history because obviously the the news eventually does become history it's just always going to be someone's the prevailing opinion yeah well unless you have a particularly strong the winners disparity and there are two you know two competing views exist well it's also again um you know the the uh the the people who write the history it's their view and from wherever they happen to be i mean what we've noticed is that um um-hum uh the the way the uh the Americans are handling Russia the Germans view that as a critical new market and the Americans are well you know the right apart from McDonald's well yeah yeah and the uh the thing is that the Americans are well we don't really don't want to get involved with that we don't want to help them they've got to learn to help themselves you know free market economy right  so uh what type of music do you like to listen to oh i listen to all kinds really um uh heavy metal and funk and punk rock and all kinds of goofy stuff uh-huh well here's what do you listen to well you know i uh i don't listen as much as i used to because uh hm because i used to drive to work and that's always good radio time but now i walk um-hum um-hum oh do you what well i walk and i take the bus do you really wow so i don't get as much radio time and uh we have a small son and it seems like everytime i put on something i want to listen to he starts wanting one of his tapes um-hum um-hum uh you know and uh you know i don't want to discourage him from listening to what he wants to listen to so i put it on and i figure i can listen in a couple years um-hum uh-huh uh but i like i like listening to jazz although i'm kind of ignorant about it and uh i like listening to classical although i'm kind of ignorant about it um-hum yeah so um-hum and i sort been listening to sort of like sort of an old foggy station here that uh has a lot of rock from the uh um-hum you know sixties and seventies uh-huh and uh i i'm sort embarrassed to say i've been listening to that uh but i'm very you know i you know i've gotten it's i i it's funny how you get older and you don't know what's going on in popular music at all like who are some of the heavy metal um-hum people you like to listen to um let's see i don't know i listen to i i don't listen to that as much as i used to i uh but i used to like Megadeth a lot and Slayer um-hum uh-huh and um some of the some of the heavy metal bands are sort of making it into um into the pop scene i guess Metallica and bands like Nirvana and stuff i don't know if you've heard now some of these have been a long around for quite awhile haven't they uh-huh oh Metallica's been around for ages how many years do you think um let's see their first album was out in i'm not sure eighty two or eighty three uh-huh yeah that's quite awhile yeah that's it and Iron Maiden uh i was really into Iron Maiden when i was in middle school and stuff that was uh-huh they started up in the seventies yeah i mean these guys it's so it's funny how pop stars get old uh-huh uh but still manage to sort of sing about the same things yeah um so do you play at all yourself uh actually actually i play uh i play the flute i i was in uh band all through high school and i still pick it up uh i don't play with any organized group now but uh i play still play every now and then uh-huh uh-huh what kind of pieces do you play um my favorite ones to play are uh stuff like Mozart i love Mozart and uh uh-huh um just general classical stuff Bach and Brahms uh-huh how long have you been out of high school i've been out of high school for two years now uh-huh um yeah i used i used to play uh in the percussion section in the high school band and uh oh really yeah i enjoyed that but it's not something that you can do so easily by yourself you know sit around with a snare drum and you get kind of bored um um-hum and i played piano in the jazz ensemble oh that's neat and that i still keep up with a little bit but yeah you know i'm still i'm doing what kind of sounds similar to what you'r e doing i i have pieces i could play in high school and i still play them um-hum um-hum and i i i really like to move on to something else but uh i haven't been putting the time into it so sort of marking time at the same place yeah oh um-hum uh now when i was in high school though we we knew about one funk band that we were excited about that's probably who was that you know ancient history by this time uh uh oh God course the name just uh the name just slipped my mind but it's the Peace of Parliament hm is that like that's not doesn't even exist anymore does it i'm not sure Parliament and they had a thing the peace funk was their big thing huh i don't know i've never heard of them okay who do you listen to oh um in funk i don't know if you would i don't know if most most anybody would call it funk but uh bands like Primus and Fishbone and things like that okay you know i've heard of them but i've never heard their music really i really like um Primus a lot Primus is a good group uh are the radio stations near you that play this sort of thing no not really um uh-huh i i i think i think that Primus gets a little air time on like MTV and stuff but i don't think i i don't think i've ever heard one of their songs on the radio Fishbone either uh-huh so you have to get the albums uh-huh right right yeah um now what about punk does punk still exist  all right uh what did you look for when you were looking for child care well we uh we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to uh to getting you know because uh usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed so that that was a consideration um uh my wife and her mother went over to the uh to the lady's lady's house who keeps uh Helen and uh they you know before uh took her over uh actually took her over but before we signed up for it and uh just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we uh we went with her and we've been we've been really happy with her i guess that's an important uh uh uh i haven't thought about that as much as i it uh when we did it we we didn't really have child care we had uh like uh day school uh-huh yeah so they're kids before they went to school and well what what we had done was talk to the parents and of the kids that were there and uh all the parents were very enthusiastic so we thought well that's a that's a good point and then we visited once and seemed like they were pretty uh but i guess there is a difference between uh day care for kids that are couple years away from school and and uh child care for now you you and your wife both work right um-hum yeah yeah the uh the lady who keeps she keeps uh six children and uh she she really recommends to that uh so when when like when Helen gets a little closer to starting kindergarten that she'd be you know put into a regular um day care so that they can they can learn more uh uh like the alphabet and the numbers and all that stuff uh although she's she's really good she uh uh she makes little uh like handprints you you know Helen's hand and then puts little designs on them you know and you know so she uh she takes a pretty active role and and uh oh yeah um our little girl she was uh premature and so she had um she was on a monitor uh heart monitor and uh that was no problem you know with the uh with the babysitter she you know took it right in stride uh-huh she i i guess with the right person if uh as opposed to some of these day care centers where they have two hundred kids or something like that or i don't know how many kids they've got but where they have lots and lots of kids it's it's much tougher to uh um-hum to rely on it's much easier to rely on one person if they're good they're good and if they're bad well you know yeah that's that's that's the the finding a good one that's that's the hard part um i think you probably have a better chance with a day care they're they're probably it's more of an average so that that there's less chance of having a a bad one yeah well on the average on the well on on the average they might do uh uh gosh how should i say this you're going for the average the average kid is going to be treated better but yeah but you won't have the the uh you won't have the risk of getting a real bad one everybody everybody knows that they've got a a bad one on the other hand uh that's with uh with a person who's taking care of them in their own home that's yeah if they're good like i say you can be pretty sure that they're good and uh so i if they're not so good if they're kind of lazy why the kid's probably yeah uh could tell you i i personally would rather have my kids uh stay with uh you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose if they have two or three good people and they lose one you'll never know it you just pick your kid up from school and yeah yeah and uh and see the other question i had is uh so do you plan on on uh keeping her in day care until she goes to school i think uh well i think we're going to keep her where she's at now until she's about uh three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care that has uh more children and uh and also where they have like the pre kindergarten type of uh environment does does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself uh she she has like uh occasional help that comes in okay i i wondered about that because uh i know some people that do that and uh-huh you know moms can never get sick well a a day care mother uh can never  so uh how do you go about doing household finances pretty loosely i don't have a i've never have a yeah me too had a tremendously organized budget i've you know kind of know how much the monthly bills are by you know looking at the previous month and i know about what the minimum payments are so i just kind of put it down on paper and and estimate but as far as actually having a real tight uh organized budget that you stay within i've i've just always kind of freelanced as far as that goes boy me too it's uh fly by the seat of my pants uh in the old days when my wife and i both worked we we probably a little bit more organized with it because we would divide up the bills she had her own checking account and she would take responsibility for paying so many bills and i had my own and i would take responsibility for so many and and generally entertainment expense so uh everything seemed to work out pretty smoothly but uh that was for about the first uh eighteen years of our marriage then she dropped out of the work force and uh we we have two children both under four so uh oh wow i i've taken total responsibility but i guess i haven't taken you've got two now under four yeah yeah wow they'll be yeah they'll be uh four and two in April respectively i've got a senior in high school who's just just getting out in May we're probably the same age yeah i'm forty four forty two yeah most most of my friends have uh children uh you who are having children it seems like and but uh we we actually ran one checkbook with i mean one account with two checkbooks off the same account for a long for a long time um-hum but that's real dangerous when one is supposed to make a deposit and doesn't or or writes an extra couple of checks and either forgets to tell the other one about it or something you know so we finally switched to yeah the two method too it seemed to work better yeah i think when uh uh when we were both running separate checking accounts i think there was uh more of a sense of respectful responsibility uh it almost demanded coordination in splitting up bills and stuff oh sure now it's my paycheck i put it in and i pay the bills and uh uh it doesn't i'm not being critical but my wife kind of has the sense that the checkbook is just a blank check you know and it's unlimited funds not that she goes out and spends it unlimitedly but it's almost that attitude you still got checks you still got money right yeah right yeah that's yeah that's kind of how it comes out well we been we each have our own business and so especially once that got established it was easier for her to run her deal and me to run mine and uh not really uh um mix the two and uh the you know bills that are if we're both paying on a certain thing like the a school tuition then one or of the other of us writes the other one a check for their portion and then one person mails it all you know to the to the bank or whoever um-hum if it's something we're doing that way if it's uh if it's something that one or the other of us is handling in its entirety then then we just pay it like you do yeah well how how do you manage control uh or limit your spending or or you know do you uh in our in our case it's more of a a philosophy like you know for the next few months we're really going to watch it and we'll try try to control the big things well uh it's kind of the way it is it's it's never been uh like my brother is organized to the n-th degree he and i are exactly opposite he's two years younger than i am and he budgets every penny he knows where every little thing is and he's a real tight wad with uh the money and i've always been a little looser um-hum well that's how we both are and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh during a a certain period of time if we got a little excess and decide to splurge and buy something you know then that's kind of a joint yeah we we thing too so yeah we went through a period uh well we went through six years of infertility and it uh it was expensive we were writing out checks for you know eight hundred dollar prescriptions and medical procedures and all of that oh yeah those are and my wife was working at the time so it it and most of it was you know reimbursable on insurance so we had you know big cash flow and it was a little bit of a management problem but it wasn't too difficult with the two incomes and then we got to the point where we really decided we probably couldn't have children so we sort of indulged and we uh leased some expensive cars and took a vacation yeah it that'll do it everytime you immediately get pregnant if you do that well that's what exactly what happened yeah we  well the main uh two recycling efforts i see in this neighborhood are at work um somebody got the idea of collecting all the phone books together and it's probably several tons of them uh-huh and uh white paper computer paper and stuff like that and the other one would be the local grocery stores have got um newspaper bins i just recently noticed a magazine bin which is really nice and now i've got a place to dump all these things but a really prominent sign is that until recently they accepted those plastic milk jugs uh-huh uh-huh and they're probably the main you know source of those things in the first place but they've quit taking those now huh which is a little disturbing uh is that because they can't do anything with them or uh i don't know i was under the impression that they were converting or that the two liter plastic bottles could be um chipped down and used for a lot of things like uh carpet industry's pretty big in the northern part of the state here um-hum and i've heard that some of the companies make their carpets completely from that stuff but i don't know if there's any use for those strange opaque milk carton type um plastic jugs or not uh-huh yeah i don't even know what they're made out of urethane or yeah they seem to be a pretty nasty kind thing whatever that is something like that yeah yeah we've actually got uh see there's several different bins at the work place and at home we've got several different recycling things going on and um uh at home we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oil you know engine oil oh very good which is a hard one to get get rid of yeah yeah to you know plastic milk jugs and bottles and stuff like that so we have it all sort of separated out in bags by the time he comes around he comes around a couple times a week then we have um there's a recycling center down at uh park not far from us uh where if you really have big loads you can go in and separate it yourself so there's all uh you know all the different categories categories of stuff i don't know if they break it out in plastics between milk jugs and other things but i think it's like plastics glass paper yeah hm and then uh at work this actually kind of a funny story uh for a long time the the guys who ran the company i work for we're kind of resistant to uh any kind of recycling because they felt like it was just going to cost them money or something yeah that's kind of reasonable and uh so they put up uh eventually you know there's enough pressure and they put up they put up a couple different uh bins one of them was for paper which everybody gets everybody gets a paper bin in their office but there're so many restrictions on what you can toss in there that it's almost more of pain than it's worth um yeah no you know no clips no staples you know and so it's kind of it's kind of a pain you have to get get in that habit yep and uh the other ones uh they have for aluminum cans they also have and this is sort of the funniest part they had a styrofoam recycling thing going on i understand and they were actually yeah they were actually um in the uh staff meetings that we used to have there was this guy who's job it was to sort of track that and every month he would actually report how much money never heard of that one before of this company made on recycling and so he'd say you know and i'd like to report that we made twenty five dollars and two cents on styrofoam cup recycling so we were we were always making jokes about you know maybe we could fold that over into computer purchases or something like that you know so by the year you know twenty fifty you know we could buy a or something you know with but uh that's an interesting one never heard of styrofoam recycling before yep so that seems like a prime candidate for recycling though yeah for uh well they they actually took sort of the reverse approach to start with they just decided well we won't we won't let anybody use anything styrofoam so they stopped buying coffee cups and stuff like that which is a real pain you know because i mean not everybody uh wonders in with their coffee cup i mean a lot of us haven't been you know yeah and those packing peanuts are hard to avoid in a business too yeah yeah so anyway so we we have a lot of things lot of things going on i actually i'm i'm a big uh i'm a big recycling fan i think it's pretty important actually hear about all these stories about uh plastics and stuff showing up out in the ocean you know choking animals and stuff like that it's pretty pretty gory uh yeah yeah they'll last forever yeah all these millions of years nothing has um evolved to take care of that stuff uh there there's actually a company out um uh straight west of us in Strasburg Virginia that makes arm rests for cars in mass quantities in fact virtually every piece of trim that you see on the inside of your car Japanese or American these guys make hm and uh so it's a giant plastics plant i think they have a seventy like a seventy five percent market share or something do they use a lot of recycled goods for their raw material uh i think they use a lot of recycled plastic but the funny thing about it is is that they have because of certain  so how do you like the benefits of TI um well actually to tell you the truth uh not very well i resigned from Texas Instruments not shortly oh that's right yeah ago and found that my uh after having worked there for twenty one years my vested interest in my pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary yeah that's that's one problem with uh engineering jobs is it's you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a either 401K well i guess you get part of into 401K one oh 401K but what what is the uh key health plan that people who are privately employed use um i don't know uh the the uh i guess i guess the that that issue was a TI retirement uh benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits right um if you don't retire you get shit um-hum uh but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you can't do that you can't just kiss them off if they don't retire and so there's some nominal uh amount amount that has to be vested with the employee but uh in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean uh it's time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by invoking this uh defined benefits plan yeah what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on your last salary when you left the company so you know let's say you've worked there for twenty years right you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone um you know your twenty years is worthless just because it's it's not an index to fund it's based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there right which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account yeah um of course the initial question that was asked related to uh actually i can't remember anymore but to it benefits benefits in general it related to what do you look for in a position other than salary and i guess my mind before it referred to benefits my mind was not thinking a long the with the ideas lines of benefits at all but rather um career gratification gratification and you know that kind of thing um-hum well that's one thing you do get with a large company they're you know it's well it's actually can go both ways something some ways you have more opportunities because there're so many things going on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project um-hum and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in to to any area they want to um-hum um-hum boy i there there were some something happened to your signal your signal at that point did you notice it yeah there there was some clicking on the line i'm not sure what yeah whether that's local or somewhere in the long distance network between New Jersey and wherever you are in California California okay or whether it's part of the uh switchboard system this is also possible yeah somewhere between Texas well party of my part of my reason for coming to California was California um-hum uh it is it i love it it's a wonderful place but the the price of housing is is just totally looney well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesn't it gets cheaper again but then again there's you you well that's true up in Redding uh the housing prices are probably comparable to Dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are um-hum about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous yeah i know New Jersey is just slightly above the national average which was yeah it's about twice the price of Atlanta at any rate but uh the housing the housing prices have definitely dropped so i guess one of the things you look for in a job uh is um affordable cost of living yeah cost cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work yes not so great for the family but uh  okay um i guess i'm not real familiar with recycling because i've been in the army for twenty years so uh oh you're an environmental engineer's dream uh right so uh actually the first my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small community near here and they they gave each household one of these plastic uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in uh-huh and uh then when we moved into the townhouse where we are now there there again there was no recycling program and now there is uh and uh so we we're recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which that's great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is going to be one of the keys to uh recycling success um-hum um i know here we have in my community now we're i'm in unincorporated i'm in the county by i'm unincorporated um-hum uh within a certain city limits there's there's more uh uh more i i i just want to say better programs here we have uh trash pickup twice a week and on the first day they'll pickup aluminum cans and on the second they'll pick up newspapers um-hum um-hum hm and um i think those are you know the kind of the core um-hum crops if you will just to because they're the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle uh right ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and that's on Thursday oh are is is your community recycling sponsored by your local government so uh um-hum yeah it's just a small town and it's uh it's locally sponsored i don't know what they do with it uh that always uh uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh yeah there're a lot of different ways to recycle you can um especially with the plastics you can melt them down and reform them or you can actually recycle them and it depends on whether they segregate the different types of plastics there're seven main types um-hum um-hum hm now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that i think part of the recycling responsibility falls uh not only with the local or county governments but with the individuals as well right because uh the individual family is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled that's right and so i've kind of looked for because i'm interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling i've looked for those things that i can recycle oh that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example what i do is uh oh you do organic gardening recycle the grass clippings and all the leaves that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my neighbors rake up for me it's uh oh how wonderful you're doing so well it's neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection and uh uh-huh right so then i just uh get as much as i need which sometimes embarrasses my wife she says please don't pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it uh-huh see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i yeah that's wonderful i'd love i'm i have tried not too diligently to get involved with that organic gardening composting i have two dogs and they would eat every bit of compost i'd put out there and i fenced it off with chicken wire about two or three feet high um-hum hm uh-huh and they'd jump over the wire just to eat the little egg shells and potato peels and just whatever they could put their little jaws on it was awful really so you you have dogs that are vegetarians huh gee that's odd yeah people people say it's just part of my Karma i'm not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact i've got some corn beef on the stove right now but i uh hm oh don't eat much meat or as much as i used to but my dogs since i've been eating more produce um-hum um-hum eat more produce anyway they they do to huh yeah well that's odd i'd never heard of dogs eating uh vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and yeah they'll yeah fruits and vegetable leftovers or scra pses that uh it does not attract animals huh um because there's no meat in it or anything or fish or anything like that well yeah that's interesting that you have dogs that are attracted to compost well they guess they'll be healthy dogs yeah yeah well with my luck they'll live forever huh right so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings i look at what i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have um-hum that i can use in the gardening  okay Michelle well since i started off i uh since i called in i guess i'll state my opinion first okay and uh i i guess i'd fall in the same category that i don't think there should be any restrictions i think that if unless a weapon is self-propelled or has to be towed Americans should be able to own it okay um i really don't know exactly where i stand just to be honest i have mixed feelings about it and i've thought about both positions i would like to have the freedom to own a firearm um i am currently married and that makes me feel more secure but if i were single i would definitely want to have a firearm uh-huh um-hum uh of course i think it should be locked up you know so that children can not absolutely get their hands on it i agree i think parents should be held responsible if their child gets a hold of one or either injures injures another person or or themselves um-hum definitely definitely i also am in favor of a check i i think the criminal record system in the country should be brought up to snuff so that they can run a computer check as easy as they do when you run a credit card through so they can see if a person insane or is a felon yeah right now i've heard a lot of people say that that wouldn't do any good but i really think that it makes a lot of sense i don't it wouldn't do any good right now because the criminal record systems are a mess you know i mean there really isn't any any system as such but if there were and if the government were to invest in that then there wouldn't be any problem they'd uh-huh they'd be able to identify those that shouldn't have what do you mean the criminal records are a mess well there isn't any computerized system that can tell you you know by the push of a button yeah i mean in Virginia has done it by the way reason i i'm a life member of the Gun Owners and i am sure no longer member of the NRA so i i'm kind of into this but Virginia Virginia does have an instance check uh system uh-huh uh-huh they do have their records within a state computerized and it seems to be working well and if it could be done on a federal basis hm are they the only state the only state that i'm aware of gosh that's done that so what has to take place them to to make this happen to other states well uh that makes a lot of sense yeah it really you know it's it should be done on a national basis because on the statewide basis you just get those that have violated state laws but you're right right yeah and some there are federal you know violators too uh-huh uh-huh so it would require an investment on the part of the government to to bring their records up to shape but i think it's uh probably a good investment anyway uh um-hum so you're from New Hampshire yes um-hum i'm not even i hate to admit uh that familiar with what the laws are here in Texas regarding purchasing a firearm um uh-huh uh-huh i guess you heard about the the massacre in that's only about an hour in fact that's where all my cousins live i used to go down there every summer oh yes um-hum so that was a real shocker you know uh in that case uh in particular that fellow that did that had owned those guns a long time yeah that's true so i mean it's not like he went in and picked them up and uh then went off on a shooting spree um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah so it um it couldn't have been avoided by you know any type of law being and uh set that's right but unfortunately whenever something like happens that happens uh people tend to blame the gun and not the person it is it's it is the person yeah this is true yeah oh i tend to agree with you in in that i believe that that that like you're saying the majority i believe would be responsible with with the weapon and Lord knows with the crime rate the way it is um-hum we need to have something to protect ourselves yeah i feel that you should be you know you uh if you were single should be allowed to have a weapon to yourself uh-huh uh-huh but if it yeah i know how to use it um-hum but if there were a total ban you know who'd have the guns oh yeah oh sure it wouldn't be it wouldn't be the people who'd go to buy them honestly uh-huh yeah it would be the people that you know could get in touch with the underground or something and i mean they have ways right that's right and gun control laws don't stem them because uh they don't they don't most of the criminals don't go buy their guns uh from a gun store anyway yeah they get them through the through the black market yeah yeah you're right that's what i was thinking well well it's uh it's certainly a a lengthy subject and there's a lot of it is it's very complex there's a lot of uh discussion about it and what and now and then it becomes a heated argument in both sides but um-hum um-hum um-hum but i i've i just feel that the founders of our country the constitution people that wrote the constitution didn't intend for us to not have a means to protect ourselves either either from without the country or from within the country yeah yeah do you do a lot of hunting no i don't i used to i i used to now i'm just a target shooter yeah i used to go uh with your guns are you so do you  okay um we're talking about uh trial by jury and whether or not we thought it was a a fair way to do it do you think that they ought to have the uh the judge do the sentencing to try to make it more uniform or more fair or or what do you think uh well um i think that uh when you're tried by a jury of your peers they probably uh the collective mind of the jury is probably a better vehicle for sentencing than the judge himself uh because then there's the consensus thing rather than a uh a single person well there there is an argument in that uh a judge has seen a lot more cases and you know perhaps he sees one crime um-hum and and he can compare that crime to you know his long history of of of dealing with with criminals and uh um-hum the the jury you know this is you know maybe they've sat on sat on a jury once before maybe this is their very first time the only they've really seen is like Gaudy on TV or something like that you know and and they just you know they just kind of um-hum you know making guesses how bad they think it is yeah well i would i could i would argue back that uh a a single person being able to pass a sentence on someone um leaves it open to his or her own uh biases and they may consider arson to be a heinous crime and child molestation to be less severe so the sentence wouldn't be all that uniformed i mean obviously it would be uniform within the parameters of that judge himself him or herself yeah yeah as as uniformed as i mean he would he would figure out the severity based upon his own personal scale the only thing i worry about is like one um one murderer or or let's say one one thief um getting like a tenth of the penalty of of another thief simply because perhaps he impressed the jury more or or you know just because because his presentation was better uh-huh yeah that's a that's one of the biggest uh biggest problems i think in our society is that uh the the justice system uh basically goes by who's got enough money for the best lawyer and uh the presentation is is everything um so you know you you could have a real dirt ball yeah be portrayed by his lawyer as a loving family man and and uh color the color the jury's opinions but um i don't know exactly see i would almost argue i would consider i i i don't understand i don't know i haven't thought it out long enough to figure out all the ramifications but getting rid of the entire trial by jury and and having the judge decide guilty or not guilty well we could do that or we could explode it to it's logical extreme or it's or ridiculous extreme and take uh the new interactive television uh technology that's coming forward and uh have everybody in the country or everyone who chose to tune in decide guilt or innocence and then uh have a sliding scale of you know the fifty nine percent of the people said you were guilty that means you get the life in prison you know um oh oh man Wheel of Justice we could have a game show you know we no there there it it does need reform uh i would worry about a single judge uh uh passing sentence uh especially in in a more involved trial uh i i don't know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and the reason the reason that we went away from the single judge or the the the triad i guess of judges that they have uh in some systems it just um you know they become instruments of the government and yeah but i think the the we the people that that our founding fathers were talking about were rich white males um-hum i mean i don't think i i don't think they had a real high opinion of of the masses i mean Hamilton was was a prime case you know he he didn't i think he referred to them as the mindless masses he didn't want them to vote he didn't want them to have any say in government oh yeah that's why they uh made election days on Tuesday in November you know Tuesday was a work day and November was a real pain to travel in November back in what seventeen eighty three um right you know that never occurred to me so i you know they sort of arranged it so that and you know and the electoral college is all rigged anyway i mean in theory they have to vote for whoever the delegates choose but it's you know it they don't have to um well i mean only one sense it seems like a needless step but i think there's only been one person who haven't voted as he was voted into or there's only i think only been one electoral vote that was not not voted at in the electoral college um-hum as the propular as the popular vote was voted um-hum well we're straying from our topic of jury so  okay i think we're all set there hopefully well uh care of the elderly is something that is hitting pretty close to home at me uh right now my father-in-law has uh been diagnosed with terminal cancer and my mother-in-law is in a wheel chair so this is something that i've been thinking quite a bit about lately and uh i'm i feel pretty strongly and the rest of my family does that is long as someone is able to care for uh someone else that they shouldn't be put in a home but there's there's a very hard question of of what happens when someone isn't able to provide that care for themselves um in the case of my mother-in-law she's not able to to bathe herself but she's sharp as a tack at this point and what sort of facilities are available for that person it's hard because you think of a home and you're really thinking of of uh old people left somewhere to uh you know fairly forgotten and that's that's that's a hard thing and i'm sure not all of them are like that well unfortunately that's the typical picture though yeah so it's it's very hard to find a facility that would allow uh allow someone of fair degree of autonomy in their life but yet would still be there to help provide some of the basic services is your mother-in-law currently uh living in a nursing home or anything no she's not um she's still at home and her son has has moved back into the house uh which which was not as inconvenient as it sounds because uh um my father-in-law and my brother-in-law have a dental lab in the basement so he was working out of the house anyway uh so it it's a little less uh it's it's not all that inconvenient for him but the rest of the kids are scattered uh throughout the northeast and he doesn't want to feel that he's uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws have you guys thought about the financial burden of caring for your mother-in-law as far as putting her in a nursing home down the road that that has we've all thought about that fortunately uh that doesn't seem to be a big problem but that we there's some thought that has to be given to to uh to the property for instance they have about four three or four acres in Connecticut and what no one wants to see is uh that land having to be sold off simply to keep her in a in a nursing home what we'd like to do is uh find the sort of place where i try described before where she'd be able to have uh a place of her own but yet also have someone come in a couple of times a day to help her with various various things and have someone there in case she falls or something well my mother my grandmother is in a place similar to that where she has emergency buttons throughout the throughout the house or actually the apartment um-hum and she's about eighty one and she lives she has her own little area for gardening and so forth it's in the housing authority up here um-hum and it's that's great when she first moved up here she ended up living in uh tall apartment building a complex that was very similar to a hospital um-hum a very negative feeling when you walked in the building right and now she's been very fortunate in that she's almost almost like living in a small home that's that's great and she she still has an a large maintenance staff take care of the place look after her provide uh basic busing services and travel um-hum uh i'm hoping that the trend is toward places like that as the population in America uh lives for a longer period of time uh i i guess thirty years ago when when you were that age and you weren't able to really care for yourself you really weren't going to uh you know be around that much longer and so the level of care required was was different but now people are are living longer and can uh can have injury  uh consumer products and you have you ever recently uh returned returned anything recently well most recently the kinds of things i've been returned actually are uh are parts of you know repair parts repair parts for cars or something uh oh for for cars or for plumbing parts that kind of thing actually surplus parts that you know you need you think you need it and uh want to make sure you've got everything you need and taking things back and so uh other than that uh you know i haven't had an opportunity where i've needed to return something due to uh poor service or you know failure of it uh huh i guess nope no lemons huh no no i guess well the closest thing we did have is couple weeks ago uh starter on our daur daughter's car failed and so i had to uh try and find a replacement on a Sunday which in south is not very easy we don't have a whole lot of Sunday shopping for those kinds of things and uh and actually then it ended up with needing to found the parts but then there were some recent very recent repairs on the starter done and uh so my daughter took it back to the repair shop that did the work for her hundred and forty miles from here and they gave her money back right away well that's good presented you know tried to present a sound case for defective equipment and everything went very well that's a long way to go usually doesn't yeah well she's going to school there right now so you know she was headed back there so certainly wouldn't make an extra trip for fifty dollars for a hundred miles but uh she was headed back there so oh that's good worked out well how about yourself you had any recent uh experiences where with products that you've had to return well it's been difficult i don't know i haven't really returned anything because there's a lot of inertia to get through that process um-hum um uh actually no i have tried to get it fixed for example i've had a i guess a uh a VCR um-hum and uh it was uh brand new and uh pretty pretty top of the line type of VCR and i had problems with it uh recording uh things uh something it would it was strange uh you can fast forward play through it and you'd see this uh picture on there but if you played it normal it would go in and out uh between uh blue program screen and the actual um-hum thing that was being recorded it was very bizarre and the maintenance said it was due to weak signals i'm saying well you know i'm paying this a lot of money for this uh VCR and you're telling me just because it hasn't doesn't have a you know a strong enough signal it'll do this and that's strange because if it's if it's not strong enough then why is it that when you uh go slow motion or freeze frame or fast forward through it you can see the picture but when it uh you play it normal it goes in and out that's very bizarre to me and uh i have the worst time trying to just get him look at this problem and it ends up that they you know they just uh concluded that's that's all that's wrong with it and that's nothing nothing nothing wrong with the product and i said at the yeah well that's i guess that's one of the frustrations you end up talking with people that uh you know just great think they have considerable knowledge and uh you're not really convinced that they do and you almost end up bringing a third party in that uh you have trust in their competence um-hum uh now it's not my position to advise and i don't have that experience with it certainly sounds like a bill of goods trying to be sold to you well i don't know it's uh it's hard to say it's there's there's nothing i could it didn't seem like there was much i could do about it uh yeah and i don't know if it's really getting better or worse um in that case it didn't really get any better you know or you know um i guess in situations like that are there other manufacturers or other companies that uh you can consult uh no i don't know you know like a similar product somebody that sells a similar product and say this you know am i getting the right kind of story here yeah well a lot of them probably say they don't know anything about it i don't know it just a lot of them give you the line uh you know we have repair car repair's the same problem uh yeah yeah things like that uh with all the electronics in the cars say but say say it gets a lot better gas mileage and  okay so what do you think about space flying uh well uh i was just reading something on it as a matter of fact uh just got uh latest copy of uh Analog magazine and it had an article in it on uh uh a new oh yeah a new version of propulsion that they're looking at um are you familiar with uh the solar sail idea um-hum yeah i i i have read a couple articles on it yeah uh well this is apparently what they call a magnetic sail oh okay um basically they just uh set up a large uh magnetic field and uh it's works a lot like sailing on the ocean uh and is a lot more flexible than using solar sails right hm so basically would they uh would they essentially in terms of magnetism magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so you'd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw um that's the thing about it is you can switch it depending on the circumstance oh interesting um and it also works uh you can use it to uh pull yourself out of like a low earth orbit uh by using the earth's magnetic field and moving from there and it also acts like um um-hum right like a uh uh uh i don't know it's called it's a it's a shield against uh radiation and and flare and that sort of thing because it builds up um static charger it builds out a a magnetic barrier around it uh kind of like the earth's magnetoshpere and uh protects the people that way yeah right oh that's pretty interesting yeah yeah personally i think that uh we don't spend enough on space exploration and i think we probably should spend more just because it you know it it not only benefits uh yeah space per se but it also benefits technology you know you start to develop things specifically for space use and you know the offspring technologies can benefit a whole lot of different aspects of society so that's it's that and you also have the benefit of the things that you just don't know about yet i mean the biggest the biggest uh thing that comes from yeah space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea we're going to discover it's it's all the surprises the problem with that is you can't sure yeah it's it preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we don't know what we're going to discover yeah that's kind of that's kind of hard to defend in some ways but you know also you got to consider that it's this space exploration could give us a lot of different view points on on current problems um primary of which in my mind right now is uh the whole thing with uh the depleting ozone ozone layer you know i was reading an article about that the other day and it's amazing really amazing how much we're losing uh how much of the ozone layer's really disappearing there's an article in Time magazine about it but you know things like that can be very well uh studied from space you know and using satellites and space technology and things like that um-hum uh i think that's real important and if we if we don't look at that closely we could be really screwing ourselves uh i don't know it's it's it's an it's an interesting thing because it's like you said some of the positions seem untenable at least when you're trying to defend them in in congress and things like that people tend not to have a very long term view like to look at more uh more short term problems which you know they're logical and they're and they're very prevalent you know things like world hunger yeah that's a big uh that's a big problem um but you've got to have a long term view as well yeah the problems with things like world hunger are that throwing money at it doesn't make it go away it just it just it stop gap um yeah yes exactly most people will will try to to solve the symptoms without really looking at the uh the problem itself yeah with space exploration it's a lot like um like trying to jump into a new industry you've got huge start up costs uh lot bigger in this case than in most others but once you're established there um-hum i think it would you know i think it's obvious to everyone that it would be highly profitable uh once you've reached a certain level it just takes right you start that rather substantial long term commitment you know for a for a number of years or or even several decades in order to to get it up to the standard where you need it uh in order to go from there um sure where where do you work where do i work um i used to be uh an auditor uh for one of the big six accounting firms i'm currently uh uh-huh oh okay uh running uh a game or one of the three principal partners in a game company oh okay great yeah i was just i was asking because it's interesting to see where we're both coming from i personally am kind of biased because right now i'm working for Honeywell um um-hum  well well i have a a a new puppy in this house it's been i've had her here about two weeks oh oh well actually i put a dog of that i'd had for seventeen years to sleep about a month ago you got any pets oh that's too bad yeah so that's uh um i'm thinking about getting another one but i don't know in the mean time i have a cat that's uh nearly twenty pounds and the the vet assures me it he has a large bone structure so but just a big old Tom so we're still uh in the in the paper stage i guess if you put your seventeen year old dog away while back you have it's been a long time since that was the case yes oh what sort of puppy do you have well it we took you know it's from a shelter it's a mix of uh gee i guess uh uh Shepherd and um and a black Lab oh those are the best kind so it's going to be a monster yeah yeah that that's where i got uh my dog was from the shelter and the idea was to get a Shepherd Lab mix and he turned out to be about half that size um he he i just couldn't resist him at the shelter so uh he was well he was at least eighteen when he died because he was full grown when i got him so you don't know how old he was when you got him i really don't huh did you uh did you have him fixed or was he uh was he he he was fixed his name was Randy oh great with uh good cause and uh so i got him fixed i guess that's a good plan he wasn't fixed when you got him though huh but no no yeah i it's uh i've never um had an animal that long never i was it was a hard thing to do well well he was real sick huh he just was real arthritic uh and then just stopped eating you know it was real it was real clear that you know it was it was time to go oh time times were over well that's a that's a that's a shame that yeah but this uh well eventually i guess so you going to get another one eventually i i haven't yet but they're a lot of work too yes they are they are indeed the the hardest part is the stage you have right now i think yeah yeah but you know but get little i got little kids and they they do a pretty good job of taking care of the dog and so forth so that'll be fun for them oh i think pets are wonderful for kids any yeah used to teaches them responsibility and all that kind of stuff too at least in theory my kids could use it yeah oh okay well you think that gives them uh the uh what what they're looking for here but well i i guess i um sometimes have been told in well yeah i guess that's fine so thanks for calling talking well it's nice to talk to you good night now good night  well this is something i just got back from working out yes um i'd spend about five or ten minutes stretching and then i i used to be just a walker i i was really into walking about three miles everyday and oh did you i'd go to the weight room and and and get in every part of my arms and work on legs uh-huh but now i'm training to run and i i fun run here in Tyler and it's just two miles but um i'm up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and then i'll run a mile and then i'll cool down and feel like i'm going to die but it's a lot of fun for me it's it's a task when i don't feel like it that's great yeah yeah that's true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or but most of the time it's fun huh no um in college and the junior college i'm going to right now has a really good fitness center uh-huh and so they have a cardiovascular room where they have a Stairmaster oh that's great uh-huh and sometimes i do that i kind of got burned out on the Stairmaster and uh they have a real good weight room and i do a lot of free weights free weights more than machines i enjoy those more yeah uh-huh oh huh i've been uh i'm more i've never seriously seriously lifted weights i wrestled in high school and i couldn't and they always made us and i hated it and stuff hadn't done it since but uh-huh uh now i'm just more of a recreational sport player i don't really do much exercising other than i play softball five or six nights a week and uh-huh uh some basketball but i've God i've never have since high school i don't think i've been on a serious or uh exercise program course it shows getting a little bit heavier but uh i have a hard time going out and running though that's that's pretty difficult for me to do i don't know why but yeah yeah yeah it's it's pretty difficult for me too but i've got one month to train for the two mile run i'm fixing to do um-hum uh-huh and that's not very fun fun fun you know that's not very far to run and a month isn't very long and they call it a fun run i don't see how they can put fun and and run together yeah yeah well are you are you doing it yeah yeah it's true are you running for serious or you just running to kind of get through for the fun of it or do they and i'm running to get in shape yeah i'm in i'm in really good shape now but uh i've only been seriously in a workout program since September are you um-hum um-hum so i'm knocking close on a year just to be you know mean you know almost but um i'm just i really i had a partner last semester in school that was into body building and he'd been in it for about three years yeah um-hum oh and so he really got me into lifting weights and i and i did that a lot for the first time i i got i went into a weight room in September and it was real intimidating i was one of the only girls and uh that didn't help any uh-huh uh-huh yeah i'll bet no but uh i got started into that and i ended up gaining uh almost ten pounds from muscle oh really just in muscle though just in muscle well i i had a bigger appetite too so no i actually i lost size yeah uh-huh but i gained in weight you know because of muscle but now i'm trying to to get rid of some of the bulkiness yeah yeah and my arms got quite a bit bigger and i i didn't really want them to get that much bigger so now i'm i'm doing they say to define your muscles yeah um-hum you do a lot less weight and a lot of repetition so that's what i'm working on now yeah so how often you go and lift then do you do it daily or well um i go Monday through Friday i walk and run but um um-hum yesterday i wasn't feeling good so i missed Monday and i'm out of town on Friday so i'm going to have to go on Saturday so i'll at least get four days in yeah uh-huh yeah well that's great yeah i i'm trying to like i said i play softball of course not in the winter up here but uh i usually do something for about two months just to get me in shape for that i do a lot of sit-ups and push-ups but but uh uh-huh uh-huh i still like i say the running and i've we've been meaning to buy some mountain bikes i hard part for about me for running is just i don't ooh you see the same thing you never go far enough to see anything really different and i like the change of scenery and stuff so that's why i was thinking of my wife and i about getting a bike for each of us and then you know we you can go right yeah do you live in the mountains uh we live right close by them we i live right at the base of the Wasatch mountains here and so i close enough that we there's trails and everything all of the way around and that we can go up and use and we go camping quite a bit and we take them with us you know we take them with us there so oh uh-huh uh-huh there's a lot of area we can go in up around there i have just one little daughter do you have any kids oh my goodness you know and actually that's my exercise now just trying to keep up with an eighteen month old that's more than enough so eighteen months yeah she's well she learned to walk about six months ago and she hasn't stopped she she just ongoing so we chase her around the house all the time so it's uh you get a little of exercise in on that oh yeah we do believe me there's nothing like having a kid to chase that'll do it for you well i'm going to wait a long time till that happens i'm i'm i'll be twenty May sixth and i'm just going to get through college and hopefully move to some different states yeah uh-huh good idea uh-huh and stay single for a while but in the mean time i'm i'm trying to stay in shape and i i love to play racquetball not a bad idea yeah  well um i live at the beach and yeah and we don't really have a lot of recycling here well yeah but you have do you have a lot in Rochester we have a lot of recycling in Rochester they do uh what they call curb side pick up okay and so they come by and they'll pick up uh the newspapers and cardboard and uh different colors of glass and uh see what else tin cans and uh plastic like you know your milk jugs and you know soap soap soap bottle uh jugs and all that type of stuff oh so they just pick up everything yeah so do they do any uh any sort of recycling back down where you are well i think they do some voluntary on the beach but i live in apartments and we don't have it here um-hum okay um in Wilmington they have it there more i think and that's like the big town near us um-hum but um i really wish they would have it okay do uh i mean what do you think they ought to be doing down there in terms of doing more recycling and things like that well sometimes i don't feel so bad i mean it's really i mean it this is really sad too because we have a big dumpster at our apartments and there's this little man that goes through our trash all the time to get the cans out um-hum oh wow that's really unfortunate i know well they do a whole lot of recycling here in Rochester i'm kind of hard pressed to say they ought to do more because i don't know what else they'd pick up i mean you know they they say things like you know they want all the little uh you know those little recycling symbols like the number ones and the number twos and all those things uh-huh well they you know they say they'll pick up anything with number two but they guys who are uh picking it up are are kind of i don't know i guess they aren't well trained because like they say they also say they won't pick up you know the you know like you buy a uh uh uh a six pack of pop and you know the plastic rings that they come in uh-huh uh-huh well nowadays those are coming with a little recycling symbol on them you know with the number two but they won't pick it up because they say well no we don't pick up that we only pick up you know like the milk jugs and soap jugs and stuff like that so i think they could be doing more if they here in Rochester if they just uh quit doing uh you know so much based on what the container is in terms on what used to have in it or something and if they did more on you know what the material is yeah so uh i don't know so they don't do any recycling hardly at all down there well i mean they do some but none of it's mandatory yeah and like i said i live in an apartment complex um-hum and so they don't do it for us okay but some of the houses i've seen some of the bins around some of the houses okay well do you have any place you could take stuff if you wanted to there is a place but it's in Wilmington okay and so it's like a a big hassle you know to try to get everything together and i mean uh you'd have to save it up and have all that stuff lying around your apartment yeah yeah well that's wild i mean like well how far is Wilmington from there it's um about twenty minutes oh wow so you'd have to get everything together and take it over there that'd be a real pain they ought to do the curb side stuff um-hum i know but i just think it's it must be hard to do in an apartment thing like this they do it here i mean they they have it here in Rochester in the apartments and people you know they have to do some special stuff but you know the apartment complex it's not the city see here in Rochester the city does it really um-hum it would like i i own my own house so the city comes by and they pick up you know the stuff on the same day they pick up the trash but for the apartments all the apartment places you know pay somebody to pick up all the trash and so the apartment people you know the the the waste disposal people have to come up with their own system but we passed a law here and they said you just got to do it there's no choice because all the you know all the landfills up here are full yeah now see that i think that's why it's not as strict in the south it's because we still have have a lot of land left yeah oh wow so i mean but i mean people do need to realize that that there's not always going to be land but that's going to change yeah yeah that's going to change at some point you know a couple of years ago nobody around here talked about it and then one day everybody just kind of woke up and said gee you know we're we're in trouble and we got to fix this problem um-hum but i know i went to see my brother in Philadelphia in May and he yeah was in a voluntary program um-hum  i run uh usually a couple of times a week um because i i'm at i'm a student at Rice University and so i can just sort of run a loop around the campus which is about three miles good and um that's sort of i guess it's probably the most common thing i do for exercise the other thing i do is um i try and play racquetball a couple of times a week with um a friend um-hum Bill do you feel safe running across the campus uh yeah actually if i do it uh certainly at night i feel i mean sorry not at night i feel perfectly safe at night i usually do it with someone else um-hum well the area immediately north of you and immediately west of you is not a very good area well let's see um north is sort of the meandrous area which is not uh it's not too bad as far as crime goes i think i mean it's not really great yes um south is the area that's really crime ridden that's sort of the south main area um okay the south main yes okay i know what you're talking about yeah so that that's not too great but the um i usually feel pretty safe around the campus itself uh the uh Rice has their own police department and they're pretty aggressive about um-hum well you've got pretty good fencing around your parameter parameter no actually we don't we don't have fences it's just uh a tall hedge so okay well but uh yeah it does yeah at least it's a psychological barrier so i know you have some separation because my uh son went to Saint Thomas for uh a year and and uh we drove over and looked at Rice with the reason we thought there might some possibilities of of changing but anyway uh i was very impressed with the campus yeah it's really it's a pretty a beautiful campus especially considering it's in the middle of the ugly city like Houston but uh yeah uh my exercise program i used i did run uh for several reasons i now do mostly walking uh one was that i had a knee injury i stepped in a in a crack or a whole twisted my knee and it was very painful hm yeah and the other is i'm getting older now so it makes more sense to walk than it does to run yeah i can um one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky um-hum well the emotional the emotional benefits of running are almost as good as the physical benefits i use it as stress relief yeah yeah that too i mean uh the um but the reason why i noticed you were talking about walking i i don't if i walk i'd have to walk like ten miles i think to you know for it to really sort of get the same benefit as running if i run uh really hard yeah um-hum that's true and that that may just be that may just be me or you know whatever i'm sure i'm sure when i get older i'll probably i'll be more of a workout but yeah well i walk forty five i walk forty five to fifty minutes that's pretty good yeah which is uh between two and three miles at a at a fairly comfortable uh yeah the last time i was doing an aggressive running program i was in graduate school about um oh it's i guess it's been ten years ago now but uh anyway i was doing i was running three miles a day five times a week and that wow that that that's a fair amount that's more than i do by a considerable amount well that was that was because i was in graduate school and i was doing about a sixty hour week yeah and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control yeah yeah no i understand that i mean i i sometimes you know feel like uh well one reason another another reason why i run rather than do something like walk is uh it takes a long time yes because it's sort of the same work out but but yeah i can i sort of you know am able to you know sleep better and and be more uh more alert um when i'm you know when i am awake if i if i exercise regularly so it really it's kind of like an investment that pays off i've never tried the handball do you find that helps you a lot well i mean it's kind of it's it's you know it's good exercise especially when you get good at it because you the idea is to make the other player run to where he's not i mean you hit the ball it's kind of like tennis in that sense but you're not chasing always chasing after the ball um um-hum yes i yes but uh the reason why i do like that a little bit better than running if i can find uh you know people to play with because it's more it's more interesting i mean there's you know like a game aspect to it as well as just sort of the exercise um-hum right and as long as you keep moving you have the aerobic effect and i i'm sure if you have a half way good player you do keep running yeah oh yeah yeah yeah and it took a little it took a little while to to get good i mean the first you know i don't know two or three weeks of playing uh you know to i didn't really get that great of work out but but it now i it's pretty good um-hum i used to uh years ago play tennis but again uh as you get older tennis is pretty rough on the knees i'm sure handball would be also yeah i can i can understand knee problems because i've found i haven't had trouble with it this year but in past years when i've you know done only running and not racquetball um my um-hum  hi this is David from Florida hi Lee from New York Lee yes okay uh yeah it snowed this morning and it was all gone by noon oh wow so it's getting warmer up there then huh well i don't know yeah i guess it's not really cold it's it's cooling off down here it's going to get down to probably around sixty tonight so oh shucks yeah just as beautiful during the day though i work down here for Pratt Whitney oh yeah and i heard about this over the TechNet on the uh on the computer there at work we get uh electronic mail all the time like the usenet news groups uh not news groups no not really i'm an engineer there oh yeah i saw it on uh something called Comp DCom Telecom okay yeah and what do you do um i'm a county engineer i look mostly at sewage oh okay okay well it's getting kind of late so you want to get started here we're going to talk about taxes i guess uh oh yeah you probably talk all night about this okay well we'll see okay then uh you want to go ahead and start or do you want me to go ahead and start when we hey whatever you like okay i'll i'll i'll let you go ahead and start and then i'll i'll press the one now are you ready here we go okay all right taxes well i think uh people are not getting the money's worth and number two i think people aren't willing to pay good money for a decent value so i got to blame everyone on that oh you why why do you think uh we're not getting our money's worth well i think there's uh some entrenched greed in general mismanagement in government hey i work for the government i you probably see the waste first hand then well we've you know we've got a lot of people who are dedicated and trying to do a good job but we've also got a lot of people that think the world owes them a living and you know they don't want to do anymore than they've um-hum you know than they did last week or they don't want to do any more than the least they can possibly do they have no pride no pride at all yeah right well the the thing that makes me angry about paying taxes i don't mind paying it for services you know for defense uh the country and uh and and for services like roads and for sewage and and for basic water and stuff but when we got to pay for uh some of these people that are on welfare and stuff that's when i get uh i get pretty mad uh i mean i think a lot of that is wasted yeah well there's a lot of money in that and where there's a lot of money there tends to be a lot of uh what is it uh greed deceit mismanagement yeah right i it who was it who wrote Animal Farm George Orwell yeah absolute power corrupts absolutely yes yeah that's that's that's that's true uh i'm not sure what to do about it though uh you know this is a big election this year and everything we all these guys running for president and uh i uh it seems to me that there's this uh basic idea that you shouldn't let people starve to death and that you should have some sort of Christian charity toward them um-hum and that uh people just aren't willing to let people starve to death in the streets if they don't want to work yeah and uh therefore they're not willing to change the systems i got another theory if you want to hear it it's not really mine just that the uh the powers that be mainly you and me what's that are keeping this whole class of people poor and helpless just so they're out of the way no no i don't i don't think we are do do well we're definitely keeping them poor and down trodden and helpless um i i don't agree with that you don't think the welfare system fosters a whole class of people that oh you mean by us paying taxes is a poor step we are doing that indirect oh yes i agree i think that's the way the well yes i i do agree with that yeah i i mean it it it okay light misunderstanding yeah i i thought you but i personally was doing that no i i don't think we're standing in the way but i think that the way the welfare system is set up yes it does kind of foster that kind of an attitude with people whoa when they can just sit around their porches all day and uh still get a check at the end of the week i think that's uh pretty pitiful especially when they're able bodied people yeah and uh you know i sort of i feel a bit guilty about that because uh you know i vote and uh i'm not agitating against it i'm not agitating for it that's for damn sure can i say that on this yeah well the you know the the thing is we get these people in there that are like career politicians and they're grieved by so many people and they're  what do you feel about it uh well let's see um generally i don't think there should be much gun control uh i like to i like to do a lot of hunting and i have my own gun at home and stuff but uh the older i get i think the more i believe there ought to be gun control for instance uh just yesterday i go out my front door and somebody had shot a dog out of their front door their subdivision and the thing kind of wound up right where my kids get picked up at the bus stop oh really that's kind of creepy so uh yeah it is creepy you know and uh you know it makes me think hey you know there's a lot of a there's a lot of nutcases you know living even in you know in your subdivision and i mean yeah well what do you think about like automatic weapons and stuff i mean those can't be used for hunting yeah see yeah you look like look at automatic weapons and things like that and uh you know clearly they have no no useful hunting purpose and uh yeah unless you're really bad yeah even then if you're that bad it probably wouldn't help any anyway just uh it'll help you kill like i mean up in Virginia a lot of hunters get killed anyway just with shotguns you know so i can't imagine what it'd be like if they're doing it with automatic weapons oh really what kind of gun do you use when you hunt uh when i hunt i use a twelve gauge shotgun it's uh actually a lot of heavy broacher so it's kind of a short range kind of thing uh-huh oh really what kind of stuff do you hunt with it uh well i the last time i hunted i hunted turkey actually and uh you know it's oh really i wasn't too successful but i would've shot one if i'd see one so and was that yeah when you use a shot gun do you have to like pick uh the pellets out of the when you're i mean oh yeah well you're supposed and yeah you're supposed to sure you have to try to get it out of there shot but yeah i guess i could you could probably hurt your tooth or something uh well it's actually uh i don't know if this is true anymore but it's lead shot saying that you don't want to oh really you don't want eat a piece of lead but um yeah i think uh you're supposed to do that also you have to be real careful uh about what the animal's been eating you know like uh if you ever hunt pheasant you know sometimes they get into corn that's been uh like you know has mercury on it or something and yeah ugh and uh to keep the because the corn gets treated to keep uh insect dusts away so so if you go in and you dig into the pheasant yeah you can get mercury poison uh-huh but uh so there's i mean there's sort of some risks to that actually uh let me think gun control uh i i generally generally actually since i live so close to DC and since it's the murder capital of the world and you know the anyway yeah Atlanta's not far behind yeah well they have guys i mean i guess they have this Atlanta too but i mean they got guys you know running around you know driving down the street with sub machine guns and stuff and yeah you know i don't even let my wife and uh kids go down there anymore unless you know i'm with them or something and then we just stick strictly to the mall area you know we never never venture outside of that area so yeah well i mean i feel as if nobody you know if there weren't already hand hand so many hand guns and everything prevalent you wouldn't need you know you wouldn't need one for self-defense but it seems like there's so many of them uh that it's really impossible you know it'd be impossible to it'd be impossible to do anyway i mean people would buy them regardless whether it was uh legal or illegal illegal i think yeah doesn't that kind of strike you as especially in big cities that uh you know the law enforcement agencies aren't really capable of of providing the kind of protection that you they should be able to provide no not at all our house as a matter of fact there's some guy that walked in and stole one of my roommate's bikes while he was in the shower just the other day and that's kind of creepy to we live i live right down town and uh if they'd wanted to you know yeah yeah uh-huh coming at or something you know yeah yeah if they wanted to shoot me or something there there wouldn't have been any problem i mean they just it was in broad it was during the day too so obviously they don't have a whole lot of fear of uh yeah yeah being caught by the police in anyway anyway yeah i you know i feel like like you know the when they when they interview these criminals you know the burglars and things they that the two things that they say keep them out of a house best are guns and dogs because they uh-huh yeah we're getting a dog as a yeah so they know there's a dog there they know there's a gun there you know they're probably not going to rob you they'll probably go to the next house uh-huh and uh if they if they suddenly pass a really global law that says you can't have any guns you know there i mean there's guaranteed to be a higher percentage of people just breaking in assuming that these guys don't have any guns and um-hum it's just crazy i've seen the statistics statistics on the number of deaths by hand guns in the United States compared with like Canada and and it's just uh i mean they have like you know a handful a year yeah yeah uh and it's just outrageous how much how many we have here but yeah i don't i don't know if there's anything that can be if gun control would solve that problem yeah contributing maybe contributing factors too nobody nobody knows about yeah i'm i'm usually pretty skeptical on that kind of stuff these studies yeah and besides that i don't think i think the NRA's got such a big lobby that i don't think they'd be able to yeah clearly they have some other motive you know i mean their their argument used to be you know the communist were going to take over or something well they aren't anymore you know so what's the argument now well yeah  well who wants to go first here you you can go ahead well to me capital punishment is uh how should i say it uh i don't think it's it's neither the last thing that it's neither the first uh thing that i would think that needs to be done you know to great length uh how should say it uh not wholesale or something to be shunned at all costs yeah but it is uh something that i think that uh is uh necessary uh under circumstances under many circumstances well i think um i don't think really it should go much for you know rapist or just people who broke into a house nothing like that but i think if someone's killed someone then they deserve to die that's how i see it yeah uh my uh i heard a guy one time who explained it uh in in in kind of a natural way he said uh said just outside of my door there's a there's a hornet's nest and uh that's you're from Atlanta right no Dallas oh excuse me Dallas do they have hornets in Dallas uh they have big bees okay big bees anyway says there's a hornet's nest right outside of his door and he says i i hate to do it but i had to uh to uh to get rid of them and they were just doing what they were supposed to do you know that's what nature equipped them to do and they were doing their thing and but it was pretty threatening to my family so i got rid of them and then he said uh now i have uh he says and that was too bad it's too bad i couldn't relocate it and he said now i have a uh we have somebody who has the will and the ability to be good but instead they choose to be very bad they can destroy any lives and and uh uh and and if not your life your uh yeah mental stability so to speak after they submit you to to uh and he says uh i don't have a lot of feeling for them i have more feeling for the for the hornets than i do for these people that are preying on on uh society yeah so i'm uh let's see the the other question i had i guess was uh i heard one person on the radio say uh where do we get the right to put these people death and or the the corresponding question is where do we get the right to put people in jail at all yeah i think um i think it's kind of sad people who a guy can go out and completely slaughter a family and there's always got to be one person saying that they should have a chance to live and that the person who did the murdering should have a chance to live and i just don't think that's right i think it just makes me want the killer to go after that person's family just one person just to see so that that person will see how the other family felt yeah just so that they'll they can understand all the pain that they're going through and you know then they wouldn't be saying well that killer has a life too because it's not true the as soon as the killer kills someone they they should deserve to die their life is over too i mean they took someone else's life so i don't i just don't think they should deserve to live i think everybody who's ever murdered well i don't know because there's always people who um like fathers who a daughter was raped and they went after the the rapist i think that's kind of a good crime there in my uh you're you're more conservative than some people that i could've talked to but i kind of agree with that uh there's there are people out there who just choose to uh like i said based on my little hornet example they choose to do bad then they because they're human have the ability to um-hum to uh to do immense harm and uh when a person chooses to do that time after time i don't have a lot of uh uh i i just don't feel like they're you know what's there to say uh there are people out there that have made mistakes and they're sorry for it uh i feel bad for them but on the other hand yeah anything in nature that doesn't that doesn't rid itself of of uh decay uh winds up in pretty sad shape and i think that's what we're having now and so we've got some pretty sad sad conditions out there we've got these guys that go out there and and uh do drug uh uh how should i say it wholesale murders um-hum and what that means is that the politicians rather than try and clean up this that nest of uh problems they'll they'll come out to uh to uh people and they'll say what you you have to uh we're going to enact stricter laws on the rest of you yeah you know and and so uh i don't know i i've i've i i guess you can say i'm pretty strongly in favor of capital punishment as long as as long as it's not uh  well uh i guess that was it um i guess the uh it's interesting that they asked the benefits question i think because uh we just merged with another um division in our company and actually have different slightly different benefits so i guess the the things i'd look for um kind of things i call like safety net features like health insurance and uh possibly um retirement pension sorts of incentives and then i guess there's the things for like personal growth like uh educational reimbursement tuition like tuition reimbursement or uh um maybe uh money used for some kind of wellness program like to join a fitness center or something like that would be yeah but be interested in seeing i think it's important to have some place to go over the years in a within a company uh i work for uh um-hum a university but we do defense contracts and with my job there's not much place to go i mean there's not there's not what you're hired in as is what you end up as um and the benefits are okay but i'd rather have more security that's interesting yeah i i was actually at uh Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh doing uh um i guess on research staff there and i i got a feeling that uh you know there wasn't really it wasn't really designed to provide real opportunities for advancement unless you happen to you know like a doctorate in something and then you could you know look at the you'd be eligible for the uh you know the uh are are uh you with with a university system now more important position than yeah you are well well no i'm not i'm sorry i'm at uh i'm actually doing um consulting in the commercial um what in in industry when i say it was a i like security but what we did was a uh mostly radar some um counter stuff for Russians and things so i don't really exactly have a whole lot of security right now well that's interesting since uh they're not doing so good they're not a threat anymore so yeah but it seems like other uh the other people that are on the verge or already have missiles that those kinds of systems would be good at uh you know early detection yeah i'm i'm most all those systems are the same they came were originated Soviet Union so or oh okay so it's not viewed as that's interesting it's not real good you have good good benefits like vacation days does that mean much to you um actually i never thought of that i i i i guess i assumed that's part of the uh package but um i guess if the salary was you know enough then i might just make my own you know take the unpaid time off but uh um as long as you know it's not uh i guess what's more important than vacation is actually having the time to use it because a lot of times we're in projects where you know where the dates are critical and it's it's a little harder to plan a vacation when you're in that kind of environment we have it pretty good because i we we take our vacation anytime we want by the hour by the day um it's good i really like that if it's a pretty day uh if the work's not pressing i go fishing yeah that means a lot to me it it it takes a lot of the stress of the job out too so so like a consistent work load would that be kind of a is that i don't know if that's considered a benefit it's just in kind of part of the environment you're in well we're spaced in timing too uh when we get toward the end of a contract then it's uh you can't leave right and we're always behind time behind schedule out of money you have to donate your time and um we charge you know about four accounting purposes to the projects so there's no way that that you can take off vacation and charge it back to the project yeah huh so they're out of money so i don't know my next job i think i'm going to look at health insurance closer than i did this one interesting yeah it it's only been a problem i guess in our organization seems like um about the year after i joined was when they started passing on a lot higher percentage of the increases they were getting from the carriers but i've got an HMO um um with mine because i've got what what sort of monthly uh uh charges are uh are you uh married do you have family yeah uh one we're growing another um a little boy on the way it looks like all right well what's your monthly for your uh the health insurance so uh uh let's see it's um like thirty dollars a pay period so it's every two weeks so it's about  well i'm not much on colors for every right season i kind of wear whatever i want to wear um uh-huh i uh i buy workout clothes um i'm into fitness a lot and so i i spend money on that that gets kind of expensive do you wear those um Lycra fitness clothes uh-huh one of my house mates has some of those things really uh-huh she seems to like them because they stretch a lot and and give a lot when she rows uh-huh oh did she she rose oh that's interesting um-hum rowing is a real popular fitness activity in here Philadelphia on my goodness well do are you into working out or anything not very much my main focus right now is getting my dissertation finished and so my workouts tend to be limited to going swimming oh right well what kind of clothes do you wear to work or to school to school i generally wear blue jeans and uh depending on the temperature a sweater and then uh a cotton polo shirt um-hum is the weather pretty cold it's been pretty cold lately it's snowing today oh my goodness it it's probably about sixty uh sixty five degrees here it oh i would trade yeah it reached eighty degrees two days ago and i was in shorts and a T-shirt and i went running oh my goodness uh yeah and i had the wrong shoes i've just started running i i been into weigh lifting and all and i just started running and i had the wrong tennis shoes oh now tell me about the tennis shoes for running and how what a difference that makes well um i found out what a difference it makes i just had regular walking shoes that i was running in um-hum and it didn't give me the support i needed i had too much shock and too much jolting on my knees and my ankles and my joints and my lower back do you go running down the sidewalk or down the street oh well um down the sidewalks and uh on the side on the grass the side roads um-hum but um i was running on the track and it's just carpet with uh a little thin thing of padding and then concrete and in those tennis shoes i had Reebok's on and um-hum oh really yeah Reebok walking shoes and they just did not do the job at all so about a week after i started running my shin started hurting i got shin splints so i went to The Athlete a shoe store here in Tyler and tried on several different pairs of shoes i tried Asics and uh Nike Air and uh New Balance and some different type of tennis shoes that are running right um-hum um-hum and uh finally got some Nike Air because they have the the air pockets in the front and the back right and i didn't think that it would make any difference you know i thought well that's just a sales pitch you know and Nike's real expensive because they're always putting out new things and you just pay for the brand right right but i tried on i compared the way that felt to all the other brands and the prices difference difference wasn't that much you know maybe ten dollars difference right and so i finally bought some Nike Air Skylon 2 and so it it they just are wonderful it it i can run further now because i'm not in pain uh-huh uh-huh right now my housemate's boyfriend just got he's training for a marathon and he just got some uh-huh some Nike Air shoes and he says that you can also run a lot further in those because you save a lot of more energy oh uh-huh sure my shoes i just got some new ones my old ones had blown out and my new ones are Reebok basketball shoes uh-huh uh-huh i picked them out mainly because they were on a big sale uh-huh my shoes are blue so the uh oh the blue shoes the green shoes and the red shoes were about about fifteen dollars or a little bit more than fifteen dollars less than the white shoes oh so i went ahead and got a blue pair of sneaks oh well that's good so at my house one of my old housemate's i was just was watching her give a talk over at the business college yesterday she's um looking for a permanent job right now but she uh-huh um was talking about loss aversion which is when you hate to give something up uh-huh that you already have so uh-huh somebody like you that's used to having good quality sneaks would really hate to give up um good quality sneaks for a better price but somebody like me who's not used to having good quality sneaks would hate to pay more for better quality sneaks uh-huh right well now when it comes to clothing like above the ankles  so uh what do you wear to work uh well uh traditionally i wear a pair of blue jeans and a dress shirt all right uh and and uh uh leather shoes it's pretty casual yeah well that's good where do you work uh at the for the Navy i work in uh research right right NTSC huh i used to work in that building right right before i worked at Honeywell i worked at ARI which is on the PM trade side uh-huh right right all right imagine that there's all kinds of uh coincidences here um yeah that's that's a pretty good environment actually when i worked for ARI they made me wear uh well they didn't make make wear anything but they prefer that i wore something almost tieish yeah real close there yes it's uh it depends upon the interaction you have with the outside world and i have several suits that if i'm going to interact with the outside world or with upper management that i will dress accordingly right right okay but for day to day work uh it's pretty casual all right what kind of research do you do Kyle uh flight simulation get out are you kidding me nope yeah that's what i do i'm uh i'm working with flight controls and displays up here at Honeywell um in fact my dissertation will involve uh auditory warnings well that's interesting eye cast things like that so uh yeah it's amazing uh-huh um no up here at Honeywell we generally it's real real laid back in terms of dress uh most people have never seen a tie i don't think unless they're meeting with a with a customer right i should've remembered that the last time i was up there yeah and oh you were up at oh that's right you said you'd spend some time up here at Honeywell yeah i went up there it's been four uh about three four years now do you remember which department or which branch you were at uh probably not huh uh Minneapolis whoever makes the okay yeah i'm not real sure about that i've only been up here a little while so i'm still kind of getting the hang of it but actually i'll be back down in May to finish my degree so uh that'll be good hum do you have much connection with the human factors people down there uh in fact yes i do uh as soon as i get out of some work i'm doing right now i'll be talking to them uh uh and getting some low cost uh uh equipment together to do some uh human factor studies yeah all right great well i'll probably be using some of it i hope when i get back give me a good vehicle to do my dissertation on maybe but uh yeah actually that it's and all those people right i'll be working with uh uh Carolyn Carolyn Prince oh okay right great but uh no aside from that i don't think i've worn a tie more than about once here and that's uh well it's pretty casual here yes they kind of had to twist my arm to do that because i wasn't meeting with a customer but you know how that works um-hum but uh oh the jeans are new i mean it's not like they're they're bleached out or well yeah it sounds like you got all holes over the place now the guys that no no no the guys that i'm working with here the guy that i work directly with uh in my office he usually comes in in real ripped jeans he's pretty uh real casual in fact almost too casual i'm not quite that bad plus uh yeah i was kind of surprised to see that actually hum so uh where else did you work before that i've been i've been working here for the center for uh uh nine years nine plus years now yeah all right you like it yeah it has it's it's it's you know it had it's had its good times and bad times but for the most part yeah i think it's pretty good yeah i i liked it too it it's kind of weird that that environment is is different than a lot of other environments just because you're in in a little maze of cubicles you know and it's kind of it's just yeah it's kind of like being in a rat trap yeah it is in a way and and i keep on wondering where the cheese is presumably that's supposed to be the paycheck right but who's to say well that's awfully small cheese if you ask me then yeah no kidding but uh now that the whole idea of them pumping white noise over the speakers to mask out the telephones and things like that it's kind of interesting yeah there was a lot of uh thought put into that because i i i because when i go to other new facilities whether it be uh uh uh uh McDonald Douglas some of the other new facilities i've been to there's yeah and little things that they point out to me when i was walking around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that so they're actually kind of thinking it through huh yeah oh well the architect tries to throw it in but uh sometimes i wonder when they put back the people that's supposed to be monitoring the building right uh how much reins they got but they give them an award well that's i guess that's the important part for them but uh so what do you uh do you think you're going to stick around there for a while or do think uh yeah yeah there's there's uh prospect job prospects with another company that i should know uh more we've been talking back and forth for about a year and a half now yeah yeah i've actually i'm actually kind of looking for work when i get back  um at what age did your father enter the nursing home um he was around seventy nine i believe gosh and um but it's a big decision to make but um you know people say because one day they're they look like they're doing real well and the next they're just you know awful in diapers and the whole bit right and um uh they can be mentally sane one day and just look perfectly normal and then the next day they're just are weeks off of off of it and until you take care of a person personally there were three my mom and i and our kids would help us some and it was just awful to take care of a person that is that way i tell you i worked in home health care with the elderly um for a while and uh while i was in college and it was a very i mean i enjoyed my job but i i worked a uh uh very strenuous yes three days on and four days off is what my schedule was and um-hum um-hum and um i'm a compassionate person and uh physically strong but when i got off my three day shift i mean you know you couldn't have kept me there another minute i just had to go um-hum right yes but i don't know how the the uh people at the nursing homes handle it day in and day out truthfully because of the physical strain uh as well as uh you know emotionally well they they have to build walls emotionally but it um-hum i i think that's almost necessary i and it's interesting that compassion has got to be a required quality but then they yet they have to have the ability to isolate themselves from too much too much compassion yeah oh yeah um-hum from the situation um-hum um was very difficult for me at times as the as the daughter to you know to a special person i could imagine oh of course uh uh but anyway anyway he he um the the requirements for the nursing home were first of all well of course the cleanliness and the care you know what type of care do they need it depends if you you know if you need the bed total bed care um-hum or if he could if they could be up and around it all depends on the type of nursing home they have the ones where they live in apartments even and just get their meals and care there you know that way so that that's one of the i mean it just depends on the patients that's true and i think it would be i would think it would be helpful to the patient to um be housed with uh patients with similar uh had you know similar problems right right if you will you know excuse the word just so that they could relate to one another and and wouldn't you know be um-hum except bless their hearts they're usually so senile they don't really do anything love each other and and all they do is fight with each other that was i found in my father you know all those old people would just fight with you it was a riot i know i i tell you i was at an uh convalescent home last week um a three hundred and twenty five patient convalescent home um-hum and i could not believe how feisty these people were i had never i had never been in a group atmosphere when i was in home health care it was a one-on-one ratio uh-huh um-hum and these folks were you know about to go to the mat over TV stations that they had chosen or uh arguing over whether or not their meals were cooked enough and and as if the another patient could have done something about it right right right and i find that psychologically very interesting because i i feel from my perspective that it would be a a manifestation of their own frustration yeah and uh i'm going to ignore that click if you heard it uh oh that's fine yeah and and that um would would i don't know that that frustration would be preventable in even in the one-on-one ratio i worked in my patients were very frustrated and very upset uh-huh it is for them bless their hearts it is very frustrating but but by the same token it's it's the one my father was in was wonderful care oh that i'm sure that was a load off your mind and uh yeah it is and uh just knowing they're daily taken care of as far as uh physically and uh you know they they kept him clean and they kept him and uh kept up with his medicine and all it's a big thing um-hum what um do they did you find um that they offered sufficient dietary maintenance that would be something i would it was pretty good it was nothing to write home about it's typical you know it's typical um would uh oh what do you want to say you know um commercial you know and uh it was it was fine they had but they had a recreation director that was pretty good there and she made sure they had their little get togethers and parties most everyday she had something going on for them um-hum either ceramics or they did ceramics which i never thought my dad would do but he did a little bit of it  did you attend public school i did attend public school for all but one year i uh went to a Catholic school for one year found that uh it did not agree with me or i did not agree agree with it and uh spent the rest of my education in public schools uh-huh uh-huh uh i had mixed feelings on it uh because i thought that there was a greater range of students that a public school has to uh has to address yes that's true they can't root out the troublemakers as easily right and and the the programs have to be wider uh when i went to the Catholic high school uh there was nothing but a college preparatory course okay and in the public school there were uh a couple of different courses the uh the the so-called business course uh the college prep course and then there was the uh the uh the the basic uh gas station manager track uh you know yeah i never yeah yes vocational education we called it right and i'm not sure that uh the college prep course was any worse in a public school than it would've been in a private school uh-huh but i think that the teachers were spread a little more thin because they weren't always able to focus on the areas that they taught best uh-huh uh-huh and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or well a little bit of both uh the school wasn't very crowded when i went there although it's since gotten it's since gotten worse but uh there were uh-huh um-hum there were some very good math teachers there there was one uh a science teacher in particular there who ended up having to teach a i i can't remember what course it was but it was really unsuitable uh it was some sort of uh um shop or mechanical drawing class and he just oh uh-huh he know he didn't know much about it but they figured he was a warm body in a room uh-huh that's kind of technical so he could him it was him yeah right right and i don't think that uh i don't i don't think that there are the resources in most public schools to be able to say well what we need here is a trained machinist to teach teach the metal shop course let's go find one they just say well you know we have this course we need a body for it um-hum uh-huh were already paying this guy right yeah yeah uh did you go to a public school i did i did and uh i felt i got a very i mean i feel i got a very poor education in general uh um-hum but i think that i knew other people from other public schools who got better educations um uh in our case it think it was you know the teachers uh again spread thin but maybe in terms of just having too many student to really do the job um i'm sort of i have a two year old son now and so i'm starting to think about um-hum education you know more critically and trying to figure out what we want to do and i'm just sort of turned off by the whole uh the whole system where everyone sits facing the front of the room as quiet as possible while the teacher lectures uh especially for small children um-hum sure uh it just seems like it's not the way they're going to learn best but when you have one teacher and thirty students what else can you do right you know i mean it seems like the the style of teaching that we we have grown to think of as normal i think is dictated by economics in just in terms of uh student teacher ratios um um-hum so have you started looking into uh alternative schools like Montessories um no so far i'm just whining i haven't done anything constructive yet uh we fantasize about homeschooling uh-huh um-hum but uh we probably won't right although i could see where that would be that could be a lot of fun i can see a lot of advantages to homeschooling but uh there's it's it's interesting there's uh someone here in Rhode Island who is very disgusted with the school system  do you listen to TV mostly or radio or newspaper well for myself it's the printed media um only on occasion do i i watch the television for any news because by that time it's so glossed over it's not even funny um-hum um the radio i've yet to find but it's also little sound bites on TV they don't really tell you much so true so true except except for giving you sports and weather and telling you the story is going to be coming just after this commercial yeah that's right you know details at eleven while the earth is cracking in half yes yes you know um but myself i go for the printed media and well one one new show which i do watch on occasion is McNeal Lehrer on public television yeah and that's because they can take the time to get into the new story and they don't go for the hype and all that stuff it appears to me that the news media for the most part is uh doing its darndest to appeal to the lowest common denominator and um-hum have you ever picked up a copy of uh USA Today oh buddy news McNuggets oh yeah there you go so true so true no personally i listen to radio mostly hit the NPR in the morning and in the evening coming home yeah yeah i always liked all things considered yeah All All Things Considered and uh morning edition um-hum and it's like you know just have that on in the morning while i'm going through the normal routine or driving home at night yeah yeah same story here i uh happened to cross that that beauty of a of a station when uh i was with a new car and all i had was an AM radio and i cursed the time for a while and then i found that and i didn't want to go back to FM um-hum yeah yeah but uh well out here we get it uh both AM and FM oh you lucky dogs we get it out of the though though the FM cuts off at eight A M and then you have to switch over to AM if you want to continue listening to the news oh well you get it one way you get it another yeah yeah but myself well like for example with this you know the democratic race we got going here the different candidates we got all this other stuff all i'm seeing are a couple of yahoos and uh no issues so to speak oh yeah yeah definitely definitely haven't been any issues and ninety percent of the stories you hear yeah even you know you know i i we got the AP news wire at work which is also a very good source of news ah and most of the stories there are how well each candidate did in which place and where they and you know what's the latest scandal but nothing about what they stand for and yeah oh yeah i mean heard more i heard more about Jennifer Flowers than i heard i have heard Bill Clinton's uh platform on health care issues or yeah yeah and George Bush forget it oh yeah thank you he doesn't have a platform yeah that's right well as i always like to say back when he was talking about a thousand points of light that's a nice way of saying our platform is full of holes no no that's a thousand pointless lies hey there you go i'll make that into a tag line in my system all right oh goodness but i don't know for the most part i see the media for the most part pandering like i said to the lowest common denominator because when it gets down to the nitty-gritty and the brass tacks it gets real unpopular well it it and it looses advertisers and it looses starts hurting in the budget so it has to cater somewhere yeah yeah news news is entertainment yeah infotainment no not even infotainment entertainment yeah i mean the largest segments are sports and weather yeah that's true and there's there's not really that much of what's going on and the only stories that really get talked about are the ones that have good video clips to go with them um-hum yeah and it's been a long time since i've seen any you know source of the media do anything gutsy we had a situation here in Des Moines when um it was right after Jeffrey Dahlmer had been apprehended yeah that um the animal rights groups ran an ad which excepted which depicted the of animals very much akin to the uh victims of Jeffrey Dahlmer uh-huh well the register ran it which i think was the right role and privilege and i would be packing pulled out a quarter of a million in advertising yes um-hum you know socked it right to them and that's i guess uh something that distresses me when they have to cater to all these different special interest groups we're not going to get the news well that's one nice nice thing about the public radio and public television is for the most part they're some what distanced from that but yeah well unfortunately not completely these days since that's where a lot of their funding is coming from is corporate underwriting yeah and that's unfortunate but they at least make the effort to be distance themselves from that yeah they they've got to work harder because right now when you challenge funding for public radio or public television you're no longer being typecast as trying to kill big bird um-hum you know they're uh i  in the evening back there now isn't it pardon what time is it back there right now it's uh about seven thirty oh okay yeah so have you been golfing yet this year uh no actually i'm uh quite a beginner i'm very green i just got my first set of clubs this year for Christmas but i have uh gone out to the driving range once or twice uh-huh to uh see if i can work on my swing a little bit oh good yeah i'm not that much i've gone about i guess about twenty twenty five times yeah no i'm not a beginner but i'm not a novice either little bit more experience though yeah yeah it takes quite a bit i used to go just about every day during this one summer and i did really good and then the more i practiced the worse i got really so i got frustrated but i heard that happens to everyone now how how much out of the year or how long out of the year can you play where you live um we couldn't start playing right now there's a few courses open uh-huh um pretty much until end of probably October and if it snows or not oh that's not bad uh-huh so it is a quite a long season i would have thought that uh this time of the year here i might be able to get out a little bit but uh Winter seems to be dragging on up here and we have snow right now oh but uh i noticed a lot of the driving ranges outdoor driving ranges do um if if you want to play outside in the cold you can you can sweep the snow off the uh tees and and play from there but we also have a lot of indoor driving ranges and and that's a little bit strange getting used to swinging the club inside and and uh hitting the ball into a net instead of letting it fly yeah because you don't know for sure can you tell if you're slice much on those um i can tell i can because i slice so terribly bad i'm still trying to work on that uh-huh but uh i don't know i've noticed that it's mostly the real beginners like myself that that will do that it seems like the real experienced people'll wait um until they can play outside and really hit the ball uh-huh do you use your own balls on those on the net i i'm sorry using own balls my own balls yeah when you hit against a net and indoor you can get a bucket of balls like you would on an outdoor we're going to try something new we haven't done this yet a a few of us are going to go to a place where they have big uh video screens oh they okay provide and they advertise courses like Pebble Beach and a few others yeah i played that once Pebble Beach i played did you do that once oh really the real Pebble Beach um no no i wish the the screen one yeah oh okay you did that so that must be fairly common yeah well they were trying it out here is i did it about gee six or seven years ago uh-huh and so i don't how much more advanced they got when i tried it it was all right was it is it like fairly realistic or yeah maybe they improved on that because when i did it it was all right but it wasn't that impressive no well we haven't done it yet but uh it it sounds like fun and it looked like fun so we figure we'd just go do it once to see what it's like yeah i kind of experienced it once but i'm getting kind of antsy to to really polish my stroke up a little bit more my father-in-law's a real avid golfer he plays six days a week three hundred and sixty five days out of the year oh really retired yeah yeah he's retired and living out on the west coast where it's warm enough that he can play outside all year round you imagine doing that no i don't think i can it's funny because he uh his his knees are shot from uh he was a surgeon and his knees are shot from being on his feet all day everyday oh really and uh he has artificial knees he doesn't get around to well but he still plays eighteen holes of golf everyday wow i didn't know that would hurt hurt hurt you standing all the time evidently yeah so he uh i don't know he's got his own little golf cart that he putts over to the country club in and huh and he gets around okay in fact i did go out with him when we were out there for Christmas and went right after i got my clubs i did go out with him once and we uh knocked the ball right it was pretty dull for him seeing how i had to hit it about twenty times before i got onto the green that's why i've never chored so much in my life until i went golfing yeah uh do you you belong to a club or anything no it's just just once in but i'll probably go about three or four times during the summer i don't even have my own clubs yeah i usually get a hold of someone that lets me use them i really enjoy the game well i'm left handed and i found that i couldn't always get a hold of good left handed clubs or any left handed clubs whatsoever really oh yeah and i did try it once i'm hopeless i'm not even i can't do anything with my right hand but i did try using right handed clubs once and it it was so awkward for me so i i figured it it might be a good investment i i better be sure and serious about getting into it or else the uh the investment isn't very good uh-huh has your wife golfed um a little bit here and there not a whole lot she's uh she used to play more but um her shoulders started bothering her  served on jury duty but it's ironic because i have a summons here for the thirtieth which is the Monday after next and i'll be a little more authoritative on this after then um i haven't either but here recently i with with the advent of court TV i've watched a little bit more than but um uh than i would have a probably a year or so ago so i i've been getting a little more interested in court procedures too um yeah i would think that um sentencing would be the kind of thing that an expert system would be ideal for you know there's a whole bunch of evidence that's supposed to be weighed and for nice uniform sentencing for particular things it would um seem like the perfect solution but i suppose that would be really subject to abuse as well well uh i guess it could be but i i i agree with you in that to the extent that i i think it it largely would be more uniform i think uh as a opposed to a a real mixture of juries with in different locations and different you know ideas yeah there's so much variation in sentencing like this guy recently that um there was some guy that was convicted and he volunteered to be castrated i guess that was down in your area uh yeah uh i think it was yeah Houston i've been hearing about that yeah and then here they've gone and um no surgeon could be found to perform the job so the judge went and withdrew the whole idea or something like that yeah plus he was getting a lot of uh uh criticisms i guess for by different groups you know about just being inhumane you know that sort of thing yeah one thing i would certainly like to see is that um criminals be sentenced to some sort of a uh a means of paying for their um incarceration i think that's that's reasonable those of us on this side of uh the justice system have to pay pay our way through life yeah and and the costs are real high i guess of both uh of of keeping someone in prison and going through the trial procedure the whole whole works uh yeah absolutely and and that just comes out of the tax money and uh in a lot of cases the uh uh the person being tried sometimes you know they do have the means to uh to repay the courts or the victims or the prisons to uh to keep them really or to perform some sort of more work than is is currently done in most prisons yeah i would think there's a lot that a lot of production that could could be done um you know with people like that whether totally unskilled or not yeah yeah they need to make some adjustments on that um uh the the other question i guess that that to be addressed is uh whether uh a a verdict should should require unanimous uh uh decision that's a tough one we seem to as a group have such a hard time all agreeing and what is it they say about democracy the flaws of democracy is that nobody will um agree on anything or it's hard to get everybody to agree on something i can't there's some saying i can't remember what it is yeah it yeah i i i don't know but it seems like um everything is so stacked and in favor of the criminal that it's a shame to have a a majority that would vote uh guilty and to have just one dissenting vote could jeopardize the whole uh whole process or whole whole verdict to yeah really that's a really good point and it seems like it should just be uh some come up with some sort of majority maybe um uh maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because it's it's hard to get every single person to to agree on anything like you say how is it now do you know do they have it so that if um some certain percentage agrees then or well it has to right now it has to be unanimous on most of those decisions if not it's a hung jury and uh they're asked to stay in and try to come up with the unanimous verdict and then if eventually it's uh uh not unanimous even by one vote it's sometimes i i think it's either thrown out or they have to go for retrial hum um even if just one person is is holding out or can't be convinced to uh to vote guilty more time and expense yeah i mean that's really a really really really a lot of cost to uh to bring that to trial again very interesting yeah there seems to be a lot of problems with the uh criminal justice system in America today i'm certainly no one to have the answers yeah they it needs some some revising and i heard that this is a little unrelated i guess but i heard uh what was it the other day it said to for someone who's convicted and put on death row it was it it was up in the millions what it costs to keep that person and then to execute that person at the time you you you know it usually takes years to do that hum unbelievably i just all the appeals processes that goes on and yeah and they're all automatic too for a long ways at least yeah and that was just uh amazing that they were talking about a millions of dollars per  okay well two things that come to mind with me first um is one i think more emphasis should placed on the the English and and some of the basics i mean we we can get so specialized into you know extracurricular activities that we've got kids graduating high school that don't know how to read and write and such like that oh yeah there seems to be a little bit of bias towards extracurricular stuff even all the way up through college um-hum gets really out of hand i'll agree with you on that one yes it does uh you said two things well the other one is i think we i think we need to do a little bit more to keep kids in school uh yeah i agree with you on that i happen to think the school system's pretty good yes and that uh the problem lies in uh teaching the kids to care and you know raising them up to care i'm not sure how to do that yeah i think uh you know the i mean the obvious examples are kids from broken families or families where the parents really don't care but but i know that a lot most parents do care and you know there's still problems um-hum i'm not sure what the answer there is yeah well i think i mean i think but overall we've got a really good system it's just we crowd a lot of kids a lot of kids in with one teacher and i know i i know i'm in a i'm i'm in college right now and um we have real small classes we we're very fortunate in that we do and which is good because i mean the the people that i'm in class with we all learn different ways um-hum and this way um i know my teacher real well and we can work on how i learn best so you like a sort of a one-on-one situation with the teacher well not so much a one-on-one but you know like a ten or a fifteen on one as compared as compared to thirty and such yeah when i when i was in high school and grade school uh-huh i noticed the classes that i got the most out of were the ones where there were a few at least you know a few other students who were interested um-hum so there'd be a lively discussion in the class yeah if if no one cared you know it didn't matter if the teacher was exciting or not it'd be he'd be talking he or she'd be talking at you um-hum um-hum and uh and if the teacher was an idiot which did happen yes if the other kids were into it you know you could have a lot of fun uh with the material anyway yeah that's true so to me i i i'm i'm going to back and say it's the students have got to be looking to learn uh they've got to be curious and i think that's something that the the school system really doesn't address at all um-hum i mean that there's a few interesting good classes were uh you know a teacher will come and really interest a kid but most of them you know it's pretty much up to the kids to carry it through yeah to to be interested and you know you talk to yeah you talk to people on the street and they don't know history they don't know geography and it doesn't bother them they they really don't care it's not important to them um-hum um-hum for some reason i mean it's it's not that they're stupid because they're not these things that i feel are important to living in the world are not important to them um-hum but still you know your basic your basic English your reading and your writing and you know and some of your math you know are very essential yeah and people don't know this because they don't feel that it's important you know right though that's what okay i i editorialized i'm sorry no that's okay i it seems to me that they don't feel it's important and that's why they don't know English um-hum i i've run into a couple of those yeah yeah i don't know i i think it's i mean i've heard some some some school districts that have that have uh found some really unique ways about getting around the problems and you know of even though we've got a really good system the problems of you know as far comparing right now they're real big into comparing our stats with that of other countries have you seen that uh yeah we're uh falling further and further behind the cutting edge apparently um-hum um-hum uh what are these interesting programs you mentioned well um i have i've just heard briefly about one  yeah Jim uh so uh how many children do you have and what are their ages uh we have two they're going to be two and four years old in April uh-huh and that's after uh twenty one years of marriage so so we we've had quite an experience over the last four years of readjusting our time in terms of spending with the kids how about yourself Frank oh is that right wow i imagine we have uh four children but they're all grown and out of the house now but we still uh spend a a lot of time together really it's a it's a close family uh we have one daughter that's going to college uh in Boston and uh we don't see uh you know an awful lot of her every couple of weeks uh we manage to get together maybe three weeks um-hum and i've got uh one son that lives uh about ten miles north of us and a couple other sons that live uh about an hour away a piece they they live in the same basically in the same area about an hour away from us um-hum but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh we're together with one of the you know one of the kids sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh couple of months um-hum so it's kind of a different situation are you do you have a boy and a girl two boys two girls two girls yeah yeah and my wife and i are both from Saint Louis and we've been in New Jersey now for uh eleven years two girls uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so we've been away for a long time and when it was just the two of us we'd go back about every year but now that we have the two girls we try to get back twice a year uh-huh because we both grew up with uh family all around us and weekend with the cousins and uh both of our families have uh we have siblings that have lots of children so um-hum we miss that environment but and i think partly because of that because our family's a thousand miles away uh-huh we might even overcompensate um-hum we uh pretty much uh between between that thousand mile distance from uh relatives and the fact that we had uh uh eighteen years together um-hum married life uh before our daughters were born and uh we we pretty much it it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls i mean from waking until uh till night time we we literally have an hour and a half to ourselves every night i i know what you no uh does your wife work or not no she stays at home uh and okay that's good uh my son uh one of my sons i should say that uh had been married for nine years just had a a uh daughter uh back in July last July and you know they were getting pretty set in their ways after nine years and uh it was quite a readjustment for them so i imagine after uh eighteen years it really was a a a an adjustment in your lives um-hum it wasn't it wasn't um uh partly because we had all that time together we're ready to focus on a family so and of uh course the changing economy you know helps focus on the the home life also um-hum um-hum um i mean our lifestyle changed drastically we went from two incomes and no children so we had Caribbean vacations and new cars and expensive cars down to um right one income two children and uh the total uncertainty of the job market now so we we pretty much stay at home right uh-huh focus we we do have our older daughter in a preschool a Montessori and that's quite expensive and uh-huh in fact my wife just joined the uh was just elected last night to the board of the school uh-huh so she's spending quite a bit of time in fact she's on the other line right now doing school board talk oh is that right huh so it it seems like even our leisure time it's been focused more centered around the kids what do what do you find is the trend amongst families in your observation for how they spend their time together what activities they're doing and how they spend the time do you think they have more or less or what uh it seems to me uh that families are spending more fractional time together um-hum that maybe one parent will go off with one child and another parent will go off with the other children um-hum um rather than and focusing more on the children's activities rather than family activities and uh-huh i think with so with so many parents working both husband and wife that it's difficult to find time for everybody to be together yes and partly because of that working phenomena then the kids end up getting their lives scheduled with ballet and football and soccer i mean we we live in an area that uh soccer and football is just taking off phenomenally um-hum uh we we have terrible problems with scheduling soccer fields and finding enough land to even to build new football fields that they need right and part of that phenomena is the dual working household and i think uh-huh rather than spending the time in the evening with family activities  um like i say i'm a i'm a uh a sort of an addict for uh current events and news so i read the paper almost everyday and um i also generally watch one of the national news casts yeah i keep up with most of my stuff either by the news i don't get to read the paper everyday because i just don't have enough time but i read it on Sundays and then i always listen to the like six o'clock or ten o'clock news and then listen to the radio uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news um-hum so i'm i'm really not very happy with local news cast and i'm uh i don't like the local paper paper very much either well especially since we don't have a choice anymore since Dallas lost its one paper that i that's true um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh i'm finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because the selection is so bad yeah what about USA Today do you read that one no uh i used to nope uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper that's what i grew up with but uh i don't spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to it's not worth it uh let it pile up i like um USA Today yeah because i mean it's not real thick but it gets most of the stuff in there that's current and going on does it have editorial writers um yeah who are some of them now that got got me i mean i don't read it everyday like whenever we're on vacation or whenever i go on vacation or whatever i i get to keep up with it but that's like what once or twice a year can you i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate i think well i mean i don't know you know i really have never paid that much attention to that that's that's what the Dallas Morning News does and they they they seem to select select them kind of irregularly and i um i don't think they do a very good job myself yeah do you read the paper everyday pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news that's the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news yeah but um i i'm finding that McNeal Lehrer uh news hour is the TV program that i i like to watch the most they because they they don't give you these thirty seconds short shots of twenty different stories they usually spend about fifteen minutes or ten minutes on the story oh really yeah now um when does that come on ten o'clock well it's actually it's on a couple of times it's on channel two at seven i think and it's on channel thirteen at uh ten o'clock usually yeah so i try to watch that from ten to eleven unless unless something else is going on the radio station that i listen to in the morning i mean they're they're real good about going over like what's going and i mean they talk about it like some of this like the major events that are going on you ever listen to the public radio station um no no well i mean i may've just flipped through it why KERA they're quite yeah they're quite good uh yeah i like them very much oh really that's that's what i tune to regularly um KRLD if i need to know what the traffic's like yeah so no the Eagle usually i mean they'll can tell you pretty much they go over the stuff they have a newscaster on there and they go i mean it's short and sweet but i mean they keep you up to date on stuff you spend a lot of time driving yeah well yeah well i mean i always listen to the radio or the TV whenever i'm getting ready in the morning yeah yeah i'm always listening to the news um when i drive but i don't drive i mean i my commute is only about five minutes so i i don't have to uh spend a lot of time in the car if i did i guess i would rely more on the radio more than i do on the TV see you have a shorter commute so that's why you get to stay home and read the paper in the morning me i just have to rely on the TV or the um the newspaper i mean the or the right right yeah radio station yeah i i find that most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so that's one one reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth yeah well i used to work i worked for a newspaper for six and a half years they did where uh in well in Nacogdoches Texas which is real small town oh uh-huh i know where it is yeah uh-huh and oh really well um it was family owned and everything so we didn't like the the way a lot of the stuff was run there was it a weekly daily um-hum daily oh i wouldn't think a size town that size would have a daily newspaper yep huh but they got bought out by Cox uh-huh so now a lot of things have changed or whatever is it still a daily yep yeah is that where you grew up yes actually uh-huh uh-huh well that's surprising surprising there was a a daily newspaper at a town that small yeah like i said it was family owned and they pretty much i mean they were in the i mean well they put in there what they published what they wanted to publish and stuff they didn't want to publish yeah  a loaded question what do you think about gun control Rick well as a person living in one of the areas that's got both the uh one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the uh highest murder rates in the uh country uh-huh um i happen to be an opponent of gun control well that's interesting i happen to be um kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um changes too i formerly was one of your typical New York left wingers that you know that's what i suspected and um talking to a New Yorker i thought that i'd hear someone who was totally for gun control uh-huh well we're not all like that um about a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license oh my and um not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together yeah i used to do a lot of that it it can be a lot of fun all right where you are you can go to Sears right uh yeah i think so really yeah i'm not i'm i'm not sure about Sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know Sears used to sell guns i just i'm aggravated with Sears right now yeah yeah you know the stores the stores are here but it's you know you walk in and i'd like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork uh it's kind of funny because um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign bet but uh yeah i may get a chance to try out some things i've never tried out before yeah yeah well i grew up in New Mexico and you know guns were a fact of life ah um-hum uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh uh that you've gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns yeah uh for rifle and shotgun you've got to sign the federal form but that's about it i see um and i really don't know where they stand on semiautomatics these days yeah uh they've been getting a lot of bad press yeah um it's uh well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that uh i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people sounds fair um my ex-husband would choke if he heard me say that uh-huh well you know it um you know it's kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about a year and a half ago of murders here four within the space of about two months and the profile of all of them was a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his ex-wife um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didn't get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman oh and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um you know there are you know that maybe just maybe she could've uh had a better shot at it if um she'd been armed literally yeah you know at uh and in all those cases were those murders by guns probably um i don't think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i don't know the specifics but um you know it uh what was that oh my wife is screaming shotgun oh either go get it or uh or what um what do you call we had uh friend of mine who would maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime and uh you know that's something we all actually except that is the purpose of the police and i said what do you mean by that and his comment was well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they can't be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime right they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they can't be good at preventing it uh-huh so if the police aren't going to prevent it who is i see and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and it's absolutely true you know it you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is yeah you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was screaming his his car had been stolen and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him we're spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before they'd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter you know a matter of priorities i guess yeah yeah i can understand that yeah but um uh are you a member of the NRA as a matter of fact are you recently yeah card carrying um it's about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time is that right and um my ex was a long term member of the NRA yeah yeah it's interesting of course one of the things that um yeah i i don't know  Jonathan um it seems to me that most people rather make a decision between going all out particularly males go all out on the career or they go or they spend some real quality time with their kids when their when their kids are still young and and are willing to spend time with the parents what do you think about that um-hum uh yeah that's an interesting point i work in uh the computer business which tends to be pretty high pressure and time consuming and i work with a lot of guys who are just now having first and second kids and it's interesting to see how they handle it because in a lot of cases they're still trying to put in the hours but they're also trying to spend a lot of time at home and in many cases they've got spouses who work so it's it's an interesting juggling pattern i my impression is that people try to uh to do both if they can as tough as that is do you think it's possible uh boy that's a good question i've my kids are eight and a half and six now and i've been working in this business you know while they were growing up and you know it's it's tough uh there have been plenty of times where i've had to work long hours so that you know during a particular week i might not see them as much as i wanted to um-hum but i i do sense that people's expectations today are often different than they were maybe in my parent's generation where you know child raising was kind of seen as the the woman's responsibility and if the man had to work extra long hours or travel you know that's just the way it was i think today men have somewhat different expectations when they try to tailor their schedules as much as they can i got uh my office mate um he he got divorced and and uh he was talking about that the thing that he was gladdest about in in the relationship that he was in before that uh he spent like a lot more time than the average father with his kid i mean he took his kids out um ice skating and water skiing and and i mean just if there was something that that he could think of to do with them he went out and did it uh-huh and now now that he's he's no longer the the wife has custody of the kids he still has a good relationship with the kids uh-huh which you know a lot of people even in marriages that stay together try to all of the sudden get to know their kids when they turn eighteen or something like that sure but but i think i think he did the right thing is is making sure that the kids really i mean they might get mad as heck at at at the parents but making sure that the kids know from you know one two three that that there's no one that loves them as much as uh as dad and mom you know yeah i think there's a lot to that you you really have to establish the relationship early on yeah certainly read a lot or heard a lot of stories about people who grow up saying i felt i never really knew my father yeah and i you know it's it's hard to say i don't travel in a wide social circle but it's my impression that a lot of people today a lot of men are are trying to change anyway i think it has been changing over the generations you know i see my granddad now and and it's really it's really way too late i i mean my granddad grew up in the military you know he was always the never show your feelings but it seems like he tries real hard now to to try let his sons know that that he loves them and it's um i mean to some extent it's too late my dad i'm sorry go ahead yeah yeah i was just saying yeah yeah my dad um i always knew that my dad loved me he but he never really said it until uh um oh i don't know i think i was in college the first time i actually heard him say it but uh i always knew it i mean he always he always did things so that i knew it but i think i i mean granted it's easy to say i don't have kids but uh i i i think that's one of the things i really want to make sure that i do a lot is is say it as many times as as just so that they get oh you know come on dad stop that but you know i mean you know i don't know yeah actually i've heard a lot of that from uh my son who you know goes through periods were he's particularly attached to mom and when i say i love you you know he says i hate you and things like that not just kidding around not really meaning it but you know not as comfortable with uh an overt display of affection from me anyway uh-huh um what kind of stuff do you do with them uh try to uh plan outings to museum say take them to playgrounds you know baseball in the back yard that kind of thing a lot of times following his lead he's currently obsessed with Legos i mean he he  all right so what do you think about gun control or what how do you rate on a one to ten scale your feelings about gun control well i guess i'd probably put myself on about a five i'm kind of in the middle on that i think that there's uh there are some guns that i just can't think of any reason why anybody would want to have them unless they just want to go shoot somebody um-hum but on the other hand i think there's a lot of legitimate use for guns too and i don't see any reason why we should do any sort of control or uh certainly no sort of you know serious restrictions on those for example hunting and things like that and even some self-defense things so how do you feel about it i'd probably be closer to uh on the one side okay i don't really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets produced you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house um-hum that's about the only good that ever comes from it i don't know i know some people who hunt and uh you know well i yeah you could i mean but do they necessarily have to keep them at home to do that uh i mean maybe there's a way they can be uh maintained in a a certain location i don't know but i don't know if individual ownership is necessary um-hum yeah well it seems like most of the people who get hurt from them get hurt from handguns um-hum and so i look at somebody like you know who's got a you know maybe a a twenty two caliber rifle or something like that if you know good for for you know maybe hunting some small you know animal or something like that you know i never i never hear a reports of people you know shooting each other with things like that unless they're out in the woods and drunk and then of course that's a that's another problem right but that's true right that's true but yeah mostly i guess handguns are are create the problems but a lot of people would come back and say well uh you they need it for shooting range and that sort of thing but um-hum once again i think it it may be better to keep the guns uh there and let they can go there and and use them if that's all they need it for yeah um-hum yeah i agree that there's a real problem with uh with injuries and things like that uh sound like we both agree on the fact that things like semiautomatic rifles and and things like that i mean they uh sure i think we both agree that there's there's no uh at least use that i legitimate use that i can think of for a semiautomatic rifle except to kill people i mean that's what they were designed for and that's what they're good for yes um-hum right um-hum now you know i suppose if if there was some way that we could render them unusable well they can always be tweaked around and made deadly once again then yeah yeah i guess if there were some absolute definite way that you could you could make something like that unusable then i then i probably wouldn't have a problem with a collector having one right but i don't know how to do that uh without you know even pouring cement down the barrels probably way to get around that yeah i don't i don't openly i don't i think any gun any gun can be modified to to certain a certain extent to be used as a weapon yeah um-hum so without a total ban there's always going to be guns available but yeah and i think even with a total ban there'll always be guns available right but at that point you know i guess i don't realistically think there's anything you can do about that right you know you you can certainly make the possession of of of of such weapons you know you know the penalties for that very very very strict um-hum but i i guess i feel like you know just like anything else you know you know there's lots of illegal things out there that people that people are you know still getting right but i also ascribe to the theory that you know you know guns guns don't kill people people kill people i mean that that seems to me to be wrong yeah i think i think guns do kill people and that you know you know let's face it i mean if you got a gun that's right it's so much easier in the heat of an argument or something to to hurt somebody than it is with a knife or exactly right that's yeah for example what happened just the other evening uh Evander Holyfield's brother um-hum uh you know they had some kind of disagreement or whatever and next thing you knew he was shot and dead that's right that's right but you know it's interesting there was an incident here in Rochester a a few days ago where uh some people were having a real heavy argument and the guy pulled out a knife and killed the other two people um-hum so you know it it it goes to show it it does prove that even even you know gun gun control certainly has a place but it's not going to be the the cure all of all society's ills sure sure but i guess uh if you look at the NRA's position on it they tend to say that they don't want they really don't want to have any restrictions because they feel that once you get one and it's starts it be gets easier and it may snowball into more restrictions i don't really respect that position yeah um-hum and i think they're kind of getting out of touch with reality in some of their stances no i i think that's an extremist position and i and i don't really subscribe to it either i think on the you know like i said i think there are some legitimate you know uses for guns and that's why i kind of put myself at a five but um-hum  well i have a a couple of of of small children one is four uh the other one's an infant and when we were looking for care for the older child when he was about nine weeks or so i uh i i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very uh low ratio of of children to to care giver so that the so that my infant could could really receive a lot of attention and for that first couple of of years i was able to find that in in a family setting uh uh a a day care provider offering services out of her own home but her circumstances circumstances changed and she lost the the help that she had uh so that they were really now quite a number of of demands on her time and we switched over to to a uh a commercial day care service which actually is the best of of both worlds it's it's not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so it the the youngest one now the the the new infant still receives personalized care uh but at the same school his his older brother is receiving uh basically pre kindergarten care my situation is a little bit different but it still covers the same type of problem i am a grandmother but i'm also employed but my grandson and his father moved back in and lived with us for about a year and so and he was about four so it was sort of like another generation raising a a a child and we're all working adults so it i have some of the same problems it's no longer a problem now that he is older and in school but this has been a problem no matter what generation you're in and one of the things that and then also in the setting where i work i see a lot of uh young people especially uh young women with children who have to take time off because of problems with the babysitting or child care services and i think uh one of the things that and also when i had the grandson my grandson here that we were keeping care of him one of the main problems that affects work and affects the care too is when you're as any when the child is the least bit sick uh uh the you have to come get them there's a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service where there is uh at the same place where they're care for as a well child they have facilities for uh sick care i i i know i i've had the problem myself where the child might might begin to run a a low grade fever and the school calls up and says come get your come get your child uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not come get him yeah it's really true uh come get your child immediately uh it and that's it's it is a big disruption uh it's particularly bad in the first year if you're back to work and you know how frequently that you have to go to the doctor for the little ones just for checkups alone in the first year uh sometimes your boss doesn't think that that's really terrific no but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses and the school doesn't want to want to keep your child we do have up here um and some of the hospitals do this as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children out of their hospital facilities but well that's an interesting yeah that it and it's it's an interesting way to approach it but there's a problem i don't know how many parents would be willing to take their children to a a a location a child has never seen oh that's that's another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services the facility that i work with is a large facility and they're looking at day care now and i would love to see day care on site where if you have lunch you can go over and spend it with a child uh if you have and i would like a twenty four hour day care and it's big enough where it could do that where if you worked different shifts uh you could uh uh bring the child in and but yeah for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime i i know we we would've liked to  hi uh so we're supposed to talk about computers that's it and you own and you own one sure i do don't you course uh okay uh i've got a PC all right do you have a Mac uh-huh okay so do you do you happen to work for some uh computer company up there in no uh actually well yeah i do i i work for Lockheed and uh yeah that's why you have a computer at home no actually i it's like i i have a computer i school when i went to grad school i uh i realized that having a computer would be like that it was going to make my life a lot easier uh-huh does it make a lot easier so sure did uh i mean i you you i don't think i don't know anybody that can get through school without a computer at this point in time uh-huh especially like um it well just for like producing for like for producing papers and things like that um it it was you know it it was like indispensable nobody nobody on the typewriter anymore yeah it's a sort of thing where with the kind of support you can get from software to for for writing things like that uh i writing using a using using a typewriter was sort of like you know uh lighting a fire by like rubbing two sticks together you know instead of using your Bic lighter uh-huh yeah why'd you choose uh have you always had a Mac or why'd you choose a Mac well actually uh i just go with the times and and actually and to human factors and i uh i you know i was into when i was in college i had a Commodore sixty four went to college uh-huh uh oh at at work they had IBM PCs and compatibles and i worked for them for with them for a year few years but i didn't have a need to have have one at home because of as a poor graduate student i didn't have money and also because uh there're plenty of them around at work but then came the Macintosh uh-huh and it they came out with the Mac 2 which is a whole lot more useful than any other Macintosh that that had come out and they also came out with Hypercard uh-huh and i needed to use that for my dissertation work oh really you did your dissertation with Hypercard yeah so i didn't i had to uh use uh i didn't have access to computers at work very easily everyone was wanting to use it so i bought my own and that's where i started and i bought subsequently after that uh well uh replacement ones you're going to tell me you have a Quadra right now right yeah oh no no no no i've had this SE thirty for for number of years now couple years at least uh-huh three years almost now uh i it you know it's like when when i when i decided to like buy a buy a computer so i one of the things that like that i i came down to is is that i i chose my computer on basis of uh of i i don't know i guess at work we would call it like you know MIPS per dollar or something like that uh-huh and it turned i i did a careful analysis i went for my MBA anyway i did a careful analysis of of like of of the of what i could get for how much i was going to spend and it's like it turned out that that that Macs were almost twice as expensive like per feature than PCs were um-hum um-hum and that was like why that was why i chose i i ended up chose chose even though it's like i evaluated Macs as being the superior uh qualitatively better in terms of like you know uh what what they could do and like ease of use and things like that um-hum when i started like uh investigating the cost of software that's when i decided that a PC was like really was more cost effective even though it was the inferior product um-hum um-hum uh well as you know getting we're getting away from that but that's why you have one at home because it was cost effective and you got your work done basically um um-hum it helped me get my work done because uh it's you know i'm i'm into human computer interaction and human and computer interfaces it was one of the better ones and so um-hum yeah no i i i i agree it it is it is it is is superior in that in that case yeah but i you know one of the things that i i i think about in terms of of of like of computers is um it it i think that i don't know it  okay i guess probably the first thing uh we could start off with is uh if you've ever been on a jury before or not oh that's a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact um i was selected for jury at one time but uh fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective uh-huh um-hum i had already changed jurisdiction jurisdictions uh and so i had to reply that i couldn't do it uh right i uh just recently retired from the army and and so when we uh moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and uh it was an interesting experience i'd never done it before and well was it civil or or criminal this was uh all civil although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people before they could actually uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think but the i guess the question that is uh what we think of uh trial by jury that's a hard question yeah well on on the one hand there's a lot of uh of of of positive things you're not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a prejudice right um-hum on the other hand um well juries are not legally expertise experts and and they often just feel bad for somebody right um-hum but which is right they should often uh especially for example in a a civil case yeah they'll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account uh any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view right and it meant um-hum right course you're uh as a juror to you're you're really at the mercy of the uh the lawyers because you don't know what really went on and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth and uh you're kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are uh examining and cross examining the witnesses and they're so it's it's really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual and when you got right down to it uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasn't you can't you can't go by what the the lawyer is uh is saying pretty much and you don't know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth right it's a very difficult decision i found uh one of the things that bothered me was the in one case the the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults you'd think they could have worked their problems out but instead we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don't you people just you're supposed to be adults why don't you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time yeah well it's hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings right so it it uh it gets it's an awful responsibility but it's like voting and all the other things that we're responsible for it's uh all the civic duty yeah one of those things you have to do i guess well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didn't seem to focus on civil things they want more focus on criminals right but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights uh-huh we have it written that uh even for civil cases everyone's guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the uh dispute is for more than twenty five dollars right um-hum now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the Bill of Rights was a lot different than what it is now yeah that was a lot of money and uh basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you don't get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i don't know um-hum right ten thousand dollars i i'm not exactly sure the uh the economics involved and well yeah what the value would be equal to today that's right and uh it makes it very uh yeah oh most cases in small most small cases for uh civil suits really shouldn't have even have the option of a jury um-hum yeah uh i know we i was involved uh in a suit uh where the uh you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and and wanted know you know i don't know five or ten thousand dollars right uh and they requested a trial by jury uh-huh and it seemed like really stupid that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didn't understand the economic principles involved hm um-hum the uh right first one that i had was a drug case and then the second one was a  i'll start in the first place i don't have a family and i don't have a budget okay i don't either neither do i it's called scraping together and it's called what scraping together yeah in my case um i i turns out that i have a pretty good job right now but i grew up in a family that was fairly poor my dad was a college teacher and a high school teacher and we weren't really destitute but we never really had a lot of money so i never really got in the habit of spending a lot of money and so now i just it turns out that i spend less than i make so i never really bother to keep a budget well i i my family was they were okay because i mean my dad uh he um was in the military and then he also had like two other jobs so we lived comfortably i'd say but uh-huh um i pretty well i i get paid i work for the state um i get paid like once a month so i i kind of learn to to set aside a certain amount of money it you know that i could spend each week for like lunch and all this other kind you know expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it so you don't keep actual records of what your expenses are and what your income what you income is and stuff uh well i know what my income is but uh uh my but as far as keeping records i i i have a a ledger that will uh uh how much i owe people whatever and i deduct it out of that oh so you do keep track of it yeah i i i keep i i keep track of it uh i'm not exactly accurate of it every month i mean but you know i keep up with it like once every other month or so get it caught up do you actually balance it at the end of the month uh yeah oh i'm not real good about uh keeping track in checks and stuff like that but uh uh i always keep track of of the ledger who i pay and when and whatever and what the balance is well i just started balancing my checkbook for the first time in my life since i've had a checkbook and i'm i'm thirty two now so for i guess fourteen or fifteen years i've had a checking account but i've never actually bothered to balance it i just always made sure there was enough of money in there if i wrote out a five hundred dollar check i'd transfer five hundred dollars in yeah and i never actually checked to see if my balance matched the bank's and the other day i was well a couple months ago i started thinking you know i should really do that and i had just learned learned how to use Lotus on a PC and uh with Lotus it was pretty easy to set up a a little checking program so i could so it'd keep the balance for me well i work with uh i'm work with an an accounting uh section of Department of Corrections uh-huh in in North Carolina for the state so i i work with Lotus and DataEase a lot so i i'm real familiar with that so that comes second nature to you yeah yeah my i still haven't balanced i figure if i keep doing keep this up long enough eventually someday it'll balance and then at that point then i can try to keep it balanced well i bank with Wachavia and they have this system of of where you can call a number you can call and get all your checks and what your balance is and and what checks is cleared that month or whatever and i do that like maybe twice a month i check to see what you know what checks i've written and always write paid on it when it's paid so i get an idea you know subtract what what what i have in you know in the in my account and what i've i've written checks for that haven't been cleared or whatever so i keep up with it that way too yeah well you spend more time on it than i do that's for sure uh i wouldn't say that i just you know i just i just don't want to write bad checks does your balance match balance match the banks at the at the end of the month um for the most part yeah i i i've got a real good banker uh personal bankers i mean if if i do if i am ever overdrawn she always calls and tells me uh-huh and tells me i need to get the money in or whatever so i say okay and i get it to her oh i don't get that i just get a letter that says we just charged you ten dollars please take care of this oh i wish i wish mine'd only charge me ten dollars or here they charge eighteen eighteen yeah oh so you get a personal call but you also get the charge well not not all the time it's it's like uh this time i i i filed electronically my taxes and uh uh-huh i didn't have quite enough for my mortgage payment and um i told her and i said i'm waiting for them to file that and they said if the mortgage payment you know check gets that before that and i said but it should be you know i it should be deposited before it hits but right and it it didn't the mortgage check hit before but she told me that if it did not to worry about it that she would just uh she she wouldn't charge me she since i let her know a head of time that i was waiting on that and whatever so but the the mortgage payment was due so yeah you like to live on the edge i see well sometimes yeah uh uh i believe in that philosophy of of praying that it don't hit the bank before the check does or deposit does if i want something bad enough i i'll do it but normally i don't do that but in case it's something that's uh-huh  hello this is Tad in Seattle hello Tad this is Glenn in Portsmouth New Hampshire ah well i guess i had to wait a long time till they found somebody uh how long were you hanging around for oh i don't know quite a while i was about to go to sleep well you ready well i'm glad you hung in there okay you ready okay sure okay well um provocative topic as usually oh capital punishment definitely yeah most people have very strong opinions about it usually on both extremes though yeah i uh well what about yourself i'm kind of um waffling i don't know i i uh i don't really like the idea but then occasionally i hear about a heinous crime where i think well if we're going to have public capital punishment then you know this guy should definitely get it one thing that bugs me about it is the uh finality of it i mean occasionally they make a mistake and send the wrong guy to prison sometime later they you know figure it out and they release him um-hum well and uh it bugs me that uh you know this is the one kind of punishment that they definitely can't reverse well i think there's got to be clauses as far as in capital punishment that you can not execute anyone that there's not absolute positive identification and a lot of crimes you uh that a a person is convicted they rely on one person's eye witness testimony um-hum something like that i don't think would be substantial enough uh you know somewhere where twenty people saw watched one person mowed gunned down you know five people that's a clear case of a person who should be executed and i unfortunately that that is not the situation right now those kinds the punishment is not set up in most states you know because as you stated earlier there are some crimes that's so barbaric they uh the person that perpetuates the crime deserves to be uh punished um-hum yeah i uh course usually the case where there's a bunch of witnesses and they see one guy uh mow down a bunch of people and those cases the guy usually turns the gun on himself anyway yeah but unfortunately not in all cases that is really the sad part about it yeah uh the case in Texas where the person uh shot the restaurant yeah i guess it's Ruby's or someplace like that he ended up killing himself but if he had survived uh by some chance i think it would have been criminal if our system had allowed him to live in prison for life well but um if uh if you don't execute sick people um for acting out their sickness uh how by definition can you execute anybody who pulls off a crime like that um-hum i mean since they're obviously insane well i don't think they're necessarily insane course i guess there's a definition of insanity of whether they or not they knew what they were doing that's a little different than what i'm talking about yeah i i think some people can fool the system into believing that they're truly insane it and i'm i even if they are insane yeah i'm sort i'm sort really sort of a hard core on this well uh Dahmer as an example um-hum yeah there are probably seventeen or so victims of his crimes we're going to take care of him in prison uh for an indefinite period of time you know mental hospitals and so forth rehabilitation and that's going to cost us a lot of money and i don't really think that we should be doing something like that you know whether he was uh whether he was ill or not um the crimes were heinous uh yes it's uh it's a good example of where capital punishment would come in handy yeah but uh it it there's a case where the guy's obviously ill i mean a guy that opens up people's brains and performs lobotomies um-hum amateur lobotomies i mean is obviously not rational well then i don't know i don't know whether you can you know morally take the power of the state to end that guy's life i i don't know i maybe that's a good reason to end his life if if he's that irrational well it it i mean what what what would make him rational twenty years of rehabilitation is it really worth spending all that time effort to rehabilitate someone who you may never ever be able to rehabilitate and who it's questionable whether you should be rehabilitated them in rehabilitating them in the first place well yeah i don't know that there's any hope of rehabilitating him but the but then the question comes up does the does the state have the right to do you know essentially the same what he did um-hum well i think the state you know it's one thing to torture someone when you're ending their life which uh was done in the ancient times it's another thing to relatively relatively painlessly inject someone with with uh uh medication to  yeah well i i can tell you here's an interesting interesting story uh my wife uh when we first had our kids decided to home school our kids uh-huh it would is isn't that against well in in is that is is that within the law in Virginia and yeah it's it's interestingly uh there're a couple of different categories categories of home school uh children uh a lot of people take religious exemptions um-hum and those are the people you probably read about all the time in the news you know somebody's somebody's trying to you know get rid of evolution or something and yeah and you know so they don't want their kid to go to school to find out that you know the kid really comes out of the cabbage patch right but uh but in our case uh we actually did it uh we took uh educational you know whatever right uh because we both had advanced degrees and so we just said uh hey look you know we have enough education to to school our kids and the idea was when we first started was to just do elementary school uh level instead of the public schools and do that at at home uh eight six uh eight seven and four um-hum how old are your kids okay uh so pretty young kids and so anyway my wife did all of this all of this schooling and uh you know she had curricula that she bought that they actually sell which we never knew of um um-hum you know it was really complete i mean uh it matched up pretty well with with uh actually matched i thought was better than a lot of the public school curricula but anyway you know you could if you were really religious of course you could get all uh sort of a religious stuff with all the the creation and stuff slant on it right but uh there's actually a lot of uh to us anyway there's a lot of other good stuff out there too so we got a couple actually bought a couple of these programs and for grades you know one through six so like prefab school yeah exactly exactly uh-huh and uh so you know went through it and uh anyway my my wife got to the third grade point with my with my daughter the four year old and the oldest one the eight year old oh uh-huh got to the third grade point and it was just too much i mean it was just the kids were just you know they needed they just needed other kids to be learning with you know and uh also it was a tremendous amount of work yeah sure i i imagine it it it it it really was because see you had to do run at least three curricula three separate curricula in parallel and uh-huh right exactly now it was easier it was actually easier as the younger ones got older because she could just you know kind of take what she had before just the same the same thing that public school teachers do now i mean the right but it it was how how long did you do this for uh she did it for three years three years okay and and actually the kids did really you know uh if you if you believe the tests that uh the state hands out here you know they're supposed to test your uh your um-hum oh so so every year your kids had to do like some kind of a test to be sure that okay yeah right they took a standardized test and uh uh-huh they they always did really well uh and they never seemed to have any problem with it um-hum but i can see in a lot of cases like it it we didn't in a case where you've got people at home where they don't for for you know almost the you know political reasons or whatever they don't want their kids to go to school yeah i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters and i mean if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know oh you mean you didn't have to take them to like a central location and oh no no they sent them to you oh they sent them to oh boy yeah um-hum yeah so you know for us we actually sat our kid down and timed them and everything you know just make it seem like like the real pressure you'd be under uh-huh but uh you know we heard stories we heard all kinds of stories of people you know it's like well if my kid doesn't do well on it i'll just write in the answers you know uh why why why did you decide i mean did did you decide like to to do that home schooling because you didn't think the your local schools were were good enough or yes we did that yes that was the reason but we did that out of total ignorance because we never went to the schools to find out what they really were doing uh-huh oh it was just sort of it was just sort of uh you know hey we remember what public school was like and it was really crappy my wife actually was she's from the Bronx in New York so you know she knew that public schools could be pretty bad yeah did um well what did you think about like you you know you obviously paying taxes for for the for for schools did i mean did and uh yeah oh actually we didn't really begrudge that you know because i mean it's like you know me i mean it's good it's good that uh to you know my opinion is that they should there should be a public school right they they shouldn't make everybody go to it i mean you should be able to go to other schools or if you know if people have the credentials to home school well leave them alone but but uh you know as far as the taxes go i mean i don't yeah yeah big deal nah uh you didn't worry about it what uh eventually you put your kids back in back in to public school how did that right  think of drug testing well i'm one of those grey haired old guys that doesn't think that there's anything wrong with it how about you i don't know i i see it as as a bit of a privacy issues why do you need to tell the company any information i can definitely see it in the case where there's a problem that you know the person's performance is bad or where they have uh you know they suspect something wrong with the person but in a case where there's no problem and nothing suspected what does the random testing do especially since they're only testing for certain things they're not testing for other things uh that could be impairing your ability to perform the job well that that's an interesting question from from the stand point of to me uh a general uh uh you know a a general question is all all substances the particular question in my mind is uh it's very easy to go from from uh how should i say it uh recreational use well let me put it this way from very minor use to uh to very significant use in a short time yes that's true of lots and lots of things and uh yes alcohol is uh one of the most and um-hum when i was growing up uh i i was lucky enough to belong to a family that was where we didn't have to say well dad why how should i say this alcohol and and uh tobacco and all those substances were off limits and at the time i i kind of thought well this is a strict house and um-hum then as i grew older uh in fact one of the guys told me said you were kind of lucky the stuff that we're all trying to quit right now uh smoking and and uh coffee and things like that are things that you never had to that you don't have to quit yeah uh but i i'm i'm not talking about you know about moral character here as much as i am just talking about right um most of the things that that parents in how should i say it the big issue was why can't i do this if you do that dad i mean you come home and have your martini right um-hum yes it's definitely the do as i say not as i do question yeah that was a definite opening for the for the you do your thing and i'll do mine um in my particular case i think that all of those or like alcohol is a is a severe problem um-hum it's happens to be traditionally uh and uh how should i say it it has to be traditionally accepted that the drug testing in my mind is is really to spot the extreme user and if they have to spot the occasional user in the process and and when i say extreme i mean they can you can go from from little or nothing to to extreme very quickly in this game i've been told yeah now i think that's more related to other stresses outside you know if you get into a period where you're very very stressed on your job or very very stressed in your life then you're going to be you know if you have the predisposition then you can turn and your habit goes up and that's very true of alcoholism uh well yes and also the others too i mean i'm yeah i'm not uh uh i guess the way i'm approaching this is it's tough to defend half of the playing field if you don't defend the whole playing field you know um-hum and uh the playing field in in this case is uh some people are trying to say well it's just uh marijuana or cocaine or whatever right uh and i think that's a tough a tough proposition it always has been and and it gave a lot of my uh friend's parents fits yeah but you know it it i i think there's a broader issue there is does a company have a right to know something about a person that doesn't effect their job performance uh and i you know that doesn't effect your job performance i think as a as a real tough uh issue and if i were if i were convinced i mean you know you and i are just talking here and right how how should i say it this is talk for pay so i'm not trying to attack you personally but but uh uh the problem is that i think it does effect performance and and you can go from a from a from no stress at all in your life to being significantly stressed uh in a day yes right and when the uh i i i think that's to a large extent most people you know let let's take alcohol since that seems to be the more public knowledge and more studied of these type of things yeah um i think there's more of a predisposition to it that a lot of people when they get stressed out you and i  um um so child care do you have any children no no i don't uh-huh uh do you yeah we have two we have uh a four year old and a two year old at least they will be in April i'm getting used to calling them that since they're all prepared for their birthdays um-hum are they are they in any sort of child care uh yes and no uh and my four uh three almost four year old is been in a preschool half a day uh since September it's a Montessori school um-hum um-hum um-hum and in a sense that's a day care although we don't use it for day care we chose it because of the educational features of the school um-hum uh prior to that we had a woman come over uh one or two afternoons a week um-hum and uh provide in home day care uh more or less to give my wife you know a break in the afternoons to uh go out and run errands and do things um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we don't really um-hum right um but care for us the the problematic time is in the evening uh just finding babysitters because of the ages we don't really um-hum right it's not that we don't trust but we just don't feel comfortable with uh uh younger kids uh early teens um-hum um-hum uh we've been pretty fortunate we've had babysitters that tend to be in their late teens they drive over in their own cars um-hum uh the older woman who watches the the kids during the day sometimes comes over in the evening so oh that's nice i i've been saved i've only had to take babysitters home twice i guess which isn't bad but we have uh all all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isn't there for us um all all of our families lives in Saint Louis so the normal family infrastructure that uh a lot of people have just isn't there for us um-hum um-hum right right we don't have uh i mean my my wife has a younger sister who's ten years younger but has children the same age as um-hum and we were asking Denise one time well how much do you pay for babysitters she goes i don't know i've only paid one once oh really yeah and that was you know after three years but she just has in-laws and siblings and wow oh okay i see uh you know parents that that watch and neighbors she lives in a neighborhood that has a lot of uh young families and our neighbors seem to be mostly retired um-hum um-hum plus it's harder to to impose on uh you know neighbors uh they're willing to take the kids but it's it feels difficult to impose when they don't have kids themselves right yeah right my do you ever do any babysitting yourself oh yeah i i uh my my job pretty much my junior year in high school was sitting uh for two boys that lived uh right next door to me they uh and i did i did that everyday until uh their mother got home um-hum it's a it's a great job uh it is uh you know for the most part uh especially you know in our house it's um-hum it's clean and neat and the refrigerator's stocked and most the time when they come over in the evening it's you know an hours worth of of real care and then the rest is just taking responsibility for sleeping children right we did have uh one occurrence that was kind of interesting we had two women that came alternatively uh when our daughter was about one year old and uh um-hum it wasn't a problem situation but it was one that just made my wife somewhat nervous the woman wasn't quite together she was easily distracted um-hum she was nice enough the kids uh you know my my daughter liked her but we ended up uh choosing not to to have her on a regular basis making a conscious decision and um-hum right um-hum it was a tough one because it was convenient for us she was dependable in in that she would show up but we just didn't feel comfortable and we see our friends who have kids the same age making more easy decisions uh um-hum um-hum um meaning that uh they're they seem to be pretty lax in in who comes in and who watches them right right we have a friend who has a large house and they have uh three kids under four years old they have twins and they're in they have a live-in housekeeper and it just isn't a person that we would have even to our home on a a regular basis much less on a um-hum um-hum uh live-in basis just different value systems and uh different yeah different attitude towards child rearing um-hum yeah my my father's girlfriend um she's she's a lawyer and so she works you know everyday nine to five and uh she keeps really long hours at the office and uh she's got a little two year old boy and she now has a live in um-hum  uh it was interesting i just read in the paper the other day that they finally sent up the the uh former Soviets whatever you call them now recently set up some relief for the guy that's been up orbiting the mirror space station for the last ten months oh right right i guess he had some culture shock and all the changes that took place while he was in space boy i would think so that's incredible but could you imagine being in a in such an enclosed area for such a long period of time and totally isolated um-hum yeah i don't think yeah it's it's pretty difficult to imagine i think that they don't have the same considerations for the human being as we do in this country no no i don't think so either i i was also kind of surprised that uh i don't maybe maybe there were technical uh limitations on what could be done but it it seemed like a perfect opportunity for the uh United States space program to uh at least offer to get involved with them in in send up some sort of a relief or supplies or something and um-hum get some sort of a union going well i think uh maybe something like that may be in the works in the future trying to get some joint ventures between the two countries in terms of space exploration yeah i hope so i'd like to see something like that yeah i think uh you know the they have a lot of resources over there and probably some cheaper labor and things where we could benefit by purchasing booster rockets or maybe something on that we can probably get from them cheaper than we can produce ourselves right how do you feel as far as spending uh the tremendous amounts of money that need to be spent to keep the program going how do you feel about well i don't know i think it's kind of hard to determine uh the truth i mean you listen to some sides of the story and they they don't they want to cut funding because they feel that the rewards of exploring space are very limited and then there's others who say we can learn a great deal it's kind of hard to figure out what's true and what's not true right yeah it really is it's uh i'd certainly hate to see anything come to a grinding halt um-hum although i guess uh certain logic could be applied to figure out how much spending it can do in any given year or period of years right but i'd like to see you hear talk about this uh future space station that may be built may serve as a a uh intermediate point between like a trip to Mars or something like that and um-hum seems like the next next big step that needs to be taken is interplanetary travel but that also seems so right um i don't know like the thing that some the figment of somebody's imagination yeah definitely at this point it is i have a friend who works for McDonald Douglas in California and there's a prime contractor on the on that space station oh and um i know recently i their funding was at least guaranteed for another year oh is that right so they're going to continue but i've also read a lot of bad things about it how they're talking about the value of the space station is very limited in the amount of information that can be gathered is is minimal but now now that's only one side of the story you know i'm sure if you ask someone from McDonald Douglas they would tell you there's a lot more to be learned from it oh really i would think so i'd certainly think so and then you have the unfortunate mix between military politics and scientific exploration that right they're uh starting up star wars again evidently and that gets i don't know i think a lot of people lump that into the category of space travel even though it really has nothing to do with um-hum uh scientific quest for knowledge it's more uh paranoid yeah preventative thing for the military well i guess i some of the i mean i see a good unmanned type space exploration sending uh satellites and or uh unmanned vehicles into orbit or to other planets like Voyager and that sort of thing that seems to be pretty valuable and maybe more cost effective than trying to put human beings into space definitely definitely in fact it seems uh that a a lot of those benefits were unexpected as far as they had plans for these things and they sent them up years and years ago and they never expected them to be still transmitting data back right that's incredible some of the pictures that have come back yeah and and in a lot of ways it's improving the technology in terms of um signal processing and and data transmission and trying to determine uh a picture from the information the very weak information they're getting back from these signals yeah yeah i agree i think that's definitely been worth while and like you said it's very cost effective and and that's probably yields as much information as as having somebody actually up there um-hum although i sure wouldn't mind being the guy that's actually up there oh really yeah yeah i think so i don't know i don't know if it's quite as glamorous as it it seems like it would be i i don't think it's glamorous i probably wouldn't enjoy it all the time while it was happening but boy could you imagine looking back  oh sure i guess this sort of relevant for me because i'm a college student so you know i would have been affected by it you know a couple years ago i guess probably or after i graduate i don't know how it would be set up um i have sort of mixed feelings about the whole thing i mean i think it would sort of be uh sort of a bonding experience in a sense for people in the country and the you know people of of uh sort of all different uh um-hum you know socioeconomic racial uh you know geographic even uh you know groups who would be mixed together and would sort of work together which i think would be a positive thing that would be a good coming of age experience yeah i mean i you know i think i think that that that would be a very probably the most positive part of it and you know it's also good to do uh to do volunteer work but on the other side i sort of you know wonder whether or not the government uh would run a program like this intelligently i mean yeah that's a really big problem and that's my main objection to something like that today looking at uh the track record on um you know responsible management i'd really have to say that i think it'd be guaranteed that the government would have a real problem yeah i mean the for example the Peace Corps has been a real success i think but the problem with that is that uh you you know it's a it's a small program and i don't know whether they could find worthwhile work um for everyone in the country sort of uh and also you know and still still manage it well i think they might be tempted for example to to not spend as much money as they should i mean they'd say look we have all this free labor let's not spend any money and so they would end up using people and their talents very inefficiently um-hum yeah yeah that is a big problem especially with organizations get bigger and bigger but there are a lot of little little problems like uh illiteracy yeah uh some other things that could stand having some manpower thrown at it yeah i mean i think yeah again if it if the if it was used efficiently and people you know worked on on real problems as opposed to just sort of make work then uh i think it could have very positive impact yeah um i just i haven't seen i haven't seen any of the detailed proposals for that i don't have you no i have no idea i mean i know people sort of floated the idea around but um i don't really know that much about it in the early eighties um for economic reasons and wanting money to go to school i went into the Marine Corps for four years and the mismanagement and the waste there was really disgusting totally really disturbing remember uh the first year that i paid a thousand dollars in federal income tax i watched that thousand dollars wasted that day hm there were some radios that um had been sitting on a shelf and they had some schedule or every eight months they had to be checked whether they were used or not and that's a practical idea but before i left i saw those very same radios rotate through again and they'd been through many times before items that have been contracted out and paid for and that that in the end hadn't been built to specifications all kinds of stuff like that that was really disturbing hm for you know a big organization like that that a lot of people go off and do the kind of coming of age thing as well yeah and the part of the problem i mean even even i think probably a little bit of the problem with the military is that you know people only stay for a few years a lot of the people and so there's not yeah and a lot of them want out because it's so disgusting yeah and there but there's no sort of continuity to it i mean you don't have people that sort of feel responsible for uh you know the area they're working or whatever i think you'd have that problem even worse if people were only in for a year yeah a year's too short for any kind of continuity you're absolutely right and they probably wouldn't yeah and they and they probably wouldn't hire enough permanent personnel to really you know make the glue to keep the whole thing functioning well um so i yeah i i don't know i mean i i think if if it could be made to work well it would be a good idea if it would just be sort of a giant waste of people's time then i think it would be you know exactly that a waste of time and money yeah i wish our generation had better memory of things like the uh the New Deal and all the things that went on then when Roosevelt had uh all kinds of people working in they were getting paid but it was a uh you know building highways and stuff like that yeah i yeah i do think i mean i do think that's that's one part of it you would have to pay people i mean yep absolutely and either that or you know sort of like the military i mean the military doesn't pay people very much but you know they provide housing or whatever i mean yeah there's got to be enough compensation for you to survive for a year yeah you've got to be able to you know to pay people to live more or less i mean you can't expect them yeah this isn't the ancient Soviet army where you if you have the money you go in yeah yeah you need you need to uh you need to provide a way for people to live so for that reason alone it would be it would be expensive um and so maybe that's almost one of the big drawbacks to it yeah that and especially with the the things uh money running the way it is today and the federal  what kind of car do you have well at the moment i got two cars one voluntary and the other one involuntary i have a ninety Taurus and a nineteen seventy three Dart which i've been trying to sell for over a year uh-huh yeah how do you like your Ford uh it's been fine it hasn't caused very much trouble it was a lot better than that Dart was the first year and it lasted for eighteen um the oh maybe that's a good sign yeah maybe you never can tell i've uh uh you know it it got better as it got older really um it was quite reliable when it was less than ten years old it started to get a little bit less reliable once it passed its tenth birth date but yeah yeah i think they have that tendency i've got a Ford Ranger that i drive and uh i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my window my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced um-hum somebody busted it out so they do that in Minneapolis too i just yesterday well yeah i they uh i had a uniform my band uniform hanging in there and they stole that so that was kind of um kind of a bad thing but well it's it's probably easy to catch you know if it's the band is distinctive yeah it's pretty distinctive i don't know what in the world they wanted with it i think it was just kids you know neighborhood kids or something right so right here i have a list of my repairs oh i i do uh actually why didn't i bring this up i i i write a newsletter at Christmas time and i had an article on cars this year and i can just look at that if i can find it before our time expires um yeah yeah actually uh but it had an analysis of the cost of my uh eighteen year old car versus my newer car uh let's see there oops trying to yeah real time this is interesting looking up things in real time here um uh-huh all right well actually with regard to Ford the the truck has not been too bad to me um-hum but i don't like Ford at at all the company itself um-hum because i did have a few problems and they've been utterly non responsive hm so whoever i meet i always tell that to them just to make sure everybody knows how i felt i've gone through the dealership and it dealerships used to have a bad reputation for not wanting to do service on cars that they hadn't sold but yeah the local dealership here which which is not one that sold me the car they've been very good in doing the repairs not that they got the fixed the first time but yeah that that's great is is Raleigh so big or or or or is it so busy that you can that that you can't get in very well or or how does that work there but uh no i well i i call them and say which day you know i'd like to bring it in on Thursday that's usually the best day and see if they're if it's okay and it usually is and hm that's good you know i ask them what time and they tell me see i i live in Orlando generally but i'm up here for a year and then i go back down to Orlando i see uh-huh and down there there are no appointments you go first come first serve which makes it really kind of difficult if you work uh-huh yeah but uh no down there i haven't had much luck except for one Ford dealership in Gainesville Florida that's really very good um-hum that's a long way from Orlando Gainesville yeah oh you mean Minneapolis' a long way no no no no Gainesville i know Orlando Orlando aren't they about an hour and a half drive two two and a half a two and a half two and a half okay so if you live in Orlando and you go to Gainesville for repairs you must be an well my family lives in Gainesville ah okay so occasionally i go up there and and it it happened it so happened that my gear shift lever broke off at the stem when i was in Gainesville so i i had to i had to drive it about fifteen miles an hour all the way to um-hum um-hum to the Ford dealership but kind of an interesting thing ooh yeah okay so i find that that my total auto expenses uh dropped from twenty four hundred dollars to eighteen hundred dollars when i when i went from my old car to my new car repairs went down from eleven hundred ten dollars a year eighty eight to ninety nineteen ninety average to a hundred ninety four dollars in nineteen ninety one wow and the first uh that was uh that was from backing into a post it was well hidden in a park in a uh a gas station uh oh the first figure you gave me twenty four hundred excuse me yeah twenty four hundred was the expenses uh that was that that that included gasoline repairs maintenance fees and insurance and other expenses i've got one for you if you uh reverse the first two digits of that and make it forty two hundred that's approximately what i spent in two years on a seventy four Volvo i had it was constantly giving me problems um-hum um-hum um-hum wow and when you when you say you spent it do you mean does that include gasoline or is that just repair no this is strictly uh structural and engine repairs things that had to be done yeah like new new transmission things like that yeah i was really upset because i was a an undergrad college student at the time and not making a whole lot of money right oh yeah so uh it was that was one car that i really i liked it a real love hate relationship with it i liked the car because it felt good and it and it drive it drove well when i drove it but then again it had all these problems so um-hum um-hum it uh was kind of a bitter sweet relationship i guess i was uh kind of sorry i got rid of my car when i did well now i'm not because it's much  okay um Bryan you've said you have one child right now have you had any problems with day with child care services yes well yes uh yes in fact we have had a uh a minor problem we've we tried to use the child care facility at the tennis club that we belong to and just didn't feel that it provided the kind of quality care that that we want for our child at this point um-hum um so it is in fact difficult to find uh quality services uh did you utilize utilize that full-time while you were working no um my wife doesn't work so we were just uh planning on trying to use that as a as a break in our activity and to give her a little more free time um-hum but the uh the the center that we went to had we've felt like uh had too many children for each counselor and so you know any any child that had any kind of problem or was just upset wasn't going to receive the kind of attention that we wanted our child to have um-hum and uh i'm i'm sure that's that's the problem with many uh care centers like that it's uh a difficult task to provide you know reasonable cost child care what type of costs were you facing excessive or no it was uh i think it was four dollars an hour um-hum what i was what i was thinking of was that you know for the for the uh the sitter to be able to provide low cost care they you know they can't pay too much for the counselors and can't provide too many counselors per child um-hum but it's you know we're we're used to used to just uh just felt more comfortable with uh you know with more of a babysitter situation where the the child has has the full attention of someone yeah we're at a stage in our life where we don't have any kids yeah but we're approaching that point where we're going to have make a decision as far as does does my wife continue to work or do i continue to work to uh right make ends meet and do you put child child in day care somewhere along that lines and the reality is that we'll probably have to have a child in day care right and uh been thinking about how much that's going to cost it's uh rather frightening figure you really cuts into your income yeah uh right one of the things we have at our my company is uh day care reimbursement program we actually put money away into a tax free hm uh program um and they it's you're reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided it's used specifically and only for day care right it's probably one of the few programs that i've seen uh that accomplished that right it it helps out a little bit yeah but unfortunately i'm not you know able to tap into that until we have kids so that's down the road a little bit right but i do have some brothers and sisters who are struggling as as as it is right now to make ends meet and they're also very uncomfortable with the idea of day cares but they're forced into that situation right now yeah it's it's difficult i i don't know whether we'll find it easier when when the child gets a little bit older say one year old when it doesn't seem quite so vulnerable to uh you know to the outside world and my my wife keeps wondering how you know how how anybody can turn the child over to uh what's day care and i just tell her that you know it's just it's not a matter of choice for most people we're fortunate we we have a choice you know most people i know who have had to make that decision the spouse usually the the mother in situations that i can think of have been in tears they've dreaded the moment right for throughout most of the pregnancy knowing that they'd have to eventually go back to work and uh when the time actually came to send your child child child to day care it was basically a very traumatic moment right in my i see my wife nodding in the corner as she dreads that date too i imagine yeah but it uh unfortunately it is a reality you just can't get by without well very few people can get by without two incomes um yeah it's true least especially in the early stages of a career yeah yeah it it does make it difficult to because now our child's six months old and you know essentially my my wife hasn't been away from him from more than a few hours at a time um-hum so that takes its uh emotional toll on her do you find any uh that there would be any benefits to a day care such as exposure to uh unlimited basis exposure to other kids um developing social interaction yeah we think so we we we think that is important we're just not not sure at what  well yes so so do you do much exercising uh only for fun i really enjoy it though so uh let's see what do i do in the winter i play volleyball yeah what do and i go skiing that's about it oh you go skiing eh yeah well out here in the west you've got some nice places to go skiing well i must admit that Utah has the best snow on earth anyway um i haven't been in a regular exercising program do you have a regular program that you actually you know stick to or uh do you have it planned out or is it just you do exercise for recreation recreation yeah it you know i do it for the fun i can't stand say stationary bicycle um-hum gets pretty boring or like uh you know lifting weights because i can't count more than to three before i get bored and then i lose track of the repetitions but uh the uh you know the the gym's open say for volleyball on every Wednesday so so that's regular so you go so you like regularly do volleyball yeah i used to i used to regularly run and then about a year and a half ago i had some back problems yeah and i haven't been able to get out and run and i have really noticed it in a year and a half i've gone from being fit to being a vegetable i feel like such a vegetable now but so you must be over twenty then yeah i'm i'm over twenty i'm going down the gentle slope yeah when you're about when you're under twenty five you can pretty much get away with uh doing nothing and then when you want to get do something something athletic you just get up and do it otherwise i find you've got to every week everyday yeah if you want to have any sort of shape yeah so anyway i'm looking forward to the Spring as it comes around to trying to get back into running now that i'm running that doesn't bother your knees at all no great no i've never had problems with my knees at all um uh the that's not not at all a problem it's more just uh the other thing i do is i run with my wife and so we go kind of out together and we don't run hard like like we jog and like kind of just go see places and kind of run around together and it's not like we go real hard or anything but it's enjoyable well it's hard to get no exercise while running i mean you pretty much got to move don't you oh yeah well you do i mean it's it's really jogging but i mean you can push yourself at different levels how hard you run well even just walking well but you know like say riding a bike where if you go really slow it's pretty much coasting you're not even doing anything and just to move while running you've got to move your legs every single step hm so you don't you don't feel you're getting a good exercise when you go out uh jogging oh i do but i don't feel that it's that hard i it's not that stressful you know you're asking about how it was on the knees or on the body and that stuff and it's not oh okay it's not really stressful at all in any i mean it's it's fun and it's enjoyable and it's good exercise but all right yeah it's not supposed to hurt i just find that it really pounds because i'm in particular running you you do you run no no that's i and i'd like to because i think it'd be fun i run in connection with you know in case i accidentally play basketball or uh so you know football you know something there's all sorts of activities where you end up running it's just sort of a natural thing um but i don't do it just for the sake of running how about swimming for a while i used to swim yeah you know swimming is something i've gotten to the point where i action actually can do laps now uh uh-huh that used to bore bore me to tears you know i'd love to swim if it was water polo or you know splashing about or you know if there was some diversion just uh but but that's good exercise um yeah i'm looking forward to that it's i can does this extend out from like high school or something like that athletics or anything that you used to do in high school uh i used to run some cross country in high school but yeah see that that gets back to this lack of discipline and training i i would never join a team because they'd want you to do these repetitions or something uh-huh rather than let just play the game  okay were you drug tested when uh well actually interestingly enough a lot of times oh where where do where do you work at well i just retired from the Army after twenty years of uh active uh service uh uh retired out of the Pentagon and because of the organizations that i was in in the military oh and the jobs that i held and particularly because of the security clearances that i had we had first of all we had regular random testing just because we were in the military just because you were in the service yeah right and then because of the security clearances that i held i also had uh other regular random uh drug testing for that as well that i actually had to sign an agreement saying that uh were they like urine tests or were they blood yeah it was all urine testing um-hum and it was mainly because of their concern because drug use is illegal uh and of course addictive uh it's a perfect thing uh for blackmail for people with high security clearances and so i've kind of over the twenty year period of time i've gotten kind of accustomed to it and that's right that's right oh okay so it doesn't really bother you that much or doesn't bother me uh uh because i've always been in sensitive positions that i understand the the problems that can results uh as far as compromise and espionage and uh addiction and blackmail that that has never bothered me exactly yeah i work for a defense contractor down here uh Pratt Whitney and uh uh-huh and i work for a defense contractor in Virginia called Network Solutions we uh uh we actually operate the NIC for the internet oh okay yeah you probably got uh uh information about this program through the internet that that's exactly where i got it from right all of us did yep so uh now we don't have any drug testing out there uh oh okay so yeah at Pratt Whitney you do it's the you you have to pass your drug test in order to do uh to get employed there you have to pass it uh-huh uh-huh huh and uh it's for the same reasons uh you hold you hold a i have a secret clearance and uh right uh-huh you know i guess they just want to make sure that uh like you said that nobody can uh hold anything against you you know make information and then say well we'll turn turn you in for these drugs if you unless you do this and that um-hum right exactly i guess so there's uh still a good bit of discussion and controversy about whether it's an invasion of your privacy and uh that sort of thing yeah yeah there is and i and i can see why you know especially especially if you do do especially especially if you use illegal drugs i can see why you wouldn't want it it to happen to you and yeah right especially right you don't want to get caught and even if you don't you know it's like well geez you know what else what else could they use this stuff for you know and if it is kind of an invasion of privacy it is an invasion of privacy um-hum yeah as a matter of fact uh that's such a difficult question to to answer because on the one hand sure uh uh drug testing is an invasion of property or of privacy but yet on the other hand yeah right for example these uh guys that drive these trains and that sort of thing that uh have been high and uh killed a lot of people yeah it's it's uh right that's right you i know it see what a small price to pay to to save some lives it saves us one life you know drug testing it's worth it but um-hum right and i think for the most part the general public tends to support it but uh i'm sure organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union uh the ACLU probably have their yeah yeah and they're worried about abuses of it sure and that that can really happen hm uh and that sort of thing not just drug testing but lots of other things uh for example blood tests that determine whether you have particularly diseases or not like AIDS uh can be construed to be an invasion of property or of of privacy because it effects your insurance and your employability and yes that that that stuff should be kept confidential far as that goes yeah and it's it but yet if that's that's in any kind of a computer database somebody's going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so it's accessible that's right it's one of those problems that it's really hard to come up with an answer to yeah and uh yeah you have you ever heard of anybody cheating on those uh urine tests yeah oh yeah in i know i know a guy who was who cheated and got in out there at Pratt and uh he took somebody else's with him and just um-hum yeah put it in there so it you you can get around them if you have to oh yeah there were guys in the military that were selling their own urine yeah because they uh just had to be careful that they didn't do the test and uh show that you came up pregnant depending on who you got your sample from it that could be really bad so but uh oh that could be real embarrassing then you could be caught real bad and they were really protective what do they what do they do to you in the military if you get caught what do they do to you if you get caught um-hum well it depends now if you have a you know that was the other funny thing if you had a high security clearance like my people had um-hum uh and you got caught and these guys were shift workers it really worked out well for them because of course the first thing that happened was that their security clearance was suspended and then they were removed from access to sensitive information which means they got a straight day job at the company oh so it it was really to their advantage to get caught and oh man but it wouldn't didn't look good on their record though of course yeah and in the long run of course uh that was a problem and it kind of depended also on on how often they uh were caught whether they were in a rehab program and  i'll start okay um my feeling is that you become a politician perhaps because um you think you're doing something noble perhaps because you're on a power trip but um-hum what it all comes down to is you are doing this because you think that your approach is better than what another person's approach is and you're looking to impose their will upon them your will upon them um-hum and um so there's a fundamental problem um-hum okay is that you you get into this to impose your will upon others um-hum if you um could do it you know if you didn't need to impose your will then you could just do it by suggesting or writing articles in newspaper or what have you right right but it it does seem like a problem that the only people who become president are people who want to be president and i don't really know if i want anybody who really wants to be president well i think that the uh what do you call it uh you know those those guys who took pen to parchment a couple hundred years ago um-hum had some good ideas and um one of the things that i think has gotten out of hand um-hum is what the government does what kind of things they get involved it that's possible um there was a time when the government wouldn't wouldn't think of telling you what you could eat or smoke um there was a time when the government wouldn't think of um imposing heavy taxes on transportations on on your means of transportation to uh build uh roads where they wanted them um and i think those those are the first of things that come to mind i think that um if what the government sets out to do is fairly limited um-hum then the people who decide they want to be politicians can't get into a whole lot of trouble that's true um it's only when you try to run every aspect of life from cradle to grave that when a politician runs amok they can do serious damage that's an interesting point so you're you're taking sort of a libertarian view here oh absolutely um you know i think that uh we've gotten ourself into a lot of trouble um i think that well i think that getting ourselves out of it is going to be painful um-hum um i hope it happens peacefully um-hum because it will happen now what sort of uh what sort of which part which sort of trouble are you speaking of well we're in a situation right now where um uh the comment even in a situation right now where um large portions of your life are controlled by forces that aren't particularly interested in your welfare and um what sort of control the quality of life is deteriorating uh what control what sort of controls are you thinking of well take well taking half your income is uh a pretty good one uh not being permitted to defend yourself is another one um or what sort of areas you know life um i don't know what the laws are like in New York in in California but in New York um if you wake up one night and go down stairs and see a fellow about to climb out the window with your TV set you cannot use deadly force against them well then the question is so he's climbing out the window with your TV set yeah with your TV set and you feel that a fitting punishment for television theft is death um um well there's an interesting issue there uh let's suppose someone breaks the window of your car and steals your radio um-hum all right um we look at this and we say okay fine it's three hundred dollars damage just picking a number off the top of my head um-hum let's suppose you make thirty five bucks an hour uh thirty bucks an hour to make the math easy um-hum theoretically ten working hours of your life have just vanished oh sure and and and don't quote on the uh example of insurance because that means those ten working hours of someone else's life got vanished right and you're pay for it eventually yeah one way or another um so when material objects are destroyed you know it's it's it's it's you you you it's it's a um how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way um-hum you know it's not as cut and dry and radical as uh you know as um when someone is killed in cold blood but uh there is a very very subtle effect there and i think one of the problems we have with law today is that um-hum when somebody runs out and passes a law be it increase in taxes be it what have you generally speaking um-hum um you're not creating anything you're just moving stuff from one place to another okay you're moving some kind of uh you know if if you um very strongly reinforce the particular enforce enforce enforce a particular um civil right um one of the example that comes to mind is Miranda okay okay um which i think is a good thing um but  have any children no uh i'm single and but i've i been keeping an eye on what the child care situation is and i have several friends that do have children well what do you think about child care i mean i don't have any children so well it's it's uh it's i i feel that uh regulation uh uh whether be at the state or federal level is a must so we can have some sort of standards from one place to another uh that uh in terms of cleanliness uh the ratio between the uh adults to children is maintained uh food and so on i don't think one person one adult should have like twenty children to keep after well well do you think that how many children do you think they should be allowed or should be in one facility at one time well the facility i i don't have a problem with it's just how many adults or how many children to an adult and if if i remember correctly um one adult for six children was very good for around here and was more twelve to twelve children one to one adult was about the average but then and well in public school um you have one teacher for every thirty kids and so on but the but in day care usually the child is not able to um function totally on his own whether if it's if it's uh a toddler uh diapers have to be changed uh must be tended to constantly for fear that they might get into something well um do you think that there is enough child care available in your area i think there is it's just that sometimes location makes it difficult if if if i was married there is no place between my house and work that is convenient that i could uh use as for child care they're usually in areas where they can they can afford to set up shop and not where it's convenient for the people that are working um-hum well do you think that employers should provide child care well some companies i've noticed will provide the facilities and then let a let a uh a company come in and provide the child care while the employer's just providing providing the the facility um-hum in many cases like in large companies that becomes a perk to the employees where they're able to get reduced child care and in and in the case of uh new mothers they're able to go uh instead of a cigarette break they can go see their child for ten minutes and then go back to work you have a better retention then of um people by not having them go on sick leave or uh paid holiday to take care of their children and so it saves the company money it's in the company's best interest well i think that really am i am all for employers providing some kype type of child care or at least the facility and i don't think we really have enough of that no it's it's it's a relatively new idea from what i understand it's has uh enough companies haven't gotten on the bandwagon they where they could see a realization and um savings of money right now by people being at work and not taking off and being at home if you make it convenient for them people will stay uh stay or stay with the company if you if there're more perks like that you can give them it's not just money it's it's everything about it and child care is a big issue it's important to me if i was married and had children i'd want to be as close to my kids as i possibly could oh i know and i think that if i had children and i couldn't find adequate child care i probably wouldn't want to work i'm the same way but then again how do you provide for the child when you can't work you you i know you really don't have a choice but then um i'm my boss had a case where um his baby got sick in child care and um all the babies at the child care place that he went to all came down with an ear infection and that's i think there should be some kind of um health regulation or or some kind of i don't know how bad i mean i can see how it could happen with all the children there together um-hum  Joan uh you live in a in a big city Dallas huh what's i guess crime is is a problem there or a concern isn't it right um-hum a big one it is and and uh getting out to the suburbs heavily uh-huh it is yeah and i work in a high school here and we're just starting to see weapons in the high school in the suburbs and that's scary uh uh-huh what do you think is uh much different situation than we had even three years ago you know uh-huh well you know we we i live in a uh in a city that's uh twenty five about twenty five thousand and it's in the northeast and we really don't have a um-hum a crime problem and we have the burglaries and the occasional bank robbery and things like that but nothing uh real serious nothing like a big city crime um-hum um-hum but from my observations it seems to me that uh that drugs seem to be the engine driving crime in American cities today what do you think right i think it's the basis for every for it all really it's a big part of what our problem is and this gang situation which is which um-hum the need for money uh-huh comes from you know the drugs are involved in it but it the gang situation is very serious here also uh-huh i guess that's serious in uh California too in Los Angeles and some of the other cities there right right but even in our suburbs here and in our school we're you know we're it's not a noticeable down the hall thing you know yelling in our suburb but it's still is um-hum enough that you know which one's you pretty well pick out which ones are in the gang type uh-huh and are the gangs uh selling are they in enterprise are they selling drugs is that one of the reasons for gangs well one one of it right but another thing is just territory you know they just want to control things uh-huh and uh but drugs is a major is is the major i would say um-hum problem of them all all of our crime you know the basis of it right i think if somehow or other we can yeah continue to crack down on drugs uh that i think it will help reduce the crime because the need for money and um-hum and also the lack of judgement that comes from using drugs uh you know people i think have a diminished capacity to know right from wrong when they're using drugs that's true that's true uh-huh but um we also have um oh we have a lot of our um counselors and all they've come up with so many groups that they didn't use to have to have you know as far as the counseling and coming up with the student groups student help groups uh-huh and um of course the the say no to drugs and this and um Students Against Drunk Driving is very big in our school that's big up here to and and SADD which is very big right right and i think that's an effective program i do but uh us all that basis that they start but i i think they're probably finally uh realizing that they have to start in the primary grades um-hum training these kids and i some of the programs you see on the TV i haven't seen a whole lot of them in our schools here um-hum but um some of the programs that they're showing in the primary where they're starting out right in the first second kindergarten grades um-hum having the um plays you know plays the whole thing role playing teaching the dangers of it uh-huh um-hum but they off drugs i think it's a good situation yeah i think that's that's true i think and i think it's going to have to start there because it's not working you know it overall it's such a large payola and all in the actual when it when it gets up to the older people and the um law enforcement and all that um-hum i think that's being paid off big time do you have a program called DARE down there also right well that's that's uh active up here um-hum right but that's all recent you know that's all been in the last three about four years uh-huh that they've come in with all of those right and had to so and and the alcohol is a big there another big you know well the drugs is part of the alcohol is the drugs but i mean alcohol is also a major problem these kids that are you know tenth graders come into school all all ready loaded that's pretty scary sure is you find that uh do you find is it your observation that most of the crime is in a certain age group certain range of ages twenty five something like or um yeah not not really necessarily no not necessarily anymore yes it used to be no but anymore you'd find a lot of the younger thirteen fourteen in that age group oh is that right um is um starting heavily into it how about the gang membership that seems to be mainly teenagers caliber and that's mainly uh so far uh-huh that's pretty well into the teenagers you know in the teenagers uh-huh and they usually start that around junior  talk about home repairing i understand uh-huh did have you had any recent experience well i'm not a home owner but i consider myself to be pretty handy uh oh okay well i'm sure you are mean usually are but i don't i don't uh i don't uh it's kind of uh it's kind of a hard thing to to talk about having a limited experience base i mean i fix things around here rather than uh rather than bother a landlord with it i'll you know repair a sink or um um-hum um-hum actually i fixed our water bed that was pretty handy but but how about you that's right well i had an experience uh this summer as a matter this past summer hm not this and what happened was that my closet rod fell down uh-huh uh-huh and i went into the closet and this closet is probably fifteen feet long um-hum and all my clothes were on the floor and i said oh my word oh yes they're very heavy oh boy and they're heavy too you don't think about how heavy it is and um so i i thought now because i'm alone and i said now who am i going to get to do this because i sure don't i wouldn't i know one end of the hammer from the other one but that's about it i wouldn't know how to address a nail properly at all uh-huh so i scoured the little paper that we get in the neighborhood and i found uh uh a handyman and he said that he was an ex-teacher and i thought well he sounds like the kind of caliber that i would not be too leery of and i called him and he did a marvelous job and i and i got to know him pretty well and i said uh he said Catherine he says if you this house will fall down but these closet these close rods will not fall down he says that's how good they're in there he says i guarantee this for life hm yeah uh-huh so that really pleased me and he did a marvelous he did a fantastic job and he also uh replaced my door in my garage uh uh-huh i had been robbed uh the year before and um um they wanted to charge me six hundred dollars to replace the side door and i thought no you're not i'm not paying six hundred dollars six hundred dollars American money American money wow and Ken did it for me for like two hundred and thirty dollars and he gave and he gave me a solid core door and you know i just said i knew that i would find somebody that would do this at a price that was realistic six hundred dollars for one single side door that's well he said well that's including labor and i thought okay Charlie i said that sounds silly hm boy very extreme yeah that was a that was a good deal you got yeah so actually it was a really bad deal that they they tried to give you i guess yes it was well see they thought that they could prey on my uh recent loss that i would be in a panic to have this door fixed because that was the door that the intruders broke through but but the insurance company had made it so that nobody could get in because they put two by fours over it and nailed it shut oh yeah yeah that's kind of yeah that would and uh so i mean if they wanted to get in they would have had to use a mac truck to get through the bars and hey i'm sure someone probably if they if they were interested they would have you know that yeah well they you know the insurance adjuster said if if they are bent on getting your house they'll they'll they'll plow through your brick yep they won't stop it uh he said there's not anything that's going to stop them if they're determined the they'll stop at nothing but i'm glad you got your home fixed that's that's important i i put up uh closet organizers one year and uh uh i don't know if you're familiar with them up here they call them the California closets they're wire uh uh basically they subdivide your closets into all sorts of little nooks and crannies oh i see they organize them oh okay yeah and shelves and so instead of having just a little one rod you have racks and shelves and stuff and you have uh rods but those are bi-level rods there's two sets upper and lower then sort of doubles the hanging space then sure how how do you like that oh they're great oh wonderful they're great and um you know they're wonderful so you can utilize all of your closet space by having those oh yeah oh yeah and instead of having shoes or whatever on the floor and and things like that in your closet they have little shelves on the side that you can that's wonderful um-hum you can still stack things on they have they have all sorts and uh you know they sell them in our the local home stores here and uh i'm sure that you can pick them up down there but it's a really uh the way they put them together it's really not hard at all to put them um-hum put them in it takes about an afternoon it was a Sunday afternoon you know and uh you lay it out and they give you little things that you mark uh on your wall tells you how to um-hum um-hum  okay well let's see invasions of privacy actually um i can't think of too many except uh oh occasionally my employer uh-huh or um sometimes it seems of a bit of an invasion when i when i get calls from phone solicitors yeah that's that's one of the that's also that's also for me invasion of privacy that's also a one of my pet peeves well i get i've uh figured out someways creatively as to fight back with phone solicitors though okay like um well i i've discovered it's kind of fun to try to take control of the conversation uh-huh uh like you know typically they're reading from a script right so if you start asking questions right away uh-huh or do anything that's a little out out of the ordinary they get really thrown oh i see so like often what i'll do is i'll call up and say hi i'm Carla from XYZ company and i'll say excuse me uh what's your name again and uh act like i'm writing it down and could i have your last name Carla um-hum um-hum and what's the name of your company you know and this by this time they're really shook up and then um i ask her uh uh Carla could i have your home telephone number please um-hum and and they go well uh no i go well why not i said well i don't give out my home number as well why not i mean you're calling me at home i ought to be able to call you at home and that really shakes them up well that's good you have a good sense of humor with it i i would do something like talk to them for like two minutes or something and then say uh well you know the person to talk to isn't isn't isn't here right now wait a minute i think they're just just a minute let me see if they're here and then you leave yeah right or put them on hold yeah and see how long yeah see how long they'll wait but yeah well another thing you can do is you can pretend that you got them on call waiting yeah say i'm on long distance on the other line or you can just say no thank you and hang up yeah right well i yeah well one of my Tad T A D okay uh one of my things one of my pet peeves is social security numbers ah and that is um i'm an adult but i'm going back to school and everywhere on the campus where i write a check it's they want social security numbers on everything and i just go bananas because it's just it's number one it's none of their business and it and it doesn't have they want it they want it to be put on your check yeah and those are used as pin numbers a lot like with my bank uh uh if i want to move money around over the phone or check my balance or anything the pin number they want is the last four digits of the social security right exactly and plus in California they have this new thing where they have the magnetic stripe on the back of the driver's license i don't have one yet yes really i didn't know that huh yes and that's another thing so they think they can plug you in for a profile see and i well now where where do they use the stripe in a a reader oh you mean like when a cop pulls you over he runs it through a reader or something right exactly well that's amazing but see what's happening though is that it's starting be integrated to going they're going to try to integrate it into the stores too really so so but the stores can't get all the information yeah well like the stores can probably develop their own databases but they can't get into the department of motor vehicles right i'll bet that's it but the yeah but in other words so they can verify they can go in and and get the card and get information off it but the the police reader could get more information you might say yeah because they could but i i just i don't i i don't like the idea i don't like the idea of business and information you know and in the world is coming to is is is information well then you know about caller ID oh exactly oh yeah yeah hey did you get uh did you get the number for this off of the internet yeah i did oh okay are you an internet man yeah most of the uh most of the people i talk to on here are on internet yeah yeah did you get it off of uh Telecom Digest yeah oh yeah i read that constantly so do i yeah yeah i post on there from work under Paul Cook at Proctor and Associates okay and at home as Tad Cook i see yeah yeah i have an account at school so i'm able to do that oh yeah well i got mine from a friend of mine uh owns a Unix consulting firm and gave me a free account there a few years ago oh i see so i can just dial it up and so you have a free dial you dial in free yeah yeah it's real neat yeah what is it is it eight hundred number or you just happen to be within the boundaries oh i'm with yeah we're in actually almost exactly the same exchange i'm real near his office oh okay right yeah but it's uh it's it's pretty neat he doesn't have a full UUCP fee but i yeah yeah well if you if you're on you're on the usenet groups you might try uh alt privacy i yeah i'm on this uh moderated one a mailing list uh that's uh Telecom  tell you what this is later all right um well personally with me i think we ought to introduce it to the young people but i don't think you can force it upon them because if you force it upon them they i don't know i it wasn't forced upon me and i i with it beings more my idea it i tend to just stick with it a little bit longer yeah i'd say ten years is a good while especially do is yours on a renewal basis is it do you have to renew each year or no i i just i go through and i i work on like a monthly basis i do you know like one weekend a month type thing uh do you have a do you have a minimum requirement for your community service is there a commitment like a term commitment no no um well what i do is i work uh i volunteer with the Red Cross and i'm a member of their disaster team oh really and so i pull call once a month to do disaster work such as single family fires and then for national jobs they call me when they need me gosh that must of you must have seen a lot of exciting things and i think that would be good for youth because it would just be an experience that they it would be difficult to get under a lot of circumstances unless you're involved in some kind kind of group right right if you find your niche um you know and and i worked with a lot of of groups that you know have been working to get young people more involved in what we do and um if you can if you can find help them to find their niche you know they'll they'll really grow to love it but if you force them in to something that they're not real keen on they'll rebel on it and at least the ones i've seen you know and and they and they they struggle against it and they want out of it as fast as they can yeah i could see that happening um i i would think with enough publicity there's got to be a wide enough variety of uh groups that they could volunteer with that they if they didn't find their niche in one group if if they're if um-hum groups were enough were publicized enough they could just know what they could know what their options were for other groups to try right and other services to contribute right and something i don't know the Peace Corps signing up and going away i mean i've got a real good support system with my family and such like that you know and and they're the ones that you know i i i think family can make a really big difference in in sticking something out oh absolutely you know and so you know as long as you don't pull them away from their family to to to take them off somewhere to do something you know you've got a better chance of making it work yeah i think the Peace Corps would be uh scary for a lot of people because of that isolation even if they were in teams it would be um-hum a little more conducive i think to a to a fellowship feel in that could they could draw a support from right but i understand that a lot of them are uh well i certainly don't know any statistic but that a lot are are working individually and um i guess that'd be it it i would find i find it hard to imagine maintaining an incentive i or maybe not incentive but uh just keeping a focus on the goal um-hum um-hum well i'd i i had never i didn't know that they were trying to push through a law or anything to make kids do this i that whenever they brought this up that kind of caught me off guard you know i think you know the way i got into mine was they did it it they started it in junior high school and it could just be like an extracurricular club that you could become involved in and you could do as little or as much and you decided how much involvement that you got which you know a lot of people dropped out but we have a lot we have a large number of people that were it was introduced to that way that has stayed with it and had grown with the organization does that make sense yeah i think that does make sense um you'd have to uh i think having having the individual who's volunteering set their own pace um-hum for development in the program would would be key to just staying staying away from that feeling of being forced into it whether they were officially forced into it or just the pressure was so high to stay in or meet a you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh right you know uh but then i think you almost reach a point where if if you pad everything too much it kind of takes away the experience i mean the experience of sacrificing i guess is what i'm thinking um-hum um-hum does making of going overboard overboard overboard almost right well that's true um and and it one other thing you've got to really look at is uh depending on what age group you're going to involve you know be it high school or whatever you've got to have good adult mentors you know because otherwise you get into this situation of you're too young to do any of this yeah  all right well i've been to a couple we've uh we just had one recently for my mom's birthday that all the kids got together all right uh-huh where was that in in Wyoming Sundance where in Wyoming oh i've been through Wyoming but and uh i uh when uh on our way to Montana so that's a bit sure is pretty country up there yeah and we just kind of we kept uh kind of uh it was a surprise birthday party for her was what it was wow how old was she sixty five oh i bet she just uh was pleased oh yeah she she didn't know what was going on or anything oh that's great but my dad had a knew uh what was going on but she didn't and several people in town knew what was going on but they never did tell her so uh that's uh that's that's quite a feat to be able to do that oh yeah because we figured somebody'd probably tell her sooner or later relatively small community it uh it would be pretty easy yeah it so how many folks were up there well we just had uh just immediate family just uh the kids and uh grandkids yeah my well what it was was just huh let's see it was uh just my sisters me and my mom and dad and then uh our kids' oh neat so uh it was pretty good well i bet did you take a lot of pictures yeah we even had some video taken so yeah got all the big eyes and surprises huh oh yeah we had a surprise party uh for uh for my mom once and uh she they're in they're in Lubbock yeah uh she has uh oh about eight or nine grandkids and we hid them all through a friend's house um-hum uh she walked in the room and all of a sudden these grandkids started popping up out of furniture and behind doors and she just uh was speechless for about fifteen or twenty minutes yeah really caught her off guard it's it's really fun to have a have a have uh that sort of uh surprise to family members oh yeah yeah do you have a lot of family in Fort Worth oh no it's it's me and my wife and son oh how uh are you where's your wife from she's from San Antonio uh that uh that's quite uh quite a spread to get uh everybody together it's hard now and days actually oh yeah well we go to you know we go to San Antonio a lot to be with them during like Thanksgiving or Christmas so unless that's kind of our family reunions with them now we uh we have our uh our side of the family really is pretty spread out so we we're we have to uh have a reunion maybe every other year yeah we all uh uh gather uh uh at a place just north of Austin which is fairly convenient for everybody we've got folks from El Paso to Waco to Houston to Dallas so that uh uh trying to trying to make it uh make everybody work a little bit i guess that's the deal that way no one feels like they're being yeah make everybody feel like well you're not at just one person's house so you don't really have to you kind of all stay in in motels and stuff taken advantage of yeah one of the uh one one of the rules is that if you're not at the reunion you have to plan the next one uh-huh that's a pretty so that's that's worked out that that that that brought a lot of people yeah i never thought of that that'd probably work well that uh it it uh it's been successful so far and you know we after the reunion it's uh it's so funny because you'd say well uh we ought to do this twice a year we had so much fun and it it it's too bad you can't yeah yeah you know used to be i guess with uh family reunions where they just sort of came in from the surrounding towns uh uh it was a lot easier but now and days we've got people scattered all over the country and it's that's really tough yeah to get folks together it's not they don't want to but yeah yeah it's that's the problem with us i'm down here and and then i have a sister in New York City ooh and then the rest of my sisters live right around Sundance what brought you uh down from Wyoming uh i'm in the service oh i'm in the Air Force so that kind of how we uh we used to live in Fort Worth actually and we lived over by Carswell and i just love watching those planes come by yeah it's it's it's really pretty well i just before i came here i was stationed in Lubbock yeah yeah i was there for four years and then i got down here  i generally uh prefer to do repairs that i am capable of doing myself if it results in significant money savings yeah um i always used to do the the you know the the fairly simple repairs uh recently i haven't because uh uh time's become more of a premium for me yeah yeah i'm finding that too uh-huh it's also you know it's also getting to the point where i'm sitting there saying well gee unless i am really enjoy doing this this it's costing me more money to do it myself then it would for uh i mean that's the reason i mean it that's right you better you better enjoy doing it or else it's not really worth it right i the last one that that i did myself was i was i found that i was backing out of the garage and i got a little too close to the door on the driver's side i was uh watching too closely on the passenger side i guess and i wasn't paying attention closely enough and i ended up whacking my uh side view mirror off the side of my car which kind of uh made me kick myself yeah the the the other things you always do oh geez shoot yeah but i looked into getting that replaced and that was going to cost a fair amount of money because i would have to take it to the uh dealer who would put a factory replacement part on and then charge me fifty bucks and hour to do the work um-hum and so i figured well i can do that myself i i'll pick up the mirror myself which alone was more money than i wanted to spend on a just a stupid little mirror but it's one of those power ones and it's heated heated and and all that right and i was going on a trip the next day so i figured i'd go out and put the mirror on but i ended up i had to take the whole door apart uh to oh because you couldn't access you couldn't access it yeah to get the cable where the cable plugged in to the uh to the rest of the system was way down in the door right so it ended up being a bitch huh yeah it was more than i really wanted to do and then i got it i finally got it all apart figured out what i had to do and i put the mirror on and i got it plugged in and i put the door back together right and everything was fine i also have power windows and i had to have the window down to do what i was doing and oh no i'm sorry i had to have the window up to do what i was doing and i went to uh no it was down it was down i had to have the window down i went to uh put the window back up it was the middle of winter and the window wouldn't go up because i had the cable yeah so you had a trip that you had to go to the next day in the middle of winter and your window would not come back up all right and no i took the door all apart again and i moved the cable over so it wasn't blocking the window but uh i don't know it used to be fun doing those sorts of things and i don't maybe i'm loosing interest or also cars are getting a lot more complex than they used to be yeah that that's part of the reason why i have cut down also is that uh same reason uh last thing i did was just replace my uh uh light on uh yeah uh-huh you know headlights in the front now that one i you know it actually they actually said to go in and get the service person to do that too and i said well forget that oh yeah yeah uh but and it was kind of a a pain yeah because you uh you you couldn't really fix it without leaving the lights on oh because it i didn't have it doesn't have a uh off yeah it's one of those um uh flipping type headlights oh okay yeah and you so you have to have it up so you have to have the light on right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and it's like not on on some of the some but this one did not uh-huh oh boy no but i figured a way to get around it but it was kind of a really stupid way to have to do it is you is you get it up in the air and then you turn then you take the battery off and then it then it can't bring it back down all right yeah that's one way to do it right and then but then the lights are still out so you're not sitting there going i can't see now i think my mechanic mechanic found a way to do that there's a switch somewhere that you can push that uh pop the light up without turning it on right i don't know where that is on my car because i have the flip up type too um-hum but he did something to make that happen right i mean there there probably is but they didn't bother to tell me so yeah right privileged information that's great uh then that's the other thing is that there always seems to be some really weird tool yeah um-hum and things like you know oil filters every every car now it's so tight in in in the region where where the engines are you can never get to the oil filter yep that's right though though i guess it's getting a little better again because um what they did is first they used to have the big cars and big engines yep then they got the small cars with the not well designed engines now they're redesigning enough that some that to some extent it's it's accessible again but i remember a couple of those cars you know you'd sit there and say right there's no way anyone could get in there unless they could take the car and put it up into the air yep that's right or unless it's high enough off the ground that you can crawl underneath it right yeah but that's not usually easy either and i uh every year you hear somebody gets themselves killed by climbing under a car or under a jack and the only thing you you know i guess you um-hum um-hum  okay well yep i guess if i was going to advise a parent on um well you know maybe how to help their their child choose a college the first thing i'd be interested in is what's the child interested in doing i mean do they have a a a major that they'd want to be interested in you know courses that they'd want to be taking um um-hum and then the second thing i'd probably look at is uh what they can afford um-hum you know in terms of you know how much money do they have or does the child have to pay are there any scholarships or anything that they could uh manage either you know through maybe an open system or maybe from a school itself um-hum and then kind of go from there you know that's kind of where i'd start yeah that's that's uh those are some good thoughts i i found for myself that to start off at a junior college in your local community and find um-hum that way what you do is that you find what topics you're interested in because you really you can project say a you know uh a say um-hum a student out of high school they might think that they have some interests but they haven't explored everything so they don't really know um-hum so if they go to a junior college and and start taking some general education classes and things if they look through the catalog and think they find things that they're interested in um-hum yeah well then they can they really they can really find what they're interests are and then it plus it's also a lot more more inexpensive to do it that way yeah yeah that's true and be and then then then they can choose a college and then they can they can transfer yeah i guess uh the location is um is something you know it's uh whether they want to be close to their family or whether you know uh farther away or something um-hum um-hum i think those are good points i think one thing i might i might differ with or or maybe we would agree on this is that uh i think there's some i think there some kids who who probably don't really know what they want to take right right you they don't have any work experience or whatever maybe they've taken some classes in high school or something like that i think the advice you give is is excellent for that i think on the other hand there are there are student there are students out there who know what they want to take um-hum um-hum and uh i might advise them to jump right in and and find you know a good school that they you know that has good standing uh in that area you know has a good faculty has a good reputation oh sure uh that's what i did sure i knew what i wanted and i was i was i was exactly almost exactly right yeah yeah it just that just helps the decision process when you know what's available because when you're when you're a a kid in school high school and stuff like this is it you're only cognizant of sort of your immediate area environment and surroundings so you just don't know what's there you might just you know like go oh wow that's neat you know um-hum um-hum but another another thing and this is i think is really important is that the college hype okay um-hum and they send this they send these brochures and uh pamphlets and stuff to the the students and you know send us this money and we're going to give you these services and things like that um-hum yeah that isn't so they they're they're they're two horses of of three different colors and i had an experience uh i had to i stayed in the dormitory um-hum um-hum and i they forced you to have a mean plan okay and so you were forced to go to the dining room and um-hum the food was terrible you were you were treated like a second rate human being and the dormitory was hinged on a Nazi concentration camp um-hum okay and you just you just really didn't have any you know any rights and you just just it's just really structure like that and so one of my main suggestions would be to um-hum for the parents to go to the college and just spend some time and talk to people if they want to send their student to the dorm well go to the talk to some people in there you know talk to the people and get the true information because as i said it's it they're just that's just two different things yeah um-hum yeah i knew uh i i think that's a good idea and in general i think it's a good idea to to go to the school i mean once once you've narrowed down right two or to to two or three or whatever number you know go visit the school school you know both the parents and and the student right alright but don't fall for the you know the the student the school tour and and all the hype don't fall for it because that's that's not because once you get in there sometimes you you make these commitments and you're not able to change them you know commitments so yeah um-hum yeah i mean and that's the thing you have to sit down and look at the uh at the individual needs you know i've you know there there some there some students who even as freshmen would be ready to go live in an apartment and and start cooking there own meals and everything but there some who wouldn't be oh exactly exactly i had a very good experience i was in the dorms for three or four out of my four years uh-huh and uh i had a really good dorm experience  you know about computers well i'm sitting in front of one right now you are um-hum yeah i just logged off when i got this call oh well good you can talk about it more than i can i i don't own a computer but um i'm in college right now and uh my boss has an IBM that she has me type letters on a lot and i do a lot of merging with addresses and letters and oh that's basically the only information i have on computers i think i'd it would be good for me to have a laptop computer for for for college oh i see that'd be handy in college but um basically my knowledge is limited huh well so uh what uh word processing program do you use on that machine uh WordPerfect ah okay yeah that's the most popular one uh-huh yeah i use Microsoft Word which is the second most popular one partly because uh oh i i live and work right right near Microsoft and uh it's just real handy to call them up for help or anything kind of a local product uh-huh uh-huh oh so uh yeah they're real handy i got uh got mine a few years ago uh gee maybe it was five i'm not sure but uh-huh what do you do for a living do you use it in that well just for a little bit of typing and stuff i work for i do tech support for a company that makes telephone equipment uh-huh oh and uh so i use it for uh oh memos and for communications uh i have a modem on my uh computer uh-huh i use it for electronic mail and for uh sending faxes oh i i joke around about being a mechanic on the printers i uh i dropped uh one of the paper the paper holder on that that connects to the printer on the floor the other day in my boss's office hum uh-huh and it broke into three pieces it comes in three pieces but it separated and there was there was a little little piece of it that broke off uh oh oh i see did you get it put back together so i panicked called the main office borrowed their's so i could go ahead and print out the the documents hum and then i compared the broken pieces to the good piece the the good paper uh paper holder that was together that i borrowed and put it all back together and huh hum did it take glue did it take glue no no it didn't it it needed it needed uh uh some glue to glue back the broken piece off but it works fine without it so i left a note to my boss am i out of hot water now it just popped apart huh oh well that's good you were probably in a bit of a panic i was i i was panicking i skipped my class to fix that huh so what school do you go to in Texas i go to Tyler Junior College right now in Tyler Texas oh Tyler okay but um i'm interviewing i interviewed i had an i'm i'm a music major and i had an audition yesterday at Baylor University it's a private Baptist Christian School oh really um-hum in Texas in Waco and so uh that went real well well my roommate's a music major oh really and i work with Seattle Opera oh my goodness when i'm not working as an engineer are you so you're into music oh a bit yeah yeah i i actually got into uh opera through an interest in acting but uh i'm getting more interested in singing oh my goodness so uh yeah i'm in about four operas a year up here and we're just i just finished Ballad of Baby Doe that's great uh-huh which was uh written in the early fifties by Douglas Moore uh-huh it's a true story of a uh couple in Colorado in the late eighteen hundreds who became fabulously wealthy from uh silver mining yeah uh but anyway it was a really great show it was kind of like doing it was more like doing a Broadway musical than a an opera it was all in English and it was uh it reminded me of Oklahoma uh-huh right i love that and and then before that i was in uh the Nutcracker with uh Pacific Northwest Ballet i've been doing that for a number of years playing the grandfather in the party scene and then before that i was in Phedalio which is uh the only opera ever written by Beethoven uh-huh oh my goodness so uh it's a lot of fun well well did you take music classes classes in college well i started uh no i didn't um but i've uh started voice lessons recently with uh a woman who's a a principle singer around here for she's in a usually in a couple of operas a year well my goodness that's wonderful i hope well so yes so my roommate Candice in uh uh music department at uh University of Washington and uh she's uh uh doing student teaching right now teaching music in junior high schools uh-huh so does she want to do that or does she want to get into opera i think she wants to do that she also sings in a chorus oh okay see what i'm i want to do is uh get my Bachelor's in music theory possibly music theory and uh if not that then music education um-hum  yes uh i think a lot of the problems whether they be in school or in home in discipline has a part is rooted in the amount of time parents spend with their kids yeah i i don't think parents spend enough time with their kids these days i remember my parents used to help me with my homework and stuff like that you know make sure that i had that i understood what i was trying to study and everything like that now my parents were the same way uh they they took uh interests in everything that i did not just the things that interested them or when they felt like uh i wanted to spend time which was uh uh when they wanted me get out get me out of the door to school in the morning right well we used to take family vacations which i always used to love we'd travel by car to all these different states and uh see these you know really nice things and they were not the typical things like Florida or Disneyland or whatever um-hum was more like Colorado for the mountains or something like that yeah that's essentially what we did uh i look i came from the midwest and we went to the neighboring states to uh little known places that i have yet to find anyone else that's ever been to these places yeah exactly i i'm from the midwest myself from Michigan and we'd we'd go as far as like oh oh places like Colorado we went to Arkansas very frequently and the the biggest thing was that the family did things together you know we didn't just like separate and go our separate ways when we got there um-hum we'd always go out and do things and spend time with each other yeah so i i used to babysit uh the neighbor's kids when i was a lot younger and um it was essentially they'd they'd get home from work the parents would they stick the kids in front of the TV set until it was time to go to bed and never did anything as a family together yeah yep and the kids ended up the losers i think yeah they they became uh brats and juvenile delinquents um-hum the parents just didn't want to really put the time and effort into uh uh its making them making a family unit it was like they were single but they're they were still a a a single people but uh they had kids right the kids were just a nuisance they they got in the way they cost money and they get they're that's the attitude that a lot of people have these days and it's one of the reasons why the kids don't do well in school and don't are carrying guns to school and stuff like that because they don't feel like anybody cares yeah and uh and in some in a lot of cases uh very few or the only the uh only the wrong people care the the people who should care don't um-hum right that's correct um have have you uh have you uh worked around kids quite a bit people at work uh not directly huh no no not not in recent years yeah i haven't worked i haven't worked around kids too much either i used to live in a building that had a day care down in the basement um-hum and i'd go down there and play with some of the kids at times and it was really kind of enjoyable to just they you know they were younger like two and a half to five yeah and um it was enjoyable because they would they liked just liked being with people i mean it really didn't matter what you did with them as long as you did something with them um-hum exactly oh you know let's play with the kitchen or or let's let's play with you know read me a book or you know do something the only problem i had with that and i had i talked to another person who had the same thing when you start actually playing with them you take on the same uh uh sometimes you take on the same mentality of like it's mine and i said wait a minute wait a minute i i'm i'm beyond this and i'm acting just like they are you you speak in simple sentences huh yeah all the words have one syllable do you have a boo boo that doesn't go across very well when you're uh talking to your coworkers right do i have a what you know a boo boo an owie i think i'm going to go to the potty now excuse me oh yeah but uh oh well it sounds like you and i have uh similar opinions on this topic yeah it's it's it's just uh parents today are it's they want everything if if it can't be done in five minutes don't bother me with it yeah yep no attention no attention span um-hum and then especially if it can't be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know right it's the it's the television mentality all problems are created and solved in a half hour yep and uh then you go on to the next set of problems and solve them in a half hour too yep well things just and therefore you have children that um  yeah so what do you think about that um i i have i get frustrated sometimes with our legal system i think it's a bit lenient um giving giving in in most in a lot of cases the the criminal the benefit of the doubt or the i guess the criminal you can't say they're criminal yet but they would be the uh the defendant yeah the accused the accused right and if you um if you require the jury to be unanimous i'm afraid there'd there'd be a lot of there'd be a lot of cases where just a single person is being stubborn and um and someone would would get off when they really shouldn't yeah i hear that the uh my problem with the courts and the that systems is just the fact that it's almost completely broken down most cases that go on aren't even tried but are plea bargained so that the guy can get off a certain amount of time in exchange for not spending time in the courts but the uh the worst part is that the jails are being filled with political criminals i mean since nineteen eighty six we've been undergoing a major witch hunt in this country were the question isn't who's hurt anybody but uh is the individual has been engaged in unauthorized behavior and we are now ahead of South Africa and Russia in locking up a higher percentage of our citizens than any other country on this planet we've beat even beat out the Muslim countries something is major wrong here and uh we can trace it to the right wing witch hunt there isn't any room for the real criminals what what's a political criminal uh it's when uh the government decides that a certain behavior uh shall not be authorized anymore and that anybody who is then caught doing it is guilty of violating the crime like what when in fact nobody has actually been hurt oh smoking weed growing marijuana patronizing prostitutes things like that oh i see okay you're calling them political prisoners well that as as as opposed to the kind of the more European political prisoners where someone actively uh speaks out and opposes the government if if if if a crime involves no complainant then it's the government doing the complaining and that sounds political to me okay yeah i understand i uh actually actually for my perception is that most people having having to do with those things you mentioned seems like they tend to get off most of the time i don't really have a lot of data but that's my perception um it depends on what and who uh the largest number of people who are convicted of various crimes and in jail today are drug crimes that are not accompanied by other crimes it's sort of a thing that because someone who is inclined to use some of the nastier drugs will then also go out and commit other crimes that that means that the other crimes are no longer a valid point of contention it's sort of like saying somebody should be able to do all the Coke they want but as soon as they violate any other law and actually hurt somebody whether it's stealing money to get the Coke loosing control and beating someone up that they should be treated the same way as someone who looses control and beats someone up without being under the influence of chemicals whose they can't use it as an excuse i certainly agree but the way that it's come now to the the trials and the judges it's it's it's almost completely manipulated uh in in favor of the government's position so uh while i'm willing to sacrifice the danger of having a a few people who are guilty getting off because it's far to easy when the government decides someone did it hey they did it and if it and whether the innocence or guilt is true or not becomes irrelevant in fact Texas has gone totally crazy on this Texas has a guy on death row now and the convicted convicted of a crime that someone else has come out and admitted to and that story has been corroborated but they're still arguing whether that's grounds for uh commuting his sentence or not because guilt or innocence is not a constitutional question so Texas could conceivably it's that close execute someone who they know didn't commit the crime because of the points of law involved so there there's a point that's left logic and reason and broken down completely huh what do you think do you think the jury ought to do the sentencing or the judge oh the jury definitely and uh whether it's unanimous or not i think that it could be uh there there there needs to be lots of evidence for appealing um i have a friend who uh took his trial by judge and that's the worst mistake anyone can ever make because at least with the jury even though you're going to be tried by six or twelve people who weren't able to get out of jury duty that's an old joke but it's still true a lot of the people who you would want to have on your jury don't want to have anything to do with it uh-huh so it's risky real risky but still i take my chance with the odds of twelve and we have to sacrifice letting a few people get away with things because eventually they're going to be caught then for my personal risk of being in the wrong place at the wrong time yeah i disagree i actually disagree on both of them  i've got some pretty firm feelings on this one and that is that we are definitely not getting our money's worth um primarily uh i think the one big thing that stands out among all this is uh the amount of money that our taxes go to to pay for interest on the federal deficit which is just an absolute inexcusable waste um-hum it's about uh twenty percent of the federal budget isn't it at this moment it's terrible you know it's huge i have no idea what the actual number is but it but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and not at this point in the business cycle you can't yeah i think that the people that um orchestrated this and engineered our having the deficit should have appreciated you know what it was ultimately going to cost it was a very bad decision to start letting that grow yeah yeah i would agree with that it was we were actually in twenty years ago we were not in bad shape we had we had been in pretty bad shape after World War Two and then we paid off some of the debt of or at least we inflated it away which is probably more what happened and uh then at the end of the Johnson Administration the budget Nixon's first year that was that was uh set up by Johnson was balanced and that was the last balanced budget we've got well of course part of the problem is that that um hum the federal government just grows and it seems like that the only way to restrain it is to restrain the increase in taxes if taxes are increased uh the government finds a way to spend it even you know given even that despite the fact that we have a budget deficit yeah absolutely i think what we really need to do is concentrate more on reducing waste on assuring that government be efficient you know we need more programs where people get rewarded for money saving suggestions we yeah absolutely and that's that's a terrible problem as well we need more programs to well i mean for example a tax reform law okay a so called tax reform of nineteen eighty six began as a tax simplification law which would've made it easier to enforce and would've saved us i mean another way that they in effect increase your taxes is by increasing the amount that you have to pay to get them prepared or the amount of time you need to take to get your records in order um-hum um-hum and the eighty six tax reform well just made it more complicated even though it started as a simplification bill if i were Ronald Reagan i would've said unless that reduces the size of the IRS code by thirty percent i'm going to veto it well as much as that's a bad thing i think that uh there's some other really major major things that need straightened out and you'd mentioned waste a little while ago um-hum and uh i've seen with my own eyes a tremendous amount of government waste i was in the marine corps and we had uh several hundred thousand dollars worth of transformers sitting on the wall that had been contracted out to be built as replacement parts for an old Westinghouse Radar Westinghouse wasn't going to support it anymore and Spencer you know Spencer Gifts that company said they'd go ahead and build these things and they didn't build them to specifications so they were unusable they were too physically large to go back in and we spent um four thousand dollars apiece on those things and there they just sat there taking up valuable space in front of everybody and they were there the whole time i was down there another thing that that that that reminds me of is um I was talking to people who work at AT&T Gilford Center uh-huh and they have a government contract to do work on some computer for the Navy i'm not sure what it's called called but it's some uh military standard architecture with a with a sixteen bit address space i mean they're still working with a sixteen bit address space uh no and they're writing all their software to overlay programs into this sixteen bit address space rather than going to something that was you know modern fifteen years ago i don't know how much it costs them to maintain that outdated software but you'd think at some stage they'd get the get the idea that it it it pays to get to be more current yeah i really wish there was some solution to this bureaucratic obesity that just seems to be prevalent in every sort of administration or administrative thing that gets so big well the Republican solution is to cut taxes and i uh that may prevent it from getting worse but it doesn't solve it we haven't gotten our budget back into any better balance if it had not been for the savings and loan debacle at least it would have remained the same as a result it's gotten worse but uh um not limiting taxes didn't hasn't stopped uh the government from spending they just went ahead and spent it and now we've got this giant deficit on top of things that's right that's right um so i i i don't know i mean there there there's only three things you can do you you can you can cut programs you can raise taxes or you can cut waste and at the moment people don't want programs cut although uh i'm not sure that some of them shouldn't be looked at more carefully programs uh uh and i think of of programs you know when you when uh uh like the the um aid to families with dependent children that appears to create an incentive for unmarried women to have more kids uh i'm a little concerned about that i'm a little concerned about cutting it out too because they might just end up aborting all of them uh-huh uh-huh but uh there there there you know Governor Thompson of Wisconsin has an idea which is pay the fathers of these children to marry the mothers and at least that way you get you get the mother you know the fathers to take up some of the some of  i think i'm probably somewhere around a five on the scale they gave uh um i don't like the idea of you know anyone being able to just sort of go up to a store and buy a hand gun for about uh you know forty dollars or whatever and go out and shoot someone but i also think that uh hunting is a legitimate use for weapons and uh i also sort of believe that although you know certainly our government is is very nice now it it probably doesn't hurt this sort of ultimate back up to have some some citizens to have guns if for some reason something ever happened and our government was run by someone who decided to make it non democratic well that's a very farfetched and you know sort of you know paranoid if you will possibility but you know it i guess it's it's i think it's it's always sort of a bad idea when the only people that have guns are the military and the police since well you're right there and uh i just think they should have a little more restriction on who buys guns yeah i mean i i instead of just being able to walk into a store and buy a gun they should have a waiting period yeah i agree completely there should be a waiting period and they should be able to do a background check on you exactly and i and as far as hunting i'm sure you know this is the same thing and if if you are a a you know a legitimate hunter or you just need a handgun or something like that a two week or three week wait period is not going to make any difference yeah i mean most yeah i agree completely if your criminal and you need a gun for that night it's going you know it's going to make you a little bit mad yeah yeah yeah but they should you know they should have some kind of restrictions and i think everybody should have to have a permit they don't require everybody to have a permit yeah yeah and i think they should if you're going to have a gun you need to to you know register it and and have a legitimate reason as to why you have it yeah that's a reasonable and it i i don't even think they do that in Texas do they yeah uh i don't think so i don't think so either you need a permit to carry a concealed handgun i think in some states i think Texas might be one of those but to just carry you know one in the open or whatever is no problem uh-huh um-hum um yeah although i one thing is i think no matter what rules you set unless you sort of had uh good enforcement of it it wouldn't matter i mean the types of people that cause trouble with handguns aren't the sort to care what the law is anyway that's true um and i'm sure they would certainly attempt to buy them on the black market so you'd need uh you know a good method of ensuring that they weren't available there which given the success or rather lack there of of the police in controlling the market in drugs i sort of wonder uh you know really how effective it would be but i don't i don't mean that i know it'd just make it it would make it harder for them to get them but they still could but yeah yeah i mean i don't mean it as an argument to not have waiting periods and that sort of thing but i just you know i just i think it's something to be aware of that it probably would not be the the ultimate solution that would solve all crime problems but you're right they're always gonna yeah hum-um because they're always going to be able to get them um yeah uh do you do you have any sort of you know real real life experience with uh you know either people owning guns or people being uh you know assaulted with uh guns or anything like that no not not really my my daddy was always a hunter so we always had rifles or shotguns or things around the house but you know he was responsible with those and yeah yeah um there was never an accident or anything like that and we've never been robbed or mugged or anything like that yeah my dad hunted when he was young although he didn't um by the time i came along so we didn't we didn't have guns in in our house he left them at uh his parents house so you know i got to see them or whatever um-hum but uh i do uh uh another student who i didn't know personally at Rice uh but uh it's not that small that uh large a community about a week ago uh was shot in the head with a gun yeah um he was you know going home sort of late at night after studying and uh oh my goodness you know robbers said you know i guess he was on a motorcycle and he had a his motorcycle helmet on which saved his life um because my oh my goodness they said you know we want your money you know we have gun or whatever so he was like okay here have my money you know i'll lie on the ground i'll do whatever you say i'll i'm not going to put up any fight whatsoever and uh apparently there were two guys and one of them was really kind of jumpy and the other seemed kind of uh relaxed so he said to the relaxed guy hey you know please tell your friend not to shoot me you know but uh apparently the other guy for whatever reason uh shot him anyway oh my goodness and uh thanks to the fact his his motorcycle helmet was made out of Kevlar which is the same thing that bullet proof vest are made out of and so uh you know he was shot in the head but he was unharmed you know i mean i think i think he might've gone to the hospital anyway just to you know be looked at but oh oh my goodness um he didn't even have a concussion or or anything like that oh how frightening but uh so it's kind of scary it really is living at um Houston's got a lot of crime but they you know and they have when my sister when she was going to the University of Texas she had  um i find that my main source of information on current events is conversations with other people i often find myself going oh is that right i didn't realize that it happened yesterday oh really so you do you uh don't pay attention to uh primary sources no not not on a regular basis like TV or oh that's interesting yeah i uh have frequently decided just that i would just go ahead and read a paper every day but i haven't really done it as often as i i intended what about television um i just don't watch much television i'm usually i usually don't get home until after the evening news is over and i'm usually in bed by the time the late news starts um-hum but i um i do watch some TV and and sometimes there'll be if it's some big news with like with the primaries and things like that they would run little banners across the bottom of the TV screen what about the gulf war um i i worked with a guy who was in the who had just gotten out of the army and he told me he kept me up to date on what was going on um how do you keep up on current events oh well i'm pretty much of a space cadet a zombie i really don't know much what's going on uh i guess most mostly of what i get is from the news from the excuse me from the newspaper i don't have a television so that doesn't help do you feel like you keep up sufficiently i mean are you as caught up with it as you'd like to be um i get a daily newspaper and um i think newspapers are better then television for in depth news they uh the television uh actually is good in uh uh particularly when we're you're talking about personalities because you can get a heck of a lot more through uh complete audio visual presentation like for example in the political debates and what not right than you do through distilled string of words uh in the newspaper but actually for indepth information the newspaper newspaper is definitely better uh because the television just presents highlights and doesn't really go much indepth can't really because they don't have the time right right i guess i'd have to agree with you i hadn't really though of that but i certainly seems seems and when i'm on airplanes i will use i will read news news magazines uh that my son likes news magazines but uh i i guess i just never get around to reading them right it's sort of a tradition to read the newspaper over breakfast but is that what you do yeah read your newspaper over breakfast and yeah sort of of sort of a relaxing time well yeah um do you listen to the radio much nope nope i think radio is in our house more of a source for music in quotes yeah i don't i don't listen to the radio but my son does of course he's thirteen and his idea of music is not quite the same as my idea of music um yeah i get i get a little bit of news from the radio just they'll have hourly updates on some news caps oh yeah well when i'm driving in the car that's right sometimes uh well driving in the bay area is risky in the since that you may run into uh traffic problems uh-huh so i will tune in to news uh station where they give every ten minutes they give traffic information and uh as a sort of a side effect i get news that way right um i would think even the traffic i think of the traffic updates as news also just because there i guess they qualify as a current event well i guess you're right nothing more current than uh uh nothing more current and nothing more news worthy than uh traffic problems if at least not if you're a driver right so uh i didn't even think about that i guess um i would think that would be probably on a i guess as a percentage of the population that would keep up with something i bet the traffic conditions is probably number one um-hum well it's a beautiful day here in uh California i'm standing outside of a phone booth you know when you call in you're supposed i guess you're supposed to call from different numbers so oh i call from a bunch of uh pay phone pay phones and whatnot so the news the news the current event news in California is that we had rain yesterday and uh it's sort of a cloudy i would say broken skies mostly almost not quite overcast but almost overcast and uh that's your current current event news cast from um  going to talk about clothing and how we dress for work yes i must admit i'm pretty boring i just wear some uh you know old dress pants and a button down shirt just about every single day uh-huh well i'm sure that you select different colors everyday and your shoes probably you you have you rotate your shoes around oh the shoes are just about the only thing that doesn't get rotated okay like brown with um if you wear black with brown pants yeah well i just wear blue gray and black blue gray and oh okay you just what else is there there's another color dark gray that's it they're gray okay so you don't have to worry about the shoes then i do once in a while i wear brown but uh-huh what can you do right well i mean i think men look very nice i i think that they're much better off than women are as far as their clothes go because i think um i think um uh and it's true that uh you know men are attracted by what they see and of course the women always um either she's pleasing her boyfriend or she's pleasing her mate or she is looking for a a husband and she of course in the work field if she's single she dresses you know i don't dress for um i dress for myself i always like to look nice i want to look uh professional and so i i make an a big effort to do that okay you that that that that agrees with what most women tell me is that they dress to please themselves and you know who cares what these other people think and you know they have their own idea of what looks good uh-huh well and there's some that really are on target and then there's some that are kind of way out in left field i don't appreciate the real short dresses and uh and then to sit sprawl legged i think that's very offensive and um i don't know how they feel about it but it surely doesn't uh i think i think even the men uh men are offended by that too if it's not you know if you're out in public and you're you don't watch how you sit i think that's very um inappropriate for uh a lady to act like that where what sort of a do you work in an office or yes i do yes i do i work in an office and is it pretty well integrated as far as are you know positions of power or you know where i work just about every woman is a secretary uh-huh except for two and uh yeah it's pretty there are no male secretaries so there it's pretty much like that where i work i was very offended by one of the young ladies who is a secretary and plus she's a mother by what she wore and it looked like she just had and she's she's very lean you know it's a very lean girl but she really offended me by her dress i mean it was like she forgot to dress it was like she was wearing uh um golly how do i want to phrase that it looked like sweat suits or something yes a wet suit you know i thought that is not the appropriate attire for an office environment you think it was distracting i yeah because everybody was turning their heads sure enough everybody you know everybody you know you just take a double look and they'll say is that really what she's wearing yeah that's really what she's wearing okay well okay so so she wasn't just floppy and like put on some loose floppy stuff you know cotton uh weave thing not knit something oh oh no no no she yeah something that you'd wear doing doing the garden maybe uh no it was yeah i thought what is this now definitely designed to catch the eye yes it was it was definitely designed if you could see almost every fold of her body so i thought that was very offensive and i i made a loud remark about it in fact i complained to my supervisor about it and he agreed and she has never worn it since hey but i think you have to take some action like that maybe she didn't realize you know how she came across some people are oblivious as to what kind of reactions they can cause yeah well right or perhaps  music yeah music huh always an interesting topic oh yeah i uh i have a little bit of an interesting experience with music i've been a part-time disc jockey uh so oh wow work for a a company a little company in Virginia that does uh DJ stuff for weddings and uh birthdays and things like that um-hum so we've uh we've had to play quite a bit of of music uh over the past several months so it's interesting to see what people like and that sort of thing are you involved at all in music or uh um uh uh a strong appreciator of it um yeah i i did the typical piano thing back uh when i was young and i even played trombone in band for a number of years um-hum hum ah hum um but i don't actively uh play anymore i just listen and spend too much money on discs yeah um-hum right yeah it's interesting now there all going to uh CD's now also um-hum i uh have a little bit of an involvement in uh in square dancing and and round dancing and that's all all all still on forty fives and uh so they're they're having an interesting problem when it comes to the music for that because the uh the forty fives are generally played on a variable speed turntable so you can speed it up or slow it down for the dancers um-hum so now they're wondering how they're going to do that with CD's it's going to be a little tougher if if it ever goes to CD's it's not it hasn't converted over yet i think the only group of folks who even use forty fives for music anymore um yeah yeah that's interesting yeah i think that even the aerobics people are using uh all their music is on cassettes or CD's yeah yeah well that you know technically it shouldn't be difficult to uh modulate the the speed on a compact disc yeah um-hum right yeah i should be able to and cassettes i know that they do have some that are variable speed um-hum uh i think those are machines for for aerobic instructors um so uh and uh i found that uh at least at the things i've DJed people like things they can dance to if you can get them to dance um-hum it's kind of the hard part uh at these parties they tend to want to sit around or stand around and talk or uh drink and talk or whatever and yeah um-hum and then getting them to dance and then they they have different taste in dance music some of them like the fast stuff and some the slow right we're kind of uh into oldies right now in our in our family for some reason we're most of what we listen to is oldies hum-um um-hum so and yourself you you just mostly listen then yeah yeah yeah um i guess i'm towards the uh other end of the spectrum um i listen to a lot of uh hum hum techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music um-hum hum uh-huh um so huh it's kind of the other end of the spectrum for you yeah i got uh some albums i've picked up that i've kind of recently gotten interested in it's uh the uh African music um um-hum uh there's a a group that Paul Simon has uh featured uh well on his album Graceland right right it's called Lady Smith Black Membazo right and they're a uh African uh group that sings a cappella um-hum and um yeah they're a very good group um-hum much of their music is sung in Zulu in the Zulu language so that's uh um-hum it's a an interesting and uh i guess it kind of falls into the i guess the reggae category uh whatever that is i'm not quite sure what reggae is actually yeah yeah that that um that's that's more like Bob Marley and the Whalers um a lot of the other Jamaican uh groups it's so it's a strongly Jamaican based music um-hum ah ha uh-huh hum um but it it it's interesting too i'm not terribly familiar with with reggae itself i know it's influenced a lot of of stuff especially some of the more modern dance stuff they take a lot of the more complicated rhythm structures um-hum um-hum uh from reggae and try to translate that into uh more current hits you ever hear of a musical from called Zydeco i had never heard of it before um i've heard of it but i couldn't give you a definition of it um-hum we had uh what were we doing we were DJing a uh i think it was a company party and they had gotten a request for some of that so i did a little research on it it's uh Louisiana um-hum the uh French uh Cajun music oh okay okay yeah yeah and that's that's called Zydeco i'd never heard of that term before and uh and i i was able to listen to a few tapes from the library of of what it was like and it was definitely different Cajun type music i'd never actually even heard it before um-hum um-hum yeah
