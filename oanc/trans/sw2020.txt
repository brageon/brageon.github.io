 uh what is the last home repair that you did oh gosh i'm trying to think well i guess ours have mostly been down at our lake house we built a house built a house down on Cedar Creek Lake um-hum so i guess i'd have to say that because we've kind of let this house go oh so we had a shell built and then we did everything else um-hum so it was quite a bit of work yeah what have you done well uh repaired the back fence it's uh well of course they get old you know after about ten years anyway but uh oh yeah ours is nineteen years old yeah the the street the alley's on a kind of a slant uh-huh and it makes all the fences tilt or or slowly you know oh do you have to have like a retaining wall or yeah somewhat right yeah that makes them more difficult we we've just my husband has just um repaired repaired ours a lot it really needs to be replaced but we haven't done it um-hum but uh anyway well have you done anything else um had to replace the the ridge row the shingles on the corners of the the roof from all the storms and everything um-hum um-hum yeah and uh yeah i you know i'm wondering myself now why i checked this one because my husband is who does all the things like what you're talking about right yeah i haven't done those things and of course you know inside stuff but um now down at the lake we had to like put in floors and put in wall and you know do the painting and the uh cut and make the like the uh window sills and things around the door and all that kind of stuff you know so we we did quite a bit um-hum uh down there that i had never done or we haven't done that much in our own house weather proofing and yeah yeah uh we do have still have a problem down there we built us a two story house and the bottom story uh oh it's more like walk out basement yeah uh-huh and when it was built with these blocks you know these old gray blocks i think they're called Hadite blocks yeah and uh we found now with some as much rain as we've had the past year it seeps through those blocks and comes into the downstairs and uh so now we have bought some uh what's uh uh water proofing paint um-hum and that's our next project the next time we go down there we've got to paint all those block walls downstairs with this waterproof paint and then hope that maybe that will do it but what they should've done i think is they should have put plastic or something like that against the house before they put the dirt back you know when it was built right and uh they didn't do that didn't think they'd need to and then that it's that it's that white paint i've forgotten what it's called Tight Bond or something like that and those bricks are very porous yeah and it soaks in to those bricks really well and it seals all the water out oh have you ever used that anywhere just a little bit now people up north that have basements i think yeah they use it all the time you and do you know if it if they've had good luck with it yeah it seals the water out we had a hard time even finding it down here in fact you know you go in a store and they say oh well that we don't have anything like that you know right uh-huh and then finally found some one somewhere that was familiar with it probably lived in the North um-hum and well that's encouraging then because i haven't known that many you know there's just not many basements down here are you from around here yeah right yeah i'm from Dallas oh okay well we're from you know Texas too so but uh uh-huh uh but i we have a partner in this deal and he's from the North so he was the one that and it gave us a lot more space you know it gave us double the space right and toward the lake it looks like a two story house you know because it gradually the back it looks like a one story house you know um um-hum yeah and it's set into the earth so uh-huh built kind of into a hill a little hill you know um-hum so it was a good idea to give us a lot more space for the money right uh-huh we just uh hadn't solved our water problem yet yeah but we always  okay Carolyn what kind of dress do you have to wear when you go to work uh i can actually wear anything i want to however i generally wear uh suits or dresses yeah how about you uh well in my company we do have to dress up and they don't say that you have to um dress in a dress for women but they strongly urge it so it's it's kind of an unwritten law well the company that i work for uh we it's very casual we don't see any people there's a plant out in the back and then i'm in the office section and we always had casual day on Friday which meant you could wear jeans or whatever you wanted to which to me dressing down is you know like wearing pants and a jacket or something right but uh even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up exactly it's puts puts forth a better image it's uh my company doesn't usually have casual days we had our first one in four at least since i've been there which is four years not too long ago and i didn't feel comfortable dressing like many people came in like warm ups and no and i you're kidding that's casual yeah and i don't feel i i wore you know a nice pair of pants and and blouse but i i i just couldn't feel comfortable in my warm ups around everybody at work uh-huh would i assume that perhaps they did that one time and that was it oh well it was just recently so i don't know if they'll do it again the way some people looked i would doubt it well that's what i always thought actually uh the gals in our customer service department quite honestly came in every day in what i considered casual but um-hum i don't know i it just seems if you want to get ahead or even if you just want everybody to think of you you know as a a professionally you you don't just want to have the real casual look all the time um-hum do you work for a large company well we've got two hundred people in our office but we're the corporate office so um it's it's relatively large but i mean i have a job very much longer so i i don't want to say too much well and it and it affects uh you know being in the corporate office how you have to dress too do you exactly we have to hold the image for everybody do you tend to dress up toward your superiors as the books kind of i would like to you know i dress as nicely as my budget allows i understand and and you know i mean it's it's a lot better than some people there and it's not as nice because i don't have the money of others you know what about you um-hum uh i have never i really have not worked for very many companies that i had a female role model uh-huh um the we have some i'm sure in our corporate office but i've not met them yet but uh the last few jobs i've had well there was two jobs ago there was a girl in the office uh that i tended to try to emulate somewhat but uh um-hum so you don't work with many women no not too many and i work with all women i've do you really and my husband does well not all but the majority and my husband he works in a bank and he works with all women majority i'm sure that's true i used to be in banking and you're right the majority of the people there yeah at least at the lower levels you know uh exactly what oh someone never mind that's a call coming in but okay we'll pass that what about season to season do you change um i probably get a little bit more casual in summer in then in that i would wear a more casual top under some of my suits um-hum than i would wear in the winter um-hum but our offices are rather cold so i i'll tend to try to dress warmly too exactly i i do the same and that's what basically keeps my wardrobe i may wear a few really warm dresses in the winter but i don't i don't change a whole lot because it's it's we're environmentally controlled you know you end up wearing the same thing well tell me another thing uh how do you wear your skirt lengths below the knee i i i don't have nice knees they're kind of knobby so on the knobby side i what about you well i they go from everywhere to just like halfway up the knee to uh mid calf uh-huh halfway up the knee you must have better not halfway not halfway up my leg halfway up my knee oh okay okay my half of my knee might oh okay i i i'm thinking halfway between the knee and your say your hip uh and my i'm a little too old for that for one thing and it's terribly unprofessional well it that it is but i know a lot of women who who do wear those skirts and they have been reprimanded in our company before really yeah also i was going to just mention that i wear what you know my my wardrobe my wardrobe how should i say it i wear what i can fit into you mean you have fat days and thin days oh yeah fat months thin months you know well right now i'm having a fat month i know half of my clothes don't fit me since the holiday season exactly the same for me but i'm working on it but i'm not doing a very good job at this point i haven't gotten serious yet well we have to get all of this junk food out of the house from Christmas that's right that's right but i'm so used to eating now it's hard to get out of the habit well  well how do you feel about um putting an elderly family family member in a nursing home i'm not too happy about the idea although i do realize that sometimes it becomes necessary to do that or to have round the clock kind of health care available in the house uh-huh which often is is not that um easy to to do sometimes it really is easier to put the person right in the central place where the care can be given um-hum i'm very happy that in my life so far i have not had to do that kind of a thing um my own mother lived with us for some years and uh just died peacefully within a short amount of time at the end of her life and uh i never had to face that personally um-hum um-hum and uh what do you think you might do in such a situation yeah oh i agree i it's it's a tough issue i feel like each case probably has to be evaluated individually i feel um um-hum um-hum i i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families um-hum and yet i understand um well we may be facing that with my grandmother she lives is living near my parents out in California oh and they this year they moved her into a um retirement apartment complex so she's got part time care oh yes but as soon as she needs round the clock care then she's not allowed to live there anymore and so we'll have to face the issue of whether she moves in with my mother or they put her into a nursing home and i see um-hum it's it's difficult because i know my mother feels really um torn about it she doesn't want to to put her in a place where she's gonna be unhappy lonely or where there's bad care and sometimes you just don't know what the the place is like um uh-huh i mean you really need to get recommendations i guess from others and um and yet it's a real burden to her to have to to be there all the time or else you know or else like you said you have to hire someone to be in the home it's a tough issue that's right um-hum yeah people are just not as home as much as they used to be um sometimes persons are still working and are not retired yet and yeah um and therefore uh they have to leave the older person all the by themselves or with the care of somebody else and some of the diseases that uh older people have uh do require more intensive surveillance um-hum um-hum so uh it it isn't easy i suppose one of the um-hum uh best things if you are considering a nursing home is to inquire among friends and get personal recommendations i know i always trust the opinion of a close friend uh above just what i might read about a place if somebody i knew and cared about liked a place and said no this was good and yeah we were happy about the personnel and the care et cetera and so forth i would it certainly would go up in my estimation um-hum and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum um-hum yeah i uh i was thinking you know it might i guess i would want to visit the place quite a bit before or something and and talk to the staff see what their attitudes are talk to some of the people that live there and see how they feel about being there um-hum um because i've been in different nursing homes where i've sensed different atmospheres you know often it's it's been negative where the and i know that partly it can be the attitude of the person if they they feel neglected by their family or whatever or they just feel ready to die and you know tired of feeling not feeling good all the time um-hum um um-hum yeah then they're not gonna feel too good but then i've i've been to other places where you know the people have told me um this is a really good place the people here really care about us so um-hum um-hum yeah well there's hope i guess uh has uh your grandmother always lived in California yeah yeah well no um but all the years that i've been alive she has um for the last thirty years or so oh i see yeah yeah what part of California is that it's Central California oh i see we used to live out there in the San Jose area so uh you know i'm kind of familiar with the state of California and like it very much yeah yeah uh-huh yeah well this is Fresno uh-huh but um uh it's uh it's a difficult situation uh sometimes also when you get involved in the in those residences for the elderly the retirement homes and and also uh maybe even the nursing division of a residence home um it's tremendously expensive and sometimes they ask you to uh um-hum  okay yeah right um we have small children two and four and so we our dining is very limited oh we're past that now we're a little sick of that uh-huh i bet you're a McDonald's fan are you gosh where do you go Whataburger no um we're more like um you know like Wyatt's Cafeteria oh is that right yeah that way and the kids just love everything that's there so we're pretty fortunate kind of um buffet style um so you can go in and go out and the food's already served and you don't have to wait and yeah that's that's good and it's already in front of them when you sit down and things like um Super Salads you know it's again it's buffet and it's already prepared and just things any any eating area that you just don't have to wait uh an extremey amount of time i can understand that we've had we got three kids too and uh when the kids are small if you're gonna wait you don't go out we no they won't put up with that stuff we tried a Bennigan's one time and it was terrible course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyways we we waited almost oh forty five minutes before everything was brought out and it was we were ready to go home uh and you and you had your kids with you and they waited forty five minutes yeah no we fought with them for forty five minutes i don't doubt that one bit yeah so we we we rarely go eat in those kind of eating uh situations any more but we do love to eat out and um and we do it as often as we can and and times that we do have baby sitters we we try and catch um some things that we normally wouldn't do yeah where where do you like to go when you got a baby sitter oh um let me see uh for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's where's that i never heard of that place it's um on Walnut and Greenville what's the name of that again it's called Uncle Julio's what what are the what kind of food um basically Mexican food and it's supposed to be very similar to um uh what is that restaurant off of Central it's a yeah okay um it's a Mexican restaurant off of Central like oh there's a zillion of them you ever been to Mercado Juarez no but i've heard about it that's a good place i they got one in Addison too now but the original was on Northwest Highway uh just the other side west of Loop Twelve that's a good Mexican place good good prices good good food there really really um-hum yeah if you like Mexican stuff it's it's a good place we like um seafood also you you you ever been to Vincent's and um Vincent's no we haven't that's a good seafood place yeah really really you ever been tried a place called Louisiana Purchase no well this is in Plano they might have another one but it's on uh Parker and Central Expressway uh-huh and you know it's it's Cajun yeah it's Cajun type stuff if you like it kind of hot that that is good food that's good stuff okay i've seen it yeah yeah we've been to um Chefalia's that's it's basically the same thing seafood Cajun style yeah where's that place that's in Addison off of Belt Line yeah okay Belt Line and what i get over Midway like around i think it's a little past or it's right before Midway or it's right at Midway okay yeah okay and um excellent food um-hum so we got this Premier Dining Card thing and we've we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it what what is that well you get uh one free and you you you pay for one now and type thing and oh really uh oh we've been to from barbecue to there's a Swan Club which is off Central and Campbell uh-huh uh that is if you like continental stuff that is really nice talk talk your husband into taking you there some night i mean it's not a cheap place but uh it's very nice you know uh-huh really and where is that uh it's on Campbell it it's north of Campbell but uh off Central uh uh-huh oh it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the basement in the ground floor i don't know what they call it now Northern Telecom kind of moved over in their own building but it it's a big tall it's tallest building on the west side northwest side of Campbell and just before you get to Campbell yeah uh-huh and it's in the lower floor but really a nice restaurant if you if you like Continental stuff really uh-huh have him tell him to take you there for your anniversary and then they got a place where you can dance you know and all that kind of stuff yeah well my birthday's coming up so there you go all right you got one coming i need an excuse you ever been to Ewaldes now there's if you like Continental i I like Continental stuff myself my wife doesn't necessarily like that stuff but i i like that uh-huh uh-huh and that's down in uh the Stoneleigh Hotel now uh-huh and that is really super kind of stuff too take if if you like Continental at all i mean and that kind of stuff either one of those two you go through a hundred bucks without half trying but it it's it's it's nice really nice place oh you don't have to spend that much i'm kidding you yeah yeah oh yeah but i mean  what was the topic uh just about um it would be interesting to discuss the social changes of the last ten or twenty years i said uh right right yeah and um i guess for me the most obvious is women in the work field well that's a good one i hadn't thought about that yeah that uh of course when i was growing up not very many women went to work at all most everyone was at home yeah really and some of my friends whose mothers were teachers or something seemed a little bit embarrassed that their mothers weren't at home uh oh there there was a stigma attached to it yes and uh but nowadays it's just so common and and a necessity a necessity and that when i am uh at home now that i've had children i've stopped uh working yeah that it's kind of embarrassing when i go to a store and they ask uh when i write a check out and then they say can i have your work number please and then i don't have a work number to get give to them and they begin to think um i wonder if this is a good check uh-huh yeah really i well i hadn't thought about it i can see i i think if they asked me for a work number i'd just write down my home number you know because that's where you work uh-huh right yeah well the thing that i was thinking about uh huh you know social changes i i thought well you know in a lot of different ways i i think number one just the the makeup of American society how much it's changed i mean uh uh i live in Houston but i'm i'm in Miami right now on business and uh i mean in Miami it's i mean honestly English is almost a second language now um-hum yes uh you know with all the uh influx of uh South Americans and uh Cubans and the the Latins are are just uh i i guess a majority in Miami you know of course in Houston uh you've got the people from Mexico so that's certainly a change in the the fabric of society uh that's true the other thing that i was thinking about uh the way that things have changed so dramatically is twenty or thirty years ago uh you know air travel was still uh and not that much in the forefront uh uh and and now i mean it's you know hardly anybody thinks anything about getting on a plane and and going cross country uh-huh right plus the other thing i was thinking about was just the very fact that we're doing what we're doing tonight uh you know calling a one eight hundred number having a computer hook us up uh tell us the topic of conversation uh and and we take that rather for granted um-hum um-hum right uh you know thirty years ago uh a long distance phone call was a sort of a special event yes that's true and and and you know and it wouldn't be uncommon for it to have been placed through an operator up i don't know if you know i guess you maybe they did have one plus dialing uh in nineteen sixty one but uh i i'm not sure of that right no and it wasn't like my parents always watch the clock carefully when they make any long distance phone call and it's it's pennies but for them it's just a socialized behavior oh yeah that's right and it harks back to the days like i say when when a long distance call was an expensive uh uh i don't want to say a frivolous but it was an extravagant uh event um-hum um-hum and good grief if my parents knew what my long distance bill was every month they'd have a stroke that's true that's probably true but you know it's something that i've just i mean i factor that in i mean that's that's part of my budget i mean i expect to have you know a seventy or eighty dollar phone bill and quite frankly am pleased if it's anything below that um-hum right me too yeah well that's good in in in our homes we all have a lot uh much more high tech compared to the people ten twenty years ago oh well and you know microwaves right unbelievable and everyone has uh multiple televisions probably and oh i've got yeah i mean i've i'm single and i have three televisions you know and i really they're two well um-hum one of them is primary and the other one i turn on maybe three times a month and i've got another one i bet i haven't turned on in six months i mean it's there you know uh-huh and i think about it too i have uh uh four telephones right we load up on all of the conveniences and they're not special to us anymore just a um that's right that's right necessity and there's the people who don't have televisions are are uh you know unusual in our society yeah uh yeah it almost like uh you know it's a big uh issue i've run across a few people before that that you know make a make a point uh that uh the fact that they uh don't own a television and of course you know people look at them yeah like yeah you know but um-hum um-hum and it's it's it would be really quite frankly even though i am not  who uh does your family keep a budget at all or well i sort of i mean in my mind i do i don't write anything down or anything like that yeah ah i just know what my bills are and how much i need for that and what's extra i'm a nurse and so i kind of figure i'm taking home a hundred dollars a day ah huh oh really so when i look at things like to buy or anything i think of it in days uh-huh if i hear something is three hundred dollars i think hm that's three extra days you know something like that so so everything in my mind is by days and that's that's about the extent of my budget yeah you three extra days you'd a yeah about it huh yeah we've uh we've been trying to save for a house we've been really trying to penny pinch and oh that's a good one i tell you it gets tough when you know we have i've tried to write something out on a computer and stuff but it seems like every week there's something that comes up and makes it about impossible to well that's what happens that's exactly what happens it car breaks down or somebody gets sick or um-hum um-hum so just when you think you might get a little ahead that's right that's what happens exactly so that's kind of hard but but are you uh are you able to plan or save anything for the healthy future or no i know it it's a day to day thing no no not at all not at all i i barely get by yeah i know all that's we i have my wife and a daughter and it's about impossible yeah it's hard it's real hard and uh it doesn't get much better either that's how it goes but i know but you know i just think that well that's good to hear you're marked and you're supposed to have x amount of dollars and that's the way it's gonna be you know i mean that's just that's how it feels really because it's it's just some people are just and there's nothing you can do about it huh yeah have more money and some don't and that's it so uh-huh and and i'm lucky i have a very low mortgage payment because i i had my house for a long time and yeah it makes you wonder how they get it all i mean oh do you huh i don't have a car payment and you know i i don't have a lot of things so i'm pretty lucky but i have to make come up with the money totally by myself so that's hard too you know just it yeah well that's what's amazed us is we've been trying to get into a house and i just i just with what we make a payment i mean it's about double what we pay for rent i just can't see how people do it these days yeah how is housing there so well it's actually Utah's been lucky we haven't been hit by the recession so housing prices have stayed up the only thing that's helping us is that the mortgage rates are going down but uh it's still moving pretty brisk and yeah i say we've been kind of lucky we haven't been hit with the same kind of stuff that the rest of the nation has yeah yeah we've been able to stay out of you know that we haven't lost many jobs or anything like that up around yeah well i'm lucky i'll never lose yeah that nursing but you know it doesn't matter if i lose a job one place i'll just go somewhere else so yeah i've often said if i had it to do all over again i think i'd go into something like that i seems like there's always you look in the paper and there's a huge demand for nursing and stuff so yeah oh oh yeah really and and they get a little picky in one place and i know where i am now there's a whole big new administration and they're they're scaring everybody to death but i don't work on staff i just work on call um-hum oh do you you just work on call huh and um-hum and so i have a couple of agencies that i work for and i make much more money that way and i can be independent i don't have to go to all the meetings and get into the politics and huh yeah i don't get the benefits but i think it's more than worth it then i just pay for that so yeah it's a great thing but it's risky and most people don't wanna oh yeah definitely definitely sounds yeah but it sounds like you've been doing all right with it so do that yeah i've i feel like it you know and it's much more interesting that way too you don't get burned out so much so um-hum yeah so do you have a family or yeah i have a twelve year old and so yeah i have to you know take care of her so yeah so we know we've got to cover certain things it's not just me so um-hum oh do you enough to keep you kind of busy yeah yeah that's true yeah i uh that's what uh you know we're trying to we well i mean we've got a long ways off before school starts my daughter's just eighteen months but oh you know you think about it i had to struggle my whole time through college you know pay for my own and get an occasional grant here and there but i just don't know how you know they can ever do it in ten years fifteen years from now when i have to go and well i know what you mean it does look impossible you look around you and i don't know how young people buy houses today or anything i really don't know and yeah and a small little you know two bedroom home with you know five hundred square feet is about sixty thousand it seems like and those are pretty hefty payments to oh that's terrible yeah well that's in Utah like i say i think we're we're probably below the market for the most part we're pretty lucky that way but oh yeah well it's not too bad in this area really the thing is there's a lot of money and like i'm in Plano so it's a little bit north of Dallas but hasn't it uh-huh but there's so much money in this town and there are things that are three hundred and five hundred thousand and lots and lots of them ooh but you can buy a nice three bedroom home for like eighty thousand oh that's not bad so it really isn't it's low compared to the rest of the country you know and there's all kinds of um-hum  wood working do you do much in the way of wood working not a terrific amount to be honest with you uh i really don't have much in the way of tools i'd like to get a router and uh some other things like that but i really don't have much how about yourself i'm in about the same condition um had access to a fair amount of my father's place before i uh-huh moved away but uh it's been several years ago uh-huh but i've always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working you know i've made a just some simple things here just some shelves and uh saw horses you know nothing real complicated did a little bit of framing when i was going to you know in high school framing like picture framing right yeah no uh uh home framing i guess that's not wood working that's construction i guess but in high school shop you know like every body had to build a couple of things and i really liked it i thought it was a lot of fun yeah oh okay yeah okay well it was yeah but you do need the tools i don't have much in the way of tools to be honest i don't have a table saw or a drill press or any of that kind of stuff yeah my right now what i've got in the way of wood working tools is a circular saw and a uh square yeah that's it well a drill i do have a drill no i've got a drill and i think i got a jig saw and i got a a circular saw but yeah i don't know the wood working projects i've been involved with lately we uh converted a uh a very large section of shelving from an a restaurant that went belly up into a small smaller set for the home it something for my text books and my computer to stand on oh uh-huh yeah um no well that's kind of similar to what i've done uh had a father-in-law that got a bunch of uh uh real nice heavy doors from a motel that went out of business ooh and uh they made a great table top so i made a nice work bench with a peg board back on it and um-hum it's smooth faced doors pardon me these are like smooth faced doors yeah they're solid core and uh they they made a real terrific uh table top for a for a work bench there yeah it would so you know it's real steady and that would make a good table top well it's you know i watch this guy on TV once in a while oh the fellow with the beard that's hooked up with Sears now is it the New Yankee oh no no it's this other guy it's called the New Yankee uh Workshop i don't know if you've ever seen him or not Villa or something like doohinkey new Yankee New Yankee New Yankee Workshop i think that's what it's called but he makes uh mostly furniture items you know he'll make a a mirror or a chest of drawers or a table oh okay it's a series though huh and uh it's fascinating to watch him work you know he does a terrific job but he's got every single thing you can imagine you know yeah oh yeah he's got a he's got the sort of thing that that uh you know a professional shop would envy envy more than likely yeah yeah he's he's got all the all those things you'd like and and uh that's the problem i watch him do those things and i say you know i probably could do that given a little bit of experience yeah if i had yes if i had five or ten thousand dollars in equipment like i'm sure he has yeah well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do but it just takes more time and and a lot more talent when you have you got limited resources yeah that that's true you have to be better than than he is and that's hard to do what gets makes you a little nervous when you you know you're on a real nice piece of hard wood you don't wanna mess up on it yeah oh yeah it's expensive stuff and yeah last piece of hard wood that i bought was uh let's see a a one by ten by so one one inch by ten inch by four foot piece of uh um-hum of walnut oh oh beautiful piece of walnut uh-huh and now now for the life of me i don't know what i did with that board i carried it around i i got it all sanded out and planed out and never did get done with what ever it was i'd originally planned to do with it and i think i wound up giving it to my little brother oh is that right yeah anyway well i've been tempted once in a while to uh i don't know you have these uh community education programs um-hum where you're adult education you can you can take a class in the evenings where you go at the local high school or the community college and sign up for a wood working class i've been tempted to do that yeah yeah i have some a friend that made a microwave stand and some you know some other kinds of things like that did a nice job and then you know then you can use their stuff i've well it's one night a week and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy uh-huh i don't know i was uh thirty three and i and just started college yeah and i mean going into it was like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun but and i had all kinds of little buts that never really amounted to much but you know when i finally got into it i was so glad i did uh-huh yeah well well that's the one hobby i'd like to develop more i'll be honest with you uh yeah yeah it it it's i mean hobbies like that are therapeutic too it'd be yeah  uh we have a Sheltie Collie a miniature Sheltie do you yeah it's about oh about six months old and we're trying we're we we live in an apartment so we don't have a yard so it has to stay stay stay inside and we're having a difficult time trying to train it how old is it it's about six months uh you you're you're in the roughest stages of pet ownership i think really but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs but i guess every one one every one one of them or or every once in a while you get one that's not so intelligent because this one isn't well i don't i don't know if that has anything to do with the intelligence really the the the training bit uh i've had dogs through the years right now i've got two and three cats but uh and uh my son and daughter-in-law have kind of a Sheltie mix and we watched it this summer for two to three months and it wasn't trained quite fully either um-hum and uh but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog yeah so how'd y'all how do you what's the best method i don't know i i'm old fashioned and when i got my my dogs when they when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside they say that's not the way to do it now but you're just supposed to right stand outside with them until they no just just you put them outside i guess unless you catch catch them in the act well we're hardly ever at home so it's kind of difficult and yeah you know you don't wanna you don't wanna spank it or scare it or anything like that so no you no you don't wanna do that but uh yeah we we try to take it you know it gets it gets frustrating when you take it outside and you know and then it runs right inside and it does it huh does does does it just wanna sniff around and does it just wanna sniff around and play when it's outside yeah a lot of times and you know it it won't it's whole job outside and it comes inside yeah have have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside uh yeah we've tried that and uh you know there's certain spots in the house where he likes to go so and he chews on plants and all that but you know that's natural for a little puppy huh yeah that's nothing huh well it it it'll it'll catch on pretty soon i'll i'll i'll betcha i i have a sixteen year old almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever and she's gone the other way because she's so old she doesn't have much control oh really so we're battling with that problem and she still feels good uh she can't hear worth a darn or see very well but she's got a great appetite and she knows we're there by smell oh that's sad huh how old is it she'll be sixteen in May man that's sad and yeah but we can't bear to do anything because she's been our friend for all these years so we're putting up with all her accidents oh of course not i couldn't and the last two nights ago she had diarrhea and so that was a bad one but uh i think we're buying a carpet shampooer this weekend that is really sad what what's the deal we we try to we're trying to take it on walks now you know um-hum and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash yeah and so it i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to you know tug on it to walk it i mean it just goes like a mad dog i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping and does it oh it's you know i mean it's not even close to even being trained on a leash uh-huh uh you know maybe you need you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes um-hum well we've heard bad we've heard some bad things about some of those you know they sometimes misuse misuse their license or whatever you know and they treat them bad oh well you know where we went we went to the junior college Richland oh really and we took my my daughter was living at home then and she took our Golden Retriever or not the Golden Retriever the Norwegian Elk Hound over there and oh really it it it's a pretty good class and they did pretty good except this dog is she's just pretty she's not smart so she didn't learn a lot but it i think it calmed her down a little bit and she's used to being around other dogs now uh-huh how long did it take i think it was like a six week program every what uh i think it was one night a week for like six weeks and uh you know it was a group class outside oh really it was fairly reasonable too well Sheltie Collies are you know timid and they don't really unless they get used to something they're really nervous and yeah they're pretty they're usually a high strung dog aren't they yeah yeah and uh if they're not accustomed to something they they're really scared so um our our friend has a  where in California you live uh it's near National it's near uh San Diego it's called National City okay i was down that way once but i don't think i remember that is it on the coast yeah it's just a little rinky-dink town but most people don't go there it's really not a good neighborhood i went all the way down to Imperial Beach once that's far as i went yeah it's nicer down there uh-huh unfortunately i need to be near near the naval base so my choice of living quarters is limited so um are you ready to begin yes i guess we're gonna talk about camping is that right right okay i'll push the button hang on okay all right there we go so do you go camping at all well yeah my wife and i like to camp um usually just on short trips like a weekend or long weekend and we generally go to uh State or National parks yeah my husband and i like going for the long weekends we usually like going up to one of the camping grounds that have a lake near it because we like to fish and camp uh-huh yeah well we don't really care for fishing anything that that resembles work uh so we just uh what we do is hike and take pictures that's about all yeah i i like hiking unfortunately around here there's not too many spots to do stuff like that well Texas has a pretty nice system of state parks we've got um state parks just all over the place on different kinds of terrain and most of them yeah i'm from Arizona and they've got a lot of it there too they've also got desert desert uh i don't know what you call it but uh sites in the desert they have a special name for it well Texas has every thing from desert to uh swamp so i don't think they have too many i don't think i'd like the swamp but mountains and deserts they don't have too many swamps in Arizona i don't think i don't think i've uh seen too many swamps in Arizona huh no it's pretty much dry now we may do some camping camping in Arizona though i've got uh my uh brother and sister and father all live in Sedonia now Sedonia yeah oh really do you know where Mayer's at what is it Mayer outside Prescott Mayer oh yeah uh yeah i i think i remember going through there is that between Prescott and Jerome or over the other way over the other way it's actually if you blinked you'd miss it uh-huh well it be yeah i think i do remember a little wide place in the road called Mayer well anyway they uh everybody there says that you know there are places you can camp uh right around Sedonia there are oh there's a lot of beautiful camping places around Sedonia and they're getting they're getting more of them yeah uh-huh they're just doing it slowly but surely but um i like the rustic kind of camping yeah well we we do we like actually we like to get off uh where there aren't too many people around yeah we did find a nice uh prospect uh down on the gulf um there's a uh national wildlife wildlife refuge called Urandus i don't know if you've heard of it that's where the whooping cranes go in the winter or at least where a lot of them go uh-huh and uh there's and island right off that called Matagorda and uh you can take a ferry boat out there and it's uh completely uh pretty much anyway complete wilderness island oh that'd be neat sort of like a big sand bar you know you wanna make sure there aren't any big storms coming really but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh right it's really nice out there lots of sea birds that sounds like it'd be nice yeah unfortunately my husband and i haven't been able to go camping because i just had two kids two two boys and all at once or all at once huh well no no i spaced them about a year a part uh-huh but until they get a little bit older we really don't want to take them out camping with us that could be difficult i've seen a few people had small babies camping but uh didn't look like any of them were really enjoying the experience very much yeah when i go camping i like to get out and hike and do things and when you have little kids you really can't do that very much yeah well i sort of like to feel less tied down rather than more tied down when i go camping and right that's the object of it you know get out and feel free and do things you don't normally get to do uh-huh but um yeah we haven't got to go lately but when we go we we're from Arizona so when we go back on vacation next year we'll get to go which should be nice well i really like Arizona i like uh uh a couple times this last year i've made it up to Jerome just to enjoy the altitude and everything and it's really neat up there somehow it is actually i met the town historian  yeah huh all right um exercise huh yeah um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh i've got a routine for every morning of the week and i don't work out on Saturday or Sunday uh-huh uh-huh but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training they set that up for you no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and i've been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives uh-huh but i pretty much uh worked on my own routine and uh what kind of running do you do they've got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles uh-huh um-hum and then after that i work out with weights is it just aerobic or uh and i work out with free weights no i mean the running oh uh yeah it's really uh aerobic work out part you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less uh about seven minutes uh-huh and then you wouldn't then you don't get um out of breath uh no i do yeah that's that's a pretty good pretty good clip and i'll be i'm pretty winded by the time i get done oh oh so but i mean he's just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that oh yeah i i could i could probably go faster but then i'd wear myself out and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else yeah right yeah uh-huh yeah how about you yeah i i don't run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um um-hum weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and that's about it um-hum yeah yeah and i don't i don't lift any heavy weights uh they're about a third of my body weight oh i see so just uh just try and keep them uh i guess uh firm and yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh yeah yeah that's true um-hum and then i i hurt my neck uh about three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from hm yeah um hurting yourself when you play high oh i see i see you have to you have to do it correctly it's you know it's like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it um-hum oh i see uh so you're in uh in part of a band um i play at church oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasn't the trumpet so i was just wondering if that's what it was or something and um-hum yeah i see well yeah so you you have any plans of maybe running running more when the weather gets nicer well yeah well the weather's nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesn't that doesn't get it done i i i mostly jump rope more you know yeah yeah um-hum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves uh-huh um-hum and uh but it's been a while since i've done that yeah i i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesn't um i see it doesn't um accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you're running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time right right um-hum yeah i i that's true i've noticed that uh and it also builds too much mass if you just you know um-hum so and it's like i i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with uh-huh and um then it doesn't bother me very much yeah yeah huh that's that's interesting though i you know i've been thinking of changing i've done the same routine for almost two years now and i'm thinking it of changing it up um-hum uh that's why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine right because i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing um-hum so i'm looking at changing things a little bit yeah that's i i started doing more push ups and it it's helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i don't like you said wear it out i don't try to push it to the end in one set um-hum yeah  uh okay uh do you live in a a single family dwelling as they call it yeah i uh i'm buying my own home okay what sort of house is it um well it's a one story three bedroom two bath two car garage with a single living area a large single living area yeah yeah yeah garage is that an actual closed in garage or is that carport type of thing no it's a a closed in garage to attached to the house okay so that i can uh i can leave my home go into the garage get in the car and not get into any weather at all never actually be out of the house yeah around here they tell you if it if the advertisement for houses for sale says garage uh-huh it it it could mean anything from a uh part of the house all closed in to a uh uh nice corrugated fiberglass roof kind of hanging in the middle of the yard somewhere oh you're kidding that's crazy yeah most of them are carports you know they'll be attached to the to the to the house but it'll just be a an extension of roof to over you know one or two parking spaces where to the home uh-huh wow uh-huh most of the time when i had when i was looking for a house matter of fact the they would tell you if it were a carport or if it were um if it were a detached garage yeah yeah so now y'all aren't quite getting all that flooding that Texas has been getting have you ah yeah we're getting part of it uh-huh it's um you're getting part of that uh uh okay it's really kind of odd we ah we had hoped not to be in too much of it and matter of fight matter of fact in in Texas they have flood plain areas where it's every about every hundred years the area floods where the insurance companies won't insure you for it um-hum yeah what like uh like what is i'm trying to think of the name of that park there's areas that are so bad about flooding that they just don't cover them they yeah they wouldn't cut they will not issue flood insurance huh and i can i can see where there's some areas in Dallas that are definitely like that yeah but uh you know come to think of it it's that way around here too i mean you know there there's nothing even vaguely resembling hills around here oh no huh we have which was real confusing when i first moved into this area because it was it what kind of uh home are you in well actually right now my wife and i are living uh campus housing oh okay is it uh apartment style or uh-huh yeah they're apartment buildings one and two and three bedroom places uh be like you know uh-huh excuse me like uh twenty five or thirty units per building and then something like uh oh okay twenty five thirty buildings gosh about half of them are one bedroom places uh-huh there's a pretty good number of two bedroom places and then there's like uh fifteen or twenty three bedroom places three bedroom uh-huh but uh oh they're not really too bad they're they're basically cinder block places well i was that's kind of what i had envisioned from uh visiting the ones in at North Texas University where my husband just graduated but uh yeah graduated in in what uh physics physics PhD in physics wow sounds like fun oh yeah yeah i i've got a physics couple of physics classes facing me this summer this summer so uh actually they're they're very enlightening and they're a lot of fun yeah uh from what i've seen of it i mean you know there's a lot of things that kind of dabble in the edges of physics before you actually get into the class they are yeah well most everything touches physics one way or another no matter what you do even if nobody tells you that's what it is it's it's physics yeah yeah i remember a a teacher in high school saying that uh he enjoyed physics because it it improved his uh his uh pool game uh-huh oh yeah mathematics too but uh anyway yeah uh back to housing what kind of a home would you and your wife look for yeah once uh once you finish schooling um well once we get out of school we're hoping to get into the mountains somewhere oh really probably out west um uh-huh Oregon Oregon or Washington yeah more than likely uh the rainy side of the mountains somewhere uh-huh oh that's a beautiful area but uh um originally i'm from West Virginia in the Appalachian Mountains uh-huh so uh uh long since fell in love with living in the mountains but it'd probably be like a two story possibly even a three story if we build our own we might even get a little crazy and you know build into the side of a hill oh i see and do it the that would probably  any vacations recently that you would highly recommend well that is like my favorite hobby so yeah i travel everywhere and i've been all over Europe and oh really a lot of the United States and Hawaii and oh wow wow so when i can that's what i do uh-huh uh what what has been your favorite trip do you think well i'm not sure um i guess Hawaii is one of my favorite places really better than Europe yeah well no that's exciting you know i've been several times so after the first time it's like anywhere you know it loses that newness but oh yeah i love it i love to go over to Europe i do and mostly i've traveled through Germany and Switzerland and um-hum we have good friends in England so i've been there quite a bit and i just love it all i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and to see how different things are from the way we do them um-hum sure um-hum the most interesting part more than the museums and things like that um-hum so how about you yeah well uh i have never been i've been to Canada several times but uh that is about it for me i'm i'm from a Denver and so uh growing up uh we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado uh-huh uh my family is uh uh real into camping and four wheeling and so um several i i think maybe uh four summers in a row uh we spent uh our vacation time in the summer uh four wheeling through uh portions of uh the southern half of of Colorado uh and and uh every time uh my mother had uh uh i have two other sisters and my mother had us uh do some studying of the the area which we were going to visit and then we had to write uh oh no uh reports reports about it during during our vacation which which was really fun it was really fun we we we each got to write little books uh um-hum and uh it it had sparked an interest that uh uh of of mine that uh my fiancee is a is a um very very good photographer that's what she had originally gone to school to do was photography and uh um-hum i i'm close to receiving my English degree uh as as well as my my graduate degree so so i uh uh we've thought very seriously of trying to to uh incorporate travel into writing and and writing a book about uh uh some portion of travel uh so we're hoping soon uh not soon maybe within the next ten years to get to take a trip over from uh over over to Europe and take a trip from the northern portion of France um-hum uh down to the southern tip of Spain uh and follow uh it there's kind of a backward S shape uh trail that the pilgrims use to take uh in in uh back in the medieval times uh to see the relics uh in in Southern Spain and in Italy uh-huh and so we would like to take pictures of the Gothic uh and Romanesque uh monasteries and uh just take that journey all the way down and then right a book about it boy that would be quite a project yeah it would be it's it's our big dream yeah well it would be a lot fun you know there's there's good and there's bad and my experience in Italy wasn't my favorite for sure but oh sure really well i flew into Milan my daughter is uh a twirling champion um-hum um-hum and she had to perform over there and in Turin and so we had to fly into Milan and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the Italians even if they speak English they don't wanna let you know oh sure and they gave us all the wrong directions and there were just two of us at the airport they put us on the wrong bus but finally we saw a policeman he put us on the subway we sat there um oh uh-huh we didn't know Italian we looked at each other we said things like spaghetti you know things like that and we finally followed some kids he told us where to get off we followed these kids with uh gym bags and we figured that must be the sports arena uh-huh and we lucked out and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground i mean it was just it was kind of a nightmare but that was our experience and i guess all of Italy isn't like that wow uh-huh right but where we were it certainly was and the hotel that we stayed in we stayed with our English friends their team in the hotel and it was beautiful it was very modern um-hum but it was very far away on a bus so you know it was it was really uh it was interesting you always learn something oh yeah yeah and you will always have a fun experience so it it's great you know yeah you said you've been to England several times uh-huh i wonder have you ever been to a uh a small town uh well it's it's actually about uh thirty minutes from Salisbury it's called uh Bemerton no i haven't huh-uh our friends live like an hour outside of England like Ash around there so um-hum okay oh okay all right yeah i i i the reason i'm curious um i uh that's the other place i would like to visit uh most  well Wendy what kind of music do you like um i i'm pretty flexible i i could like i like just about everything minus um hard rock um-hum and i don't really like um rap um-hum but i like classical jazz um you know um contemporary i don't know what you call it i guess light rock or easy listening or whatever what about you um-hum um a lot the same i don't like hard rock at all and i uh don't like um rap either i don't care too much for jazz sometimes i do a few things i have heard that i like but hang on excuse me Rusty no my dog's getting in the trash okay go ahead okay and um i like classical and i like um a lot of different kinds of contemporary um folksy type where you can hear the words and um you know where there are something they're saying um-hum um-hum um i guess my preference is um well either classical or Christian contemporary or uh praise type songs and who who in the Christian contemporary do you like to listen to um i don't have a particular favorite i um i like some of the music that's put out by Hosannah um Integrity tapes they're instrumental mostly um where they just have um uh-huh praise songs and it's set to just instruments or um praise songs with words um uh-huh there's a few things i don't pay too much attention i turn the radio on and i don't always pay attention to who is singing what i just know there's a song here a song there i like i don't spend a lot of money buying tapes and stuff so i don't either unless i know that i like uh you know a lot of the music on a particular cassette yeah yeah but i do uh my husband's from Latin America and uh so i listen to Salsa which is typical of where he's from and uh-huh and it it's a really lively fun music you'll you'll find yourself just moving just listening to it yeah yeah it's it's fun but mostly i'll listen to uh i guess i listen to easy listening in the car but if i am at home i'll listen to i don't know if if not jazz you know it'll be some type of uh like i was talking about you know the music from his area or um i like gospel music i listen to a lot of i like a cappella gospel um-hum um-hum yeah i do too there's a group called Take Six that that does some really lovely stuff i mean some of it is a little too um it's too i mean it it's it's too much along the lines of of a lot of black music it's too uh it's not rap but it's just not enough gospel for me but their first um works that came out i really enjoyed them um um-hum um-hum have your ever heard of John Michael Talbot yeah i have heard of him the name rings familiar i don't know why though yeah yeah i guess i he's one that at least i know you know if i hear his name i'll probably like it cause i he just has a real um-hum quiet reflective i think he just accompanies himself on the guitar and uh classical guitar and i really like classical guitar yeah hm well that sounds nice yeah i like classical guitar too um Strings and Fur i don't know if you heard of them they are not exactly classical but they have got some really lovely music out that is along those lines hm uh-huh and who else God i've got we've got a couple really good um tapes i cannot remember who else there's another group called Gypsy Kings that i listen to that it's it's in Spanish but even if you don't understand it it sings a lot of stuff that that anybody's familiar with like you remember the song Volare well anyways yeah i think so uh-huh uh-huh i remember the song and um you know it's a lot of guitar type of uh from Spain type stuff it's really beautiful yeah have you ever heard of um a Venezuelan he's local but he's cut a couple of albums now or whatever you call them these days CDs i guess yeah um Carlos Guetison de Speil have you yeah yes i have i have i don't have any of his work but i do like like it i have heard it on the Oasis yeah yeah yeah he's on the Oasis and um i have heard him play locally so have you yeah he plays sometimes at La Madeline and um there's a couple other places that he is regular at and um yeah i really enjoy him uh-huh yeah i don't know do do would you consider that Latin type music or um yeah there's there's a little bit of that bit of that in there yeah uh-huh i'm sure the influence is there somehow yeah exactly well i think we have covered it yeah okay what do you think i think so so it was good talking to you it was nice talking to you too have a good evening bye-bye you too good bye  okay uh do you cook quite a bit uh not really actually uh i live by myself and so most of my cooking is pretty basic you know just for myself but i cook when i go home my mom doesn't like to cook so i cook all my parents' meals when i go home and that's about the only opportunity i like to but i just you know that's good practice though hard to get motivated to cook for yourself i know when i was single it was uh i wouldn't cook much of anything i think one night i sauteed a pound of mushrooms and that was dinner yeah but uh well right now my husband and i live in uh uh subdivision that we have a dinner club thingy oh and what we do is once a month we'll meet at one house and the host will prepare the entree and provide the drinks and then every one else brings something oh and then it rotates from month to month you get together with four couples so you only host one time that's pretty nice it is really nice but uh well what kind of things do you usually have i mean do you do you usually have like you know ethnic food do you try a different thing every time or well we haven't but i think that'd be great you know do Mexican one time or Chinese the next time thinking the next one we get into that i'll do that but basically the host so far have just been picking you know what we have and then they'll let the people know and they'll uh uh ask people to bring something to compliment it but personally i like to prepare something that i could have done ahead of time oh sure because i can't talk and cook at the same time uh if i tried you know i i leave ingredients out but uh oh yeah we're suppose to be hosting next time i'm thinking of about having beef stroganoff because i can do that ahead of time oh yeah my mom does that and freezes it a lot of times and really yeah now now is this one of the dishes that you cook huh-uh one of my mom's bailiwick it's really simple so don't don't let it uh i was going to say i kind of i do not know i do odd things i guess what do you cook when you go home um i guess last time i was home was at Christmas and i cooked um i bought some really good beef tenderloin at um Ralph's in Snider Plaza um-hum and um i had i my parents have a deep freeze so i bought like oh God i want to say it was like four pounds and put it in the deep freeze and so i cooked one of them you know and basically have you ever used that DV sauce no what is it it's like um a meat a beef enhancer or something like that um-hum i mean it might not i i haven't really looked at the ingredients and it may be one of those things where if if it may have MSG in it i really haven't really looked i do not think it does but it might but that doesn't bother me anyway so uh you know i kind of like sprinkle some of that on it and then take like you know pieces of cloves of garlic and sort of push them down into the meat oh you sound like my husband he's a garlic freak too and then yeah and then bake it you know and it it always turns out really good i mean course you know the better the the the quality of the meat the better it turns out but um-hum you know and if you can leave it out on the counter for a little bit and you know to soak in the the garlic and everything you know that works pretty well but you know that's kind of that's kind of basic and i can do some Chinese and junk like that but um-hum do you uh stir fry some sometimes um i had one but i loaned it to somebody and they never gave it back do you have a wok well i'd call them up so i kind of just use a skillet really probably works just as well oh yeah that's something you know we don't do all that often and every time we do it i think why don't we cook this way more often because it is healthy you get a lot of vegetables and everything sure and the easy see now that would be an easy thing to do for the dinner party because you could do that in advance you know you i would just get like um you could use do chicken or beef either one and you know kind of chop it up into about inch cubes you know and the marinade i think that is like um um-hum oh like a cup of water and maybe three tablespoons of soy sauce soy and one tablespoon of Lea and Perrins or Worcestershire Worcestershire sauce or whatever sauce i can't pronounce it um-hum uh-huh i always call it Lea and Perrins because i can't say the name of it and uh garlic and chopped green onions and then you know chop up all of your meat like the night before and stick it in a tupperware dish with the um-hum you know with the stuff and let it marinade over night and then just strain out you know the juice and um you know then then you know stir fry the meat and um you can get the cans of sliced water chestnuts and bamboo shoots and um-hum you can put mushroom  yeah they they asked us um you know whether we felt the uh the war was was justified in dollars and lives and i mean i i really can't uh see how it was i think the more interesting part of the question to me was the effect that it had on uh on the US yeah i think that's what's called a moot question you yeah real good point but i was thinking you know i was while i was waiting for a connection i was just thinking about it i said you know the i don't know if without the Vietnam War if we would have had you know all the hippie era the protestors demonstrations um you know and the the effect that it had on Rock and Roll and you know all of the uh the baby boomers i mean i i think it you know has a profound effect on all of us yeah the the i think that had we had the war or had we not had the war we'd a had a lot similar uh effect upon the population in terms of the the freedom era as it were right i think what we saw was a phenomenon of a large number of young people at one time that were of the age of decision without the maturity to handle it right me among them yeah yeah likewise likewise and uh you know Richard Nixon is my hero because he kept me out of that place and my number was six i was going yeah and wow oh well see my my uh the the i had uh i had forgot i hadn't even thought about that in a long long time i had two numbers the lowest one i had was like a a sixty eight i think and then another one uh i had like a one thirty seven i think you know yeah yeah forget that you're not going yeah but uh you know none the less uh i was busy going to college when that was happening you know well i quit college when uh they when they moved out yeah went into construction yeah took me seventeen years to finish my degree yeah well um i don't know it's uh is it was it worth while from who's point of view well i think that i think what it showed though was that uh you you know America was was is is not invincible and all powerful and uh you you know it it also shows that even with the the kind of money that was thrown into it and the the uh uh armaments uh with the way it was waged which was not an all out war and i guess that's the other thing too it was never a declared war so you you know it never did really have the backing of the people well i think one of the the major points that a lot of people including myself missed until recently is the fact that we could have annihilated the north had we wanted to oh and i agree with that but it was uh it was such a uh a a limited uh you know one hand tied behind your back uh well even even at even at the not on the you know the gross tactical but on the on the very minute tactical arena yeah you know they were sending out you know eight or nine guys to engage a company right you know and they'd get wiped out you wonder why you know and yeah at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and uh components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians why why was that why because somebody was getting rich i found that everywhere you look if you find the money you'll find out why yeah yeah good point and Dow Chemical had a real good thing going you know Dow Chemical had a photographer at every demonstration oh really yes and if your picture was in that demonstration you didn't get hired by Dow Chemical really how interesting yeah and uh DuPont was was uh doing a lot of that too yeah DuPont is um they're they're not high on my list of favorites they uh they fought uh the banning of ozone uh or rather um not ozone but uh freon just tooth and nail yeah well it's a big part of their market oh right right but i mean you know they they took uh you know all the data that had been uh produced uh from back uh in the late uh eighties middle mid to late eighties about uh you know in the uh how freon was uh shown to to damage the ozone and uh they just you know were adamant that uh you know and and they have no moral conscience yeah really and that goes into and it and it's all tied together too i kind of believe that the Vietnam event i'm not gonna call it a war or a police action it was an event that the main push for that was outside the United States our involvement for one thing we were on the wrong side you know we were on the side of the fascist dictator and you know Ho Chi Minh if you've read any of his writings he was a democrat hum you know he wanted democracy really but he was forced to sleep with  um well i'm glad i got a male because i'm gonna need some help um i haven't really given any dinner parties but um i've had you know friends over for lunch that kind of thing but i promised my husband that i would throw him a Super Bowl party and so he's real excited about it but i don't know what men like to eat because it's different from women so um maybe you could help me out here in this sense and i keep i keep asking him you know what what what do you think we ought to have you know but i was thinking of like you one of those subway sandwiches those long subway sandwiches and maybe uh well i um a pasta salad and some chips and some beer and some Coke and um i thought a cake and he said no and so we're just going back and forth so you you could probably probably get uh the sub might work uh-huh uh the beer will definitely work a lot of that yeah yeah and uh chips and dips will probably work yeah yeah he's i don't really think men care do they uh not really to be honest with you i mean i i've never i've never really cared i just like little munchies and stuff basically you know just dip chips and dip usually do it if there's enough of it yeah that's what he said right but males usually aren't into meals you know like more than and not as much as women you know like just sitting around and eat the finger sandwiches and stuff yeah yeah and but uh i've always i've always you know just had chips dip and beer and just gone for it from there yeah yeah yeah so that oh okay i'll guess i'll do something like that but um i got a i got a good dip oh really yeah i i stole it from a restaurant okay what is that it is uh you get a can of can of uh chopped spinach uh-huh and you get uh fresh Parmesan Cheese uh-huh and you get uh uh artichoke hearts uh-huh okay you get uh a whole can of artichoke hearts you take about out of the i tell you out of the it's about a four ounce can of spinach out of that you take about an ounce and a half to two ounces of spinach uh-huh okay you stick all of it in a food processor okay you need to get uh and you grind mix it up real good it's almost pureed yeah to a degree and you heat that up and you take uh i'd say approximately eight ounces of the fresh Parmesan Cheese and you uh put it in there while it's heating up uh-huh and you mix it up and this is a recipe from Houston's restaurant oh really is this an artichoke dip because a friend of mine had that at at one of her parties and it was really good but when she told me it was artichoke dip i was going oh no that i stole yeah yeah yeah this is artichokes spinach and parmesan cheese and that's all that's in there as i'm not much of a fan for artichoke oh i'm sorry and heavy it has heavy cream in it too that one see i thought that was something else i forgot forgot about that huh it has heavy cream in there i i i just i fling it every time i do it i huh mean i don't have anything written down i just kind of know it from i just go by taste and texture yeah yeah i've never really written it down but they never give me any specs on it i've just kind of had a variance of it you know every time i go in and it gets pretty close you've just got to watch how much spinach you put in there you've got to put it a little bit at a time it should be a uh uh uh like about a guacamole lighter than a guacamole color yeah that's a party it sounds like the same thing my friend served and it was really good but when she told me it had artichokes in i thought oh God yeah and it's served yeah and it's served hot it's served hot yeah uh-huh it was it yeah and it's real good i don't know if they'd go for that or not but it's just a real good dip well my husband loved it yeah he really did yeah it's a fancy i think in Houston's it's called a Chicago dip oh really huh yeah if you ever go there try it that's the stuff yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so chili is usually guys usually go for chili now that you now that you mention it oh yeah yeah probably go for chili and beer that's always a good gas burner and no women and children allowed and i that's right plenty plenty of ceiling fans going yeah i guess so well um let me see we went to a Christmas party and uh a friend of mine had this and it was she had the she was the one that had that dip and another thing that my husband really liked that i and i liked too that i would have never thought of serving and it was really easy um and it sounds it doesn't sound good but when you all put when you put it together and you taste it it's real excellent it's um the Mexicorn and uh-huh and corn chips you mix all that together with a bottle of the Catalina dressing and you and you just mix it all together and you serve it like that and it is really good right huh  we could talk about my favorite subject cooking and foods huh what do you like to cook food uh i don't cook a lot actually i've just started baking so i'm kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that but i can't seem to get them exactly right so just trying to perfect some things i don't know i tried to make an apple sauce cake which i will never ever try to make again um-hum it was horrible i don't know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible oh dear oh probably not i have uh a bread recipe that's real easy that everyone always really does like that uh doesn't require kneading the dough hum oh hey and it's oh it is it's wonderful it's and what's funny is that you use uh bran All Bran and it looks like it's a wheat bread but it's actually All Bran and flour and uh um-hum hum um-hum you know it's regular types that you know you use and that sort of thing and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls and they really are good and they're so easy to do um-hum wow um-hum that it seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that uh we're going some place where everybody's supposed to bring something and they've had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls um-hum they request it i haven't gotten any requests yet actually we i had a Christmas party at uh my office and i made the tuna fish sandwiches and everyone i mean i'm i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so that'd be easy for me to make and i can't go wrong with it and so i made it and i used celery seed in my do you use celery seed in your tuna fish no i haven't uh and i i just thought it was so strange because i've never i thought that that's what celery seed was for was for tuna fish oh how funny and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it and it just surprised me celery and and onion and uh-huh well see i i've always used celery i mean i've used celery before but i've never used the celery seed in it um-hum oh yeah it's great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed and i used like uh Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because i really don't like mayonnaise the Helman's mayonnaise um-hum but if you use a salad dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good but i was uh it was the first time i've um-hum i've ever found out that that nobody else used celery seed i feel so silly but well see i've never put bell pepper in tuna fish either yeah i isn't that funny yeah that's weird i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which it now is a no no with cholesterol um-hum right uh-huh oh and uh you know chopped up uh dill pickles and that sort of thing the standard old tuna fish right yeah yeah i would i would put that too i just didn't have those things like i don't think i had eggs that night or something but i would have put eggs i would have put in eggs in there also um-hum but isn't that interesting so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed i'll have to try that but that's strange and celery seed do you use a regular mayonnaise or sometimes i do sometimes i use Miracle Whip it depends on what i have and sometimes if i'm using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit i'll use a little bit of mustard with it the salad the Miracle Whip yeah um-hum yeah i do that also um-hum just to put a little zing in it or something um-hum yeah but not a bunch but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor oh no what what else do i like i love barbecue anything barbecue i'll eat um-hum i like uh barbecue baby back ribs um um and uh and and they're so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you just cook them very very slowly in the oven and it's not hard to cook like some meals are um-hum um-hum yeah hum and it's not of course it's messy to eat that's the disadvantage and uh i make lasagna from scratch and people really like my lasagna and yeah yeah i like to make that too i make that once in a while and so um sometimes i'm requested to make that hum or and that's and that's not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it it's not really as long as you have all the ingredients it's just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh pasta is the hardest part probably um-hum yeah um-hum then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie it just takes forever but it's uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy but um yeah um do you make a cheese cake um um-hum i do but this one is basically it's like a normal pie crust but then you use this sort of uh it's a cream cheese um hum um-hum uh layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that um um-hum and so it's sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake and you know but but it's not a real cheese cake and then you um yeah and you just put the strawberries  uh what do you how do you feel about it well i don't know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like it's part of living in a free country but it seems like they take quite a bit out uh i'm a tax lawyer and uh i uh oh yeah but i agree with you i uh yeah you probably know like i say you're a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly i um-hum yeah corporations i work for a bank yeah oh do you oh yeah and uh and so what what do they think the corporation you work with um well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so yeah uh-huh we don't have the franchise taxes which are are not federal taxes uh yeah i don't know i i think they i don't hear anything at work about them really yeah well i tell you i i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do oh okay what's the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i don't want to say battles but do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair unfair uh unfair playing field and whatnot and whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get we've had that too because of the failures though oh yeah and uh whether or not they should be assessed more uh-huh and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area it's where they're going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund or or higher assessment to yeah right huh yeah it's uh i don't know i want i think i've always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldn't be but it seems like more and more uh we're getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not uh i don't know that it is fair i think that it's you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran yeah yeah oh yeah and uh you know i think i think a little competition is good yeah uh but but down here a lot we saw we say them doing things they shouldn't be doing yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not we're yeah real estate you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff yeah and i don't know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed there's no doubt about it everybody's gone down i think the individual levels are fine uh-huh uh i don't think they're perceived as uh was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know uh-huh uh we wouldn't reduce the deficit by yeah but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that yeah well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean we've talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or well that's what sales tax are yeah that's true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh they're debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy uh-huh yeah and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesn't stimulate the economy that much it just uh boots everybody's feeling about stimulating the economy yeah that's more or less touchy-feely thing as opposed to yeah yeah i just always heard that the poor would end end up taking the worst brunt of it because they're you know their their income is less and yet they're being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know i've heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that it'll be maybe a different level of tax but seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldn't do much anyway the i i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct um-hum yeah that's true you can't take away people that said there you go you've got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didn't have this exception then we'll just add this one and it just gets it snowballs yeah that's true yeah uh-huh i i think it is in theory probably a good idea well uh are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or we don't have state income tax oh don't you oh that's sweet none but we've got an eight percent state sales tax oh that hurts yeah and uh you know course that's that's a regressive tax yeah it is and it's you know uh uh it's not on grocery  Kathy you you know i'm i was thinking about basketball teams and um the funny thing is when i was in college at BYU i followed the school team and um hi uh-huh and then when i graduated and we got married and everything i really kind of lost interest in following teams have you been following any not too much um who is it from the Mavericks that just wasn't there some controversy about one of their players that didn't get to play so now he doesn't he didn't get to play the whole game so now he doesn't want to play at all or something oh no i know they're always having um i mean i can't believe the amount of money that the players make in the first place and i mean i know that they have a short um career and everything its crazy right but even so i mean i don't think i will make a million in or three million in a life time let alone a season that's true it's really a lot but uh my sister always gets um season tickets to the Utah Jazz and um yep uh-huh so she watches their games a lot and and everything but i don't believe we've ever been involved with any team that you know makes it to the play-offs yeah yeah we came from Oakland i went to BYU also too much uh-huh you did yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the Mavericks here well i was at uh BYU when they made it to the play-offs and i think they played Notre Dame or something yeah um for the big game i can't remember now that was so seems like it was eons ago it was like ten years ago i think and um i remember uh-huh yeah yeah did you know let me think who was on that team there was a Dave Callus or a Gordon Breun remember those names um isn't that the one that was like the star player was Danny Ainge i think he started playing for the Boston Boston Celtics after that yeah Celtics right right and um and um and there was another the center it's been so long i can't think of anyone's name but um i i was there that year and enjoyed that game and uh but mostly like i say i haven't been following the teams and don't know who's got what record yeah right so do you play for your ward team i haven't played uh since i broke my knee cap but um i did play in high school i was on our high school girls' team oh oh uh-huh where did you go to high school well i lived in Missouri and i went and i played for Parkview High School in Missouri in Springfield Missouri and i played um a forward oh uh-huh and um i enjoyed that then and that's i always loved sports do you play for your ward yeah um i kind of stopped playing for my ward because i didn't like the sportsmanship with the stake the problem that is a problem so i play for a Richardson City league now uh-huh but as far as knowing anything about professional teams you know when they said to put put down what you're interested in i i wasn't really thinking about talking about no well i was thinking about my own personal basketball experiences as opposed to professional because i'd rather play than watch any thing right right right and um so i'm you know like i do you have any players that you like watching well i um i have one i don't like his name his last name was Sampson do you remember him and he because he came to Houston when i lived there and um to play for the Houston team and he was really yeah i thought a bad sport and uh and i haven't followed like i say yeah it really only takes one player to really give any team a bad rap you know one that um-hum um-hum yeah that's really true but um publicity bound you know that well and i also don't want to spend so much of my time um memorizing statistics right and um keeping you know being wrapped up in a team and caring whether they win or lose in the sense that it makes a big difference in my life you know because i just don't have that kind of time yeah that's right you know once it gets into the finals then i i kind of root for one or the other but up until then you know um-hum that's true and and you know i get i have interest in the games but i'm satisfied to watch a score in the newspaper or on you know the sports news report or something yeah the highlights right rather than just like you say watch clips from the game do you have kids that play no i my both my children are little they're just in kindergarten and first grade yeah yeah so no they don't play and um and my husband loves baseball which i don't really prefer but oh yeah so we haven't uh haven't don't been into basketball too much but anyway oh did you stay with now what team is it from Houston now i can remember even what they were called um i wanna say Spurs but is that right no i don't think so no it was the Astros the Astros were the baseball team and the Oilers Rockets yes that's it the Rockets yeah Rockets yeah yeah i uh you know we saw a game  okay what do you think something wrong with our school systems yes right um-hum nobody wants to go to public schools um yeah the class sizes are too large and they don't pay the teachers enough like in Dallas they have too many administrators they're top-heavy yeah and uh they had yesterday on the news they had some problems with the the text having um mistakes in them yeah and uh a lot of them aren't like the history books aren't historically correct they they covered up a lot of the bad things that have happened just what do you think can be done about that well i think they need to do whatever they can like um i think um Massachusetts put a priority on education and and um bringing in industry and recruiting yeah and they made a lot of difference in that state and in Texas i think we're like twenty ninth in spending you know and they put through this Robin Hood bill but it doesn't change the amount of spending overall it just distributes the money more evenly yeah and so that they need to do that they need to increase spending they need to um make it so that the teachers want to stay in teaching because most of the time the teachers spend disciplining the the kids instead of instead of teaching the subject now i agree so i've got a friend who's uh a very talented teacher and has given it up um-hum uh in Carrollton uh just because it's not i mean she just can't stand the paper work um you know it's uh and she's not paid enough she gets more as a filing claims for an insurance company which she's not even trained to do um-hum so i think it's real discouraging yeah and uh i i think they changed the way the ladder is now that it takes a longer time for for you to qualify for a higher salary and uh it's it's um it's more subjective than it was before yeah so i don't know you know i don't know what incentive a teacher has to stay in teaching i don't either well do you have children i just have uh one daughter she's six now she's going to Richardson Public Schools out of the Dallas School District basically um-hum yeah right i don't have any but if i did i don't know that i could i would want them to be in a Dallas School District right but the worst school districts are Dallas Garland Carrollton um Coppell really doesn't matter much it's it's is not at the bottom and the best is uh Highland Park Richardson and Plano yeah how old is your daughter she's six so she's just started this year yeah and you know and she's learning to read so and she can do a little bit of math now so where are you speaking from i can hear a lot of background noise oh uh Valley View Mall oh oh yeah there's supposed to all all the calls are supposed to be from a different phone so yeah that's where i am and they have a lot of pay phones here so wow that is funny you know and i and i don't know uh uh they cut back on the since Mark White passed that bill about well um-hum cutting back on all the extracurricular activities that may have improved a little bit because um i was talking to a lady the other day and that that's the first thing she said her her both her children were in band and they'd quit um-hum and she said the band teacher acted like band was the only subject that he was taking and he was suppose to spend spend all of his time on band and demanded the children right right and he he was taking honors classes in all his other subjects he goes to the Lewisville School District uh-huh and uh you know it's just ridiculous so he just quit simple as that hm everything should be equal you know and there's no reason you already spend all that time in band there's no reason that he should practice more than an hour a day outside of band if he if he even has the energy especially in marching season well that goes along with football though too you know it uh you know right and and what do you do when you are taking calculus and uh chemistry and physics two and  okay yeah Donna um you said you have three children what uh kinds of activities do you spend with them is it you know okay um we have an eleven year old an eight year old and a three year old and um uh-huh uh my husband let's see he coaches basketball with Brian um so he spends time doing that with him planning and um practicing out side uh-huh um he's a real sports kind of person so he plays tennis with with the kids we all kind of play tennis as a family except the baby plays on the play ground we take turns with her um um-hum uh let's see we have a computer and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer um uh let's see what else we do oh i suppose we watch a little TV together we really don't watch i think as much TV as a lot of people we don't have HBO we do get the Disney channel for the kids um-hum uh-huh uh my kids have the Nintendo which they play and my husband sometimes joins them with that um-hum uh my little girl Jennifer likes to do crafty things and i'll take some time and do that with her and of course we always read a bed time story at night and even the the older kids sometimes sit down and and will join in and listen to a story um uh-huh that's neat basically the story person because my husband doesn't have he gets home from work late or whatever and and usually once in a while he'll read the story to the little one but that's basically my job um yeah so do you find it difficult to find time or is it pretty natural uh-huh it is it is hard because you know at the end of your day you want time for yourself and and it and that's kind of cutting into your your time yeah yeah and with the kids getting older now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late but you know on school nights the two older ones get to bed about nine they go upstairs at nine uh-huh and um now this weekend we'll have a baby sitter come and uh my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home and um probably not too late maybe maybe Brian will still be up and um-hum spend some time with him but it is it's really hard you have to be a very unselfish person to to spend a lot of time with your kids i think yeah yeah do you work during the day uh no i don't work i last year um i had a little part time job in a private um high school tutoring um high school students with learning disabilities that was two days a week and even just those two days um-hum just seemed like it was a lot i don't know how i admire people that that can do it all but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way i i want it kept it is hard yeah yeah i can imagine yeah um even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything and that's another thing i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping um usually on the weekend and um-hum that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son and and they'll be my helper and then they'll get to pick out some of the favorite snacks that they get to pick out so try to do things like that but it you know it's it's uh um-hum yeah yeah and then of course they have a pretty um busy social calendar too you fit it in with all that the that uh-huh yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in America i i think a lot of people a lot of people sit sit their kids in front of the TV and HBO and rent movies and and um-hum kind of leave them to their own means um i think you know it's very very easy to fall into that trap and i'm not um totally innocent of that because there's times when you just stay here watch a tape but um yeah um-hum yeah um i think different parts of the country i think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids people are real um-hum sports conscious and really get involved with their kids sports activities and you know but um oh that's good yeah yeah well families are facing a challenge i know that with i'm a newlywed and we're you know thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years and what um-hum um-hum and it's it's very hard because when you get used to two salaries it's very hard to to cut back to one and um um yeah but you know if you have the type of job i have a friend that's a nurse and she can pick her hours and that's a a great career i i wish i would have gone into uh nursing because she has such a flexible schedule but it's very hard to uh um-hum yeah spend time with the children and uh and your husband and um-hum do everything at once yeah but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because well i think it's a big it's a big um responsibility you just don't have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single yeah yeah when you have children you have to say now this is different and you do have to give things up i i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child um um-hum for the at least for the first two years of their lives i mean if you can possibly swing it because they yeah  guess what what you know Diane Lancaster did you ever meet her she was at she was at your wedding yeah the blonde hair okay okay she is transcribing these tapes for TI oh you're kidding no well hi Diane really hey Suzy how you doing oh this is too crazy well i i'm glad i'm glad it's you dear because whenever i first heard the

department uh-huh um-hum and uh learning what i'm going to need to be doing on on that side of the business so you're not going to stay down there in Miami not uh not long term then after a week or two in Houston i'll either come back to Miami or i'll go to Bermuda uh-huh and uh i don't know it's still pretty loosey-goosey huh hum well that's interesting i was wondering you know what are you doing down there anyway well what i'm i mean i'm working i mean like i would you know like i did at well no now i mean after work oh well shoot you know what one of the things about this i mean i i don't get off work until uh well we don't well we don't leave the office until sometimes it's seven o'clock at night like six oh yeah and we've been staying real late cause it's a lot going on yeah and then for about oh gosh the first three nights i had dinners to go to oh yeah yeah yeah you know we have to go out and dine and then you heading into the corporate apartment yeah and then by the time you know you get in and you're living out of a suitcase and you know kind of get settle down i do a little reading hell it's bedtime for me yeah and uh tonight for instance i left the office early and uh i'm going to uh i was just sitting down here and i was watching the news i thought well let me see if i can get this call over with you know and uh yeah because i've got the guy that's coming in from New York his his plane comes in about seven thirty and whenever he gets back yeah and whenever he gets back to the airport here tonight yeah he flies down to Aruba tomorrow but whenever he gets back to the airport here tonight he's going to give me a call we're going to have dinner together because he wants to talk with me about some more stuff um-hum you know so yeah and then but what i'm going to do tomorrow i'm going to get up and go get my haircut um-hum and uh got to get some shirts out of the laundry and then i'm headed to the beach ooh i don't blame you yeah i don't blame you yeah it it i think's it's going to be a pretty day it's been about is it warm down there yeah it's about eighty degrees today oh shit it's only fifty five here i hate it oh no well it's about eighty is the sun out oh yeah oh no beautiful how awful we're looking at rain all weekend no not again oh horrors yes yes oh really so you're not staying down there for the whole two months well anyway don't no huh-uh no see i'm going to be going back and forth oh oh i see i see and like i said i'm going to be going to Bermuda some and then i think i'll i think probably i'll make another trip to Aruba between now and the time i move down there although i may there's a possibility that i may move be moving down there as early as the end of February yeah wow i know it wow but  okay uh do you know you know what the topic is music right what type do you like i like uh pretty much rock popular rock okay what kind do you like uh i like rock semi classical soft jazz not heavy rock um-hum um-hum um i can get into soft jazz too yeah i don't like uh country particularly or rap or um what else no country turns me off uh the my my girlfriend likes rap i don't like you're kidding yeah definitely strange but uh i i never got much i mean every so often there is like a song out that just sounds funny when you listen to it and those are probably the only kind i like but uh rap in general like i don't get into um-hum so who's your favorite artist right now um i i actually have a couple of favorite artists i i like guys like you know Billy Joel uh who are singers song writers you know i mean who are great he's one of my favorites yeah he's i i love him i i had his greatest hits uh and i had to have it on i have it on tape i have it on CD and i have it on record what my tape went bad so i bought a record then my record went bad so i bought a CD what is your very favorite song that Billy Joel has done probably Piano Man really yeah i uh maybe maybe just because it is like on i think it is the first one on the on the CD um-hum and it's the first one on the tape too and i just listen to it a lot and i just i just love it my very favorite is still rock and roll to me hm that is a good one you ever see the video uh by Billy Joel uh it's not it's uh another one about uh he is in a courtroom and he has you something like Keeping the Faith that's the name of the song and in the video he uh he's actually in court yes i think so and and uh Christi Brinkley's in it yeah that's another reason i like him he's like married to the girl i love you know well then he has another video that she's been in uh he's like uh uh i think it is Uptown Girl and that's the first one that i had seen her in she is just so gorgeous uh-huh right right um-hum i know i know no uh the the Keeping the Faith is great because uh you see you know all these people in the courtroom and they have these girls dancing on the railings on the sides uh-huh um-hum and i just got a kick out of it it was just really funny well the other one that he came out with and i loved the video for it too uh it was i think on his last CD uh We Didn't Start the Fire uh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah he oh i just love that song he he just has the ability i mean every so often he'll just come out with uh you know a couple of the songs that are just great yeah um-hum does he have anything new out do you know no i haven't heard anything lately um but then again i haven't bought any CDs lately i had a CD player and i just moved from Washington about two years ago and uh when i was in Washington in DC i i gave my CD player to my sister because i was going to buy another one uh-huh and you never bought another one and and well i have one now but i just got it it's like two months ago so i i just uh recently have started going back into the CD market yes did you get one that loads more than one or did you get a single yeah i got the the five disc carousel that's what we have and i'll tell you it's a lot nicer because you can you know sometimes i get tired of listening to the same artist over you know for the whole entire length of the CD and it's nice when you can randomly choose them too oh yeah um-hum um-hum oh yeah yeah i that's what i really like and i bought a little single disc for my car um-hum um-hum and uh that's great i mean i every since i put that thing in my car i haven't heard a tape since yeah i'd like to have one of those next car i buy i don't know how expensive they are when you are putting them in um-hum well i just i just got a little portable one and i bought a little they Sony makes a base unit that you can just mount in your car and so the whole package was under two hundred dollars uh-huh um-hum um-hum oh that's great yeah otherwise i mean if you buy them in a car now it's like five hundred bucks for a whole unit um-hum ooh that might be a little bit more than my budget yeah yeah that's that's a little extravagant you know but if you can afford the cars that it can come into you know it's not that bad but do you go to any concerts or anything i haven't been to any uh since i've been out of college um and it usually the concerts that have come up lately i have been out of town uh traveling so i just haven't had the chance to go to any um-hum um-hum you know and i work with a bunch of young people in the office they're always going to concerts but whenever they tell me there's one coming up there's something going on and i can never go so i know i haven't been to any i've been missing out on life well there is someone that i just discovered like in the last couple of years and have you ever heard of Yanni um-hum of who Yanni uh name the name sounds familiar he's a composer he's dating Linda Evans right now and he does i first heard when uh i first moved to Dallas about five years ago there was uh a station that played soft rock and light jazz uh-huh um-hum and i did not think i liked jazz at all until i started listening to this station and Yanni is one of these i guess he's kind of new wavish or something hum i think that's where i saw Yanni was there was something about him dating Linda Evans that 's probably right exactly but his music is absolutely wonderful and i've kind of gotten into a little bit of this new age or new wave or whatever it may be and uh there's a lot of that that i like a is it really hum um-hum hum  okay okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and it's it's really making me wanna exercise because every single woman in the audience is oh about ten pounds oh so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last about last Spring when i i joined the President's Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh um-hum i went pretty regularly but it's hard to go regularly for a long time um-hum and where i live in Waco uh they don't have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's so now i don't have a club and i'm i don't have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that so i'm not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but um-hum i just don't like just running with no where to go and i just can't do that so um-hum well i understand that i've been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought that'd be the time to get going um-hum and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so she's not around um and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i don't seem to find time in the day time and of course it's motivation that's keeping me from really looking for that opportunity yeah yeah yeah i think a lot of times if you have someone to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh oh yeah sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going yeah yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise um-hum um-hum oh yeah and that's something that i'm motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but um-hum i um all the same it's connected to my attitude because i'm not feeling as perky and good i'm also it's hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there that's very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise yeah yeah and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesn't yeah yeah and you have less less chance of of hurting yourself yeah it doesn't you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because she's supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had so um-hum pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later wow wow so and i'd never had that problem before but i guess age is starting to catch up to me it's showing up in the weirdest places yeah uh oh huh i guess my favorite my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just with the the stationary bikes to just ride oh is it and if you're watching television they usually have television in there or something or if you're listening to a walkman it's pretty it's pretty okay yeah yeah again that's sort of weird because you're you've not going anywhere and it i i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point uh-huh yeah you know it was there was points you could you you would make and you know there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere it's just because i don't i just can't understand that so i don't do it yeah well i've got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so that's a little less try you know uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and oh yeah um-hum hum yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls yeah oh yeah you know like early in the mornings things like that i never tried that yeah i don't know i've i never really even thought about it really that's kind of an idea uh we we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center that's got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year oh but i find it very tedious because i'm watching the clock constantly and it's just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than oh i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles um-hum um  do work in a large organization now um well i i work in a actually it's sort of an odd situation right now but uh i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization uh-huh and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago uh-huh but it's it's not really a large organization but uh nearly nearly five hundred people uh-huh oh yeah that's pretty big yeah how about yourself are you i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees that's uh-huh i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um besides salary it seems that people if it's a large enough place need to feel that their job's an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss hum yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh yeah yeah it's it's more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one ooh yeah i i think it it's probably the thing is that it's always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah right everyone's so integral yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that it's it's generally important um-hum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too but um um-hum what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know in a larger yeah yeah when it when i've worked with a with i mean the the small things i've worked with really haven't had any uh any consistent yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i i've had my own little business and then i've worked for small businesses really in health care uh-huh and yeah the the the only ones that i've had large uh uh i mean i've had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations uh-huh vacation and also i work for the university and that that's a is very large organization and uh and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits i you you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean it's it's it's handy to have them i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um uh-huh uh-huh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without um typically let's see uh typically the myself i i was covered myself but my family wasn't you know i had to chip in to for them to be covered but it was pretty economical um-hum um-hum um especially relative to just buying your own health care package right that really gets prohibitive yeah and so you know so that's that's handy uh you know i think that it i'm amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean it's something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary yes i've heard that too and which is which is pretty amazing it is especially especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use that much hopefully they budget for that and it doesn't get used up entirely but um-hum it's it's a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office that's elsewhere but he doesn't um-hum he didn't really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organization's benefits i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that it it actually it's interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to it's uh ten or fifteen thousand um-hum um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it right are the rest of the package is pretty good it's vision and dental and you know all the full medical oh well um-hum yeah that's good i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think yeah um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking you know i've seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i haven't yet at our hospital we've kind of been waiting with baited breath we're the only hospital that i know of that doesn't have uh um-hum a partial payment or i don't know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer oh uh-huh copayment uh uh-huh so as as of this date my husband and my kids are free because they're dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if right yeah i i mean i typically you typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i i've the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um you know they don't wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand they're real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping exactly  okay have you ever your family have reunions on any regular basis probably once every five years once every five years um-hum yeah um you have a pretty big family yeah and the hardest part about getting the family the stuff together is everyone's spread out all over Timbuktu oh yeah and you yeah we've got a pretty big family but most of us live well i'm well i'm originally from West Virginia um-hum most of the family is right in the West Virginia area uh what they call the Tristate area uh northern West Virginia Eastern Ohio and Southwestern Southwestern Pennsylvania yeah most everybody is right in that area that makes it a lot easier a lot more convenient that's why we only do it once every five or ten years because it's like that hard to get everyone together yeah yeah they put one together for our family about once every June it was on my grandmother's birthday but she's she's gone now yeah see that's kind of what happened with ours that's why we hadn't had one in a long time yeah um so so to make one successful what i mean what do y'all do do y'all just start planning real far ahead of time oh shoot pardon do you um do y'all start planning real far ahead of time well no there's kind of a set pattern to it there's uh so the day it happens is ninety eight percent of the planning usually oh really yeah oh the we get together at the the uh the park uh the uh park and playground area of the church i was raised in yeah and uh everybody brings lots of food and we'll put up a volleyball net just sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat eat a lot see it's a lot harder for us because we're like i say we're spread out so they have to plan anywhere from six well really probably a year ahead of time so everyone can say um oh goodness yeah scheduled vacation time their their vacation time yeah we usually just Saturday Saturday uh Sunday afternoon um-hum or maybe sometimes it's been like on Saturday afternoon usually it's like Sunday afternoon and most people don't have more than you know a couple hours drive tops to get there and back yeah now is that where you're i mean is well where i'm calling from is southern Mississippi so we got a ways uh uh my wife and i have a bit longer ways to go than most but y'all still manage to make them uh actually we've only made one of them since we got married about four years ago one of the family reunions but we're both in school so it makes it kind of tough yeah yeah they usually they been happening um just after the summer semester starts you can't really get away so usually not we managed to get to one that was before i started to school and she took that summer off but uh well now that we've been talking about it i'm gonna i'm kind of getting home sick now because it's been over three years since i've been home oh yeah oh goodness to see my grandparents or well my my grandfather's the only one that's still around yeah and see my grandmother was the one that used to plan the stuff basically yeah so unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together it's kind of like she was like the glue so yeah i understand where is home for you originally um i was born in Missouri yeah so and you know we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana Mississippi um here in Texas so it's harder for everyone to get in get home yeah yeah well maybe this year you can find a more central location now well but see the majority of them are in like just like how you said in close close quarters so it's easier for us few stragglers to go home oh okay okay the majority of them are still in the Missouri area yeah okay yeah our family right now or most there's there's there's only like few stragglers uh if any with any distance yeah some of us there's one cousin uh in Colorado and uh some cousins over in Phoenix uh i got a sister over in in uh Washington state well uh rest of them are within you know a couple hours drive well um how do y'all communicate like to plan it and everything do y'all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we're gonna do it or do y'all like mail out stuff that's pretty much it yeah okay it's gonna be such and such a weekend and uh y'all come that's about it yeah i mean you know this is the standard pattern is the everybody brings their their favorite dish and somebody brings the volleyball net somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon and well um i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i hadn't seen in probably ten over ten years it was like don't you remember me and i'm like no am i related to you yeah i married your cousin's brother's uncle uh something like that yeah i know do you i mean is that since you i mean do you have them every year uh yeah they're every year and and still you wind up meeting people you you you never knew you were related to let alone well see it's probably not that yeah yeah well i think that's probably why our's always so interesting is because we don't have them that often and then when we do yeah and everyone does finally get together it's like after the you know the just like down right amazing isn't it yeah  did you see in the newspaper or on the news when uh President Bush fainted at a dinner it was was that in Japan that was in Japan uh i didn't get to see that uh we've uh just gotten back yesterday from vacation um and so i was bumping up and down the highway in a camper and uh i didn't get to watch any television so i've just been finding out about this once i got back well i thought it was pretty scary i i missed it uh i mean i when they were rerunning rerunning it like the next day or something i mean i didn't hear about it on the day it happened but i it was interesting you know that when he fainted and every one kind of jumped up on the table and surrounded him and it's really amazing that that would happen and then of course all the Dan Quayle discussion comes up again yeah well i was kind of pleased that uh when i got back that that was the hot item on the news that uh the President had fainted at dinner because that means that nothing else happened anywhere in the world that's uh that is true that is real good well he you know as for as young as he is he seems to have had several health problems you know health uh incidences if not problems yeah well you need about three kids running around the house and uh you you'd have your share of health problem too right that's right well i um i guess i haven't really been i've been trying to tune out a lot of the political issues right now when because the campaigning is starting and uh so yeah well i think the key issue that's going on at the moment is the uh uh current economy um-hum and i think there's a lot of things that need to be done to to rectify that situation i'm not sure that the government is the key player right um it is scary i think one of the statements that was made uh a year ago by uh Gorbachev when he was announcing some of the problems that existed in the Soviet Union he made the comment he said well our country may be bankrupt but referring to the United States he says your schools are bankrupt yes and uh that's been a big concern for me and i noticed that uh when i go into the tougher courses at some of the universities like Organic Chemistry or something like that uh-huh that uh you don't find very many white American males taking the tough courses right they're foreign students you find you find a lot of Asian students uh you find uh a lot of females in the class um-hum and in all of the tough courses that i have taken the only blacks that i've found in the class have have generally been from Nigeria or some other African country they're foreign students um-hum and it's i think it's kind of pathetic that uh our kids are not motivated to uh to study in depth and uh to take the hard courses and i'm i'm concerned that that is our economic problem not not how much money is being spent at Christmas time well they seem well that's really true and but i have noticed from uh my associations with teenagers in high school that they are really motivated by how much money they can make and when they hear on the news about people being laid off and uh you know corporations and things i mean i feel like they don't wanna make the effort out of um their own personal interests to follow a particular field or they wanna think you know how quickly can they make money um-hum and they're not attracted by the the work that has to be done to achieve uh you know a position like that yeah well i know when i went through school uh i went through an engineering school and of all my close friends they were all there because they loved engineering um-hum they loved building things they loved solving problems uh they liked you know being creative and there was another group of students there that were there to be engineers because they heard that engineers made a lot of money right and we didn't mix very well you know there was a a total difference in attitude and we felt very isolated or uh discriminated against in not being you know separate classes in terms of attitude um-hum um-hum well you're right when you say that um the important issues need to be not so as much what's going on other places i mean that it's important for us to do i mean we we can't be isolated here but um you know we do need to pay more attention to our own economy and um-hum and our own civilization because we've seen how quickly and it's almost unbelievable the fall of the um Soviet Union and and the um Berlin Wall and all of that's almost unreal to me still yeah well that was a terribly precarious economy economy uh i've been kind of watching it over the years and observing that the the amount of bureaucracy over there  uh do you have kids oh yeah i got three how about yourself um we have two and another one on the way oh you've got uh young children then well we have yeah we do we have a our six a six year old he's oldest and then um our baby will be a year on Monday oh my goodness that's great yeah yeah what kind of mix do you have a boy and a girl or two boys two boys yeah two boys you know what's on the way yet are you no i i'm just about three months and um i don't think we really even wanna find out we like surprises so we'll take either i don't blame you well well well we got two boys and a girl also well we got two boys and a girl well uh and and does does it are the two boys first yes yes so maybe maybe maybe you'll get lucky and get a girl this time oh maybe huh we we kind of like our boys though too so well our boys one is uh he's in graduate school at A&M uh he's in the Navy he's a lieutenant in the Navy and the Navy's sending him for his Master's in ocean engineering and oh my goodness we got another boy that's uh out in Maryland he's a wildlife biologist uh oh and our girl is thirteen she's in uh seventh grade so we got still all sorts of good activities with with her oh yeah you've kind of got uh a span there huh oh well what do you do with your seventh grader well she's into a little bit of everything she's uh loves riding horses so she goes out riding as much as she can and do do you have horses no no she just she knows people that does huh well uh yeah but mainly at a riding place that's north of town that she goes uh she rides English and does jumping takes lesson and all that kind of stuff yeah oh does she oh she must really like them and yeah she's into oh she plays the flute in the band and piccolo and she's into this uh odyssey of the mind thing which is uh takes a lot of time for it's uh for what they call pace group i don't know if you've gotten into that with your kids but that's for the kind of well it's a program for advanced higher the advanced kids yeah yeah yeah yeah i have heard of that our little little boy's just in the first grade and and i i taught school sure oh okay for six years so i i do know about that program and and

uh history is what their peace classes is this year but uh so they they uh oh uh-huh she enjoys that kind of stuff and does well with it so yeah oh that's neat challenging huh oh yeah yeah always something to do yeah well um as far as our activities we're kind of on a different level here but my well you'll get to different levels i guarantee you that yeah yeah my husband's gonna take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight uh okay they they like to both boy things yeah that'd be fun oh yeah yeah but uh we we don't have any real um like we don't really ski we haven't taken our kids skiing or anything course the baby's young but got to wait a couple years sledding that's what you got to do tobogganing yeah yeah he's the what you got to go tobogganing and sledding with them uh oh well yeah we we have done that he in fact he just goes right out here we've got quite a bit of snow now and last week we got a lot well you're welcome to keep that yeah you don't like that huh well i grew up in Wisconsin i i had plenty of snow and when i was a kid and oh we've lived here about seventeen years but we used to take all the kids tobogganing and ice skating and all that kind of stuff the boys and it's a lot of fun really yeah it is fun as long as you don't have to drive in it yeah i no i don't like that i really i it makes me nervous yeah i had plenty of snow to last me forever i i don't care if i ever see any well i don't care if i see it but just keep it off of here yeah yeah oh i don't mind it but uh us um the winter gets long yes you know i get ready if that come about this time of year i'm kind of ready for it to start getting spring and it's too early yet so well you got you got you got five months before you'll see that yeah we do we do we've had a few early springs though the last few years they haven't been too bad come about March it it gets you know a lot nicer and oh yeah our our oldest son when uh yeah  okay what um do you watch much TV or you know um no i don't watch much TV sometimes um usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news but i don't think of that every day even the news yeah uh-huh um i think i get most of my current events well i get them from everywhere i sometimes watch TV if i i guess i watch TV if i haven't read the paper that day we don't get a paper but i work um at a i teach college class and uh there's a the library has a paper and so i often drop in on a break and oh uh-huh yeah and read it and then i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home um-hum and then i i figure if there's big big news i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or someone else you know yeah yeah now i also i get it from all over i watch the news every day and i have we have a news you know we get the newspaper and uh uh-huh um magazines anything anything you know i'm i read a lot so i get um you know i'm i'm really up on uh current affairs i get you know uh-huh the news and and everything yeah what's your favorite news do you do you get a news magazine or um well i'm not getting any no i'm not getting any news magazines but um uh-huh you know as as i said i do uh it's uh it's easy to keep up on current events you know on certainly you know especially when you um you know you get a paper every day yeah yeah we've got yeah and uh yeah exactly are you satisfied with the quality of coverage uh i don't know is there anything missing i you know i yeah it's kind of hard to know isn't it and i don't know you know what what's i mean what are we supposed to uh compare it to you know i mean the quality uh uh-huh whatever they tell you you know i uh i guess i'm uh i you know i'm satisfied i mean i uh you you you know they're they're supposedly covering everything that happens so you know yeah yeah well i do feel like a little bit like being from California and wanting to hear like i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something and i don't ever hear it in the news here you know it's um oh really oh well uh sometimes it's such a you know it's it's so um slight you know like the tremors are so slight that they don't even bother putting it in the yeah yeah paper but most of the time the times i find that even if there are you know they do have like tremors out there uh you know there'll be a small article in the paper about it yeah yeah but um yeah i sometimes feel like um the Dallas paper and the Dallas News um the top headlines are always a murder you know and that's because there's a high crime rate yeah oh well that's what sells papers yeah that's um that's been like that since they the first newspaper you know yeah yeah i'm sure you know but um i don't know i i guess i'm satisfied i don't uh uh-huh i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really we don't get a you know yeah really that's true we certainly get enough coverage i mean we we we can get news you know i mean there's even the C N N channel where we can get world news twenty four hours a day so oh yeah i was gonna sure yeah sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad yeah it's all so negative you know yeah but often times so yeah well we have to keep talking i guess well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're oh oh is it really um yeah have you always gone until the recording well yeah i don't i don't uh uh-huh oops i guess we're not supposed to i don't know we're supposed i guess we're supposed to wait or yeah i don't know uh-huh cause i you know like one well was it last week we were supposed to talk about gardening uh-huh uh and it was really funny i i i mixed it made the call and it happened to be my friend who lives a few blocks away oh really it just yeah and it was really we were laughing i mean but you know we don't really do any gardening so like that took like a minute uh-huh and then we just talked about you know whatever i mean uh-huh interesting yeah you know i mean some topics really now you know now this topic this is i mean there really isn't much to say after um-hum you know you uh you know you you tell a person what uh news their a you know where their where they find their sources of of information from and then you know if if it's uh if they're satisfied and that's about it really yeah um-hum it's hard to talk for five minutes on this yeah so um yeah well i guess i can just say i uh it bothers me that i hear a lot about um you know on the news that well it seems like i don't know some things are sensationalized or some things are um you know you'll hear one report and then you'll hear that it you know they didn't um  okay okay well i think this is going to probably be the most difficult topic that i've discussed so far yes well have you returned anything lately really you know i just did last week as a matter of fact um i'm wondering if their subject is more uh products by mail or things that you buy at the store but um i bought something through the mail through a merchant through a company that's generally got pretty good products and i was really impressed with the way they handled the return policy they sent UPS to our door to pick it up free of charge which is such a an unusual always have to go to the post office or some place to return it usually uh-huh was this Spiegel by any chance it was Hannah Anderson the children's um clothing don't know that one i know Spiegel does that and yes and uh to me that's very impressive to think that do they it really is but well and did you have any problem obviously had no problem with returning it it took a while because it was the holiday weeks um oh well it was difficult to know when the person was going to arrive we're we're fortunate in that my husband works most of the time out of our home so he was here but it would've probably been an inconvenience if if it had been a home pickup and and we hadn't been here but they were also willing to pick up at work um-hum did did you return it because it was defective or because you just didn't like it it was defective we returned it for the same thing um in a little larger size but it seemed that it was stitched uh around the collar such that the second time she wore it it uh it ripped huh and and i think that's unusual for that company because they do usually have pretty good products but to to answer the question that we were posed about whether things tend to be poor quality i think definitely i think a lot of the things that um are not necessarily low price tend to be manufactured in a lot of cases as if they were lower priced well i know what you mean because a couple years ago i remember i was in one of the nicer department stores and looking at it was one of the designer T-shirts or some sort of thing like that and the thing um-hum it was very expensive you know as they always are and it was a piece of junk you know stitching was terrible i think that they were trying to just you know play on a name yeah exactly yeah and it it's unfortunate you really cannot depend on the the department store's name for that necessarily i don't know if you have Nordstroms in Dallas um-hum no we don't i've been to one of the Nordstroms in um uh New York um-hum nice store they are really nice stores and i think i assumed in the beginning that they would probably carry carry overall pretty good merchandise you you have to be just as careful there as you do at any other lower priced store do you really yeah surprisingly do you have Lord and Taylor there no um uh we're originally from Saint Louis and we came down to Dallas and they have Lord and Taylors here and i look at a lot of their house brands and i am very impressed with the quality of some of the house brands in some of the stores um-hum um-hum does Nordstroms carry their own house brand um you know i don't know that i bet they probably do but i i'm not sure that i've associated some of what i've seen as lines that they always carry as their own brand or just something that they've um gotten at a at a lower uh price because it's a large volume some of their children's lines um-hum um-hum i tend to look there for kids' things because they don't they they sometimes have things that you can't find elsewhere because they have a pretty large variety but not often for myself do you shop by mail quite a bit not that much actually i used to i think before i had a child and because you end up paying for the shipping and handling and everything um it's not as inexpensive and you don't always have the convenience of returning it if it's not right uh i i tend less often to do that today than i might've ten years ago um-hum that's the only problem that i see because uh my sister gets tons of catalogs and passes them on to me and i look at things and they have some gorgeous clothes but the problem is that um-hum you can't always go by sizes you know you'll go to a department store and try on three different sizes in three different manufacturers and they all fit you know differently but uh that's the main thing is that i can't tell exactly um-hum um-hum whether the thing is going to fit or not um-hum and so i tend not to mail order whereas you might take a chance in a store and bring it home and consider it you but i you find that it's a lot more inconvenient to have to have to arrange for returning it if it's by mail well personally i always try on before i buy anyway i just it amazes me when i talk to people that they buy like they buy a bunch of clothes and they don't try anything on they take them home oh really no i meant even if you've tried it on i i'm thinking about some clothes buying for kids or your husband or something it oh okay well that's a different story right yeah it is funny you know i'm also amazed at uh that i read about those i don't know anybody who does this but that people buy clothes and wear them and then think that they can return them i hear about that too and that just appalls me i mean that's stealing really that's what  child care or uh no actually i'm still single are you yeah but my mom uh she teaches at a uh child care center oh does she what yeah uh you've heard of Kinder Care yeah i have yeah it's a big chain she uh she teaches up in uh up in the Washington area uh-huh matter of fact it's a pretty big business yeah it is my wife teaches is teaches at this uh little small family owned one here in Utah but uh uh-huh i don't know what do you think about it do they have a lot of those up in Utah uh they do actually there's quite a few and getting more and more seems like yeah they're they're growing really really fast i remember uh i i worked with a bunch of people uh uh for the summer and she was trying and one of the ladies there who drove me there she was trying to put her daughter in child care and it was the the competition is pretty fierce you know um-hum yeah uh some places uh charge a lot of money and offer all sorts of amenities um-hum some places are like really cheap but uh you know they like have a it's like a home or something an old home they just hire a bunch of people and have a big yard and let the kids play back there yeah uh-huh play all day yeah and so what was she looking for when she was out around well she was um she was looking for something cheap obviously uh someone to take care of her kid but that at the same time she didn't want you know some people that were like a bunch of teenagers you know yeah yeah just out there working because some people do that they'll just go to high school or something get some kids who work for five dollars an hour and get them out there and that's all they really care about you know uh-huh yeah but uh some places like uh they have uh they set up a gym you know like a jungle gym and uh they they emphasize like athletics and stuff like that but those kinds of places get pretty expensive and it's really for the yuppies yeah yeah yeah well my wife i mean they they have a prepared you know little school school type lessons for them and stuff but um-hum but the kids sometimes are so rowdy and want to be outside that that stuff doesn't go over too well she she's not too set on the whole thing i mean it's a job for her she has to take it but yeah uh she's not too she'd rather almost just get a somebody she knows you know personally and have them babysit her you know her kids hum yeah my uh that's that's what uh what my mom you know thinks is the best way to do it you know if you know someone uh who's willing to take care of the person who's willing to take care of the kids that that uh you know that you can trust if she had to um-hum yeah that's probably the best way to do it because sometimes you know i i don't know if you saw the thing on uh some news i think on ABC one time they was showing how people the some of the people were just smacking the kids around you know yeah yeah her yeah well that was and that was what really kind kind of scared us is because well we we have a daughter and she goes with her but she's in a different class and my wife will poke her head downstairs and she'll see the lady screaming at the kids and stuff and i'm just going wait a minute you know i mean um-hum um she's a year and half you you know eighteen months old um-hum yeah you can't be screaming at them too much but yeah really it seems uh i don't know i was pretty i'm not i i don't like them i think how many kids do you have we just have one just a little daughter eighteen months and just one yeah i said i it's the only reason you know she the only reason we have my wife working is that she can work with her she can go to work with her otherwise it's um-hum is it expensive up there well we i think they usually charge about twelve bucks a day so i think we're pretty cheap i heard once that like out in Boston it could be upwards of four hundred dollars a month and here you and yeah yeah it it can get real expensive i remember i worked at a place in Washington called Intelsat um-hum and uh the building also house WJLA and they had a it was the child care facility was on one of the floors in the building um-hum um-hum and uh they would charge i think the rate was eight hundred dollars a month for child care but the convenience was that the kid was in the same building as you were and it was a and gee yeah but you know the kind of money you have to make to make that even worthwhile i mean you know to pay eight hundred bucks out of your income oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah but uh the the child care facility was really top notch they had uh the where the kids were was i mean the right above it was an executive uh room for the WJLA right below it was an executive room for WJLA and it's all glass yeah uh-huh oh really so i mean there's really nothing they couldn't do they could do that uh you know that nobody could see you know so everything was pretty much under uh you know uh supervision yeah uh-huh yeah and since uh the building was built on a park on park land they had plenty of land to go out and just play around if they wanted to and um-hum yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's oh yeah i mean you can go visit your kids during the day you know and see see how they're doing yeah go have lunch with them and stuff like that but that sounds pretty cool yeah but but anyway well i think we got our three minutes yeah hey well it's been good talking to you hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye all right see you later bye bye  okay uh what kind of fishing is there up in Utah well there's quite a quite a bit of different kinds lot of people go uh stream fishing and we have a a few lakes uh right now they're uh doing a little bit of ice fishing on some of the lakes i personally don't fish a lot fish a great deal uh got kind of a young family it's you know it's not something that we're really into there's couple of good trout farms that are close by that we go fish at just with the kids for fun yeah yeah how about yourself what do you enjoy well i was i was raised on Alabama coast and i like salt water fishing oh and Dallas is there's quite a few lakes around here i've done some fishing from the shore i don't have a boat which you really need to get out into the lakes uh you know really do any good uh-huh i've i've caught a few striped bass from the shore some of the small ones yeah and then catfish and stuff i haven't done a lot since i moved to Dallas how long you been there oh off and on for ten years we were here six years and my wife got homesick we moved backed to Alabama Mobile spent about eight months and moved back to Dallas because the uh-huh yeah wages and all were better up here oh i have a the only reason i'm in the program is i've got a brother and a well a sister that lives in Plano and so they uh they uh get involved in this we went out to a lake one time when i was visiting them i can't even remember what it was called it was a pretty good sized one seem like there were a few guys fishing there from the shore is all yeah uh i never caught anything or never been uh salt salt water fishing that sounds like you know kind of be a lot of fun i've seen these guys that well you go on a vacation and they go out in the big boat and right go deep sea fishing you ever done that yeah i did that a couple of times the company i had worked for in Mobile they had a couple of bunch of us guys got together and we and chartered a boat and uh-huh went out caught red snapper and one guy caught a ling oh and i caught a few what they call trigger fish uh-huh but the it wasn't some of the snappers that much not that much fun they don't really i mean uh yeah they they don't fight at all it's just pulling dead weight you know they don't fight is that right yeah and we'd constantly getting our lines tangled up with people people fishing on both sides of the boat so oh it was one uh fish were good but it was kind of a hassle i got a brother-in-law just got back from a trip to Alaska um and uh he said that was quite a bit of fun uh i guess the salmon are pretty good fighters and uh they went uh out in the you know more of the deep sea fishing as well caught a fair amount of halibut yeah and they say the halibut are are a pretty good fighter too um they're an odd fish i don't know if you ever seen i guess they lie on the flat on the bottom of the ocean and they only have one eye or or just a small eye on the other side okay well we we catch flounder on the coast which is about the same thing as halibut yeah yeah do they put up a fight or not uh well they hug the bottom they they don't run that much but they they somehow they hug the bottom and it's kind of you find it's a pretty good struggle to put them in you know pull them in once they get once you get them over to over to the side of the boat because they're they're pretty pretty weighty fish are they yeah do you net those or i guess you have to huh yeah yeah uh i've caught i've caught one on a hook with live shrimp i've caught several of them in cast nets uh-huh yeah about yeah you would have to net them to get them in the boat because they really have a small mouth and all yeah but i've i've fished mostly you know when i was on the coast in the in the bays and stuff in a little you know plywood skiff yeah and well the water's kind of brackish so i i catch a mixture of salt water and fresh water fish right with right on the coast you know i catch catfish in the bayou and go uh-huh a half a mile and catch a you know salt water fish you know i've never eaten catfish are they good eating yeah they they real good they uh-huh and so that i guess you know people on the coast and all consider them that's the best around is that right yeah kind of an ugly looking fish are they great big whiskers on them yeah they they yeah they are and they're bottom feeders if you uh-huh if you get them out of real muddy water then they got a muddy taste to them but if you oh yeah you know catch them out of clear running water they they're pretty good taste a little better yeah well these trout that we catch are real good i i quite enjoy those uh they this place where we go with uh with my six year old they uh filet them for you right there for only like ten cents a fish i mean it's well worth it yeah yeah so you just fry them up right  all righty so how what do you think of capital punishment well Texas has capital punishment oh does it yep and uh they go through a set of appeals that lasts seven years and uh there are so many cases here like Sixty Minutes is on right now here there are so many cases here where they proved that they've convicted the wrong person yeah that i'm against it they should just give them life in prison well i feel that way the only exception i think is qualifies for capital punishment is repeat offenders where the offender actually murders people repeatedly right like serial killers or someone who has been convicted more than three times on a murder charge and then gotten out on parole i don't think they should be able to get out on parole and do it again yeah exactly right uh-huh that's the only time i think it's really well like in your state Charles Manson yeah or the guy who killed all those children yeah exactly yeah um-hum and i think i think those types of people deserve capital punishment but i think they should restrict it strictly for repeat offenders or like i said serial killers because i mean a lot of times not a lot of times but quite quite a few times they've convicted innocent people on the first time right um-hum but you know if they've been convicted like three times you know there something's wrong something's going on right so i think that's the only time it's really a necessary yeah i think so too after after it's gone that far then they pretty well have a uh enough proof that that person's the guilty party they can't be rehabilitated rehabilitated either so yeah right but that's really the only time when i agree with it um-hum most of the time i don't think it's a good idea because like you said there have been cases where they've convicted the wrong people yeah just because of circumstances um-hum but in Arizona which is where i'm originally from they had a big thing about capital punishment there because we had like two serial killers within six months caught and they had a big thing about whether they should you know go for capital punishment or not but it's not used in Arizona um-hum so they had a problem with it unfortunately all the people got was sent to jail for a couple of years until they get paroled right i never heard about those unfortunately one of them killed a friend of mine so i was very much involved and when he got out on parole i was like go ahead get out on parole um-hum and after that i had i had to tangle with him and the police caught him the second time and they still wouldn't do anything except send him to jail so yeah i definitely believe if they're repeat offenders they should be something to be done with them other than just sitting there for two years and then getting out and doing it again right but a lot of states have outlawed capital punishment um-hum i don't know which states in general and that's that's the reason that Ted Bundy supposedly went to Florida oh really that was his primary goal was to to have the death penalty hum because he started out in Washington and Oregon and traveled all the way across the country huh i didn't know that they had um Mark Harmon played him they had a movie about it a few years ago yeah really um-hum hum i didn't know that and then of course there was a lot of publicity about it um the days before they killed him yeah um-hum so but and he was really you know he was off the wall so i don't know a lot of the crimes that are done nowadays it's like i think people have to be off the wall to do them but i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders right but i don't know i once i finish law school i'll have more probably more views on it i'll be able to do something about it then and yeah and some of the ways i think that um the way that Texas um executes the prisoners is probably the most humane way they use they do it by injection oh do they yeah instead of you know the electric chair the gas chamber that's yeah you know that would be the more humane way of doing it yeah well they you know they just go to sleep and and then eventually they die yeah instead of being you know fried or or or stuck in a gas chamber until they finally pass on yeah fighting fighting for breath right um-hum but i know a couple of states still believe in the hanging but um-hum i don't i don't go for that either  what kind of hobbies do you find yourself involved with well i find myself involved in um singing with a group at the local community college huh and also embroidering and especially cooking i like to uh cook and uh have been in charge of various events and sometimes i embroider when i have really a bit of spare time yes now it seems you're interested in woodworking what kind of woodworking do you do ah uh woodworking um very little actually uh uh oh no um i thought that's what they said um-hum oh no they they uh they they suggested a variety of possibilities and of whatever hobbies hobbies you can come up with uh no uh oh i see um-hum um-hum my hobbies kind of vary from time to time depending on what kind of time i've got uh i spent twenty years as an auto mechanic i see and i enjoy working with with cars uh i've built a couple of race cars uh um-hum um-hum oh you have uh yeah um oh my also i do enjoy woodworking uh uh cabinet cabinetry type woodworking um-hum um i've done some model building and um-hum different things like that um yeah right now hobbies pretty much tend to be on hold with a twelve week old baby and oh my uh-huh full time student hobbies are a extreme luxury uh-huh you say you say you uh sing with a group in a community college uh yes um what sort of music do you work with well we we work with show music and with uh opera arias and actually we're very fortunate to have a um former opera singer uh from New York who is relocated to Dallas and uh she has taken over the the vocal music department at one of the community colleges here in Dallas and uh she both gives private lessons and has um um-hum um-hum a variety of classes especially on Saturdays for um people that are interested and what i found i've been going over there for about three or four years now and what we found is that there winds up being a core group of us that um keep on coming back yes and uh we give performances at the college and at the uh Botanical Gardens in the spring time and at various retirement homes and things of that nature that sounds like a lot of fun and you can um select whatever things you want to work on for the semester and she'll help you with them and give you um lots of good points and uh it it's a very enjoyable group uh it's not um overly formal that you have to worry it's not professional but it's good and i enjoy it very much yeah those are usually the best sorts yeah uh-huh i you you say show music like Broadway musical type show music right uh-huh i've i've personally done some things from Camelot and from My Fair Lady you know things like that um okay hum those are wonderful shows uh and uh some of the people really are just very fine singers we kind of enjoy one another so uh and and when we go out to those retirement homes or the nursing homes the people are very very appreciative which also makes you very happy that you're able to kind of pick up somebody else's life also so oh yeah yeah yeah well the the chances are these are all all things they're very familiar with and just the chance to have some entertainment and some some variety in their life right um-hum yes at at retirement homes i mean even still there are variety there there're a lot of um-hum retirement homes that try to make it sound like it's a real you know luxury condominium setup but still the you know the bulk of the people living there tend to be living pretty restricted lives oh yes um-hum so something like that can be a lot of fun yeah i i really uh that's really what we have found and also um a lot of the people are very knowledgeable um-hum uh in in the field of music they're just very knowledgeable about a lot of things and they'll come and talk to you afterwards and um yeah yeah you better know your onions but uh it it is something i do enjoy very much so and the other thing i like to do is uh-huh oh yeah uh cook i have um uh uh planned uh menus for various organizations and this year i was asked to take care of uh several luncheons and dinners up at my children's school and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them Italian food oh that sounds  okay uh clothing at work um i work as a news reporter and a lot of i work in a since i work in a small station this is my first job and so oh uh-huh i dress very variedly if that's a word um sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography and so i'll be in jeans one day and uh-huh another day i'll be on camera and so i'll be in a suit and another day i'll come in and i won't know what i'm doing so i'll wear a pant suit in case i have to shoot yeah uh ah so it really varies i try to dress very comfortably i don't really like dressing up at all oh me neither i don't i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that i just i don't know it just it takes too much time out of my day and i don't i don't know yeah yeah same here i don't mind not wearing any makeup yeah i don't mind it at all i um i work at a bakery because i'm a still a a college student um um-hum okay but we we have to wear white pants and um any color T shirt as long as it's not like a bright color like a pastel white pants in a bakery yeah yeah the bakers wear all white and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back and so wow okay what's the name of the bakery Cullentini's oh Italian i guess yeah it's Italian bakery and uh so i don't mind having having to wear a uniform because i don't have to buy you know new clothes and stuff yeah isn't that yeah many clothes yeah that's one thing i would like is just to sort of have i'd i really don't like uniforms oh yeah but just to have something where i don't have to get up and decide what to wear because that just bugs me to death yeah i know i do that every day for school oh oh yeah yeah but i i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and sweats and things yeah when i was in school i was sweat monster i mean that's all i had was sweats and when it time to go out i didn't have anything to wear yeah yeah i know i don't have very many dress clothes but i don't mind i don't need them yet yeah yeah hum i hate shoes if i didn't have to have shoes i wouldn't have them oh really i just i don't know my feet bother me and they're just tedious to go find shoes for me it's just i don't know i wear a size nine oh oh and it i don't know it's just the shoes i get i really either don't like them or they don't fit right and i just wish that i could just go without them hum oh wow i love shoes i always buy shoes yeah oh really oh just the opposite but um let's see what else do i wear um if i were in a bigger market when i do get into a bigger market i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things and uh where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things and i could then i would be able to dress uh-huh more business like and things like that but yeah we're all kind of just out of school at this station and so we're all you know still in sweats really so it's pretty fun though oh i like the look the the like suit look professional like you know look but um-hum i i really don't have much of a opportunity to wear it yeah i like um i'm gonna be a teacher so i'll probably just wear uh casual clothes maybe skirts and some yeah um-hum i like this the uh suits with the they come like with a mini type skirt oh yeah you know and the jacket i like that but yeah that is cute but i'm pretty short i'm five four and so that really doesn't flatter me but i think it looks good on taller people yeah i'm five three and are you yeah anytime i go to the store i mean i i have like two pairs of pants because i can never find any that are short enough for me yeah oh really and it's just oh ridiculous pants too i could do without those pants and shoes oh i like the like stretch pants the cotton ones they're really comfortable with a baggy sweatshirt yeah those are nice those are nice yeah yeah those are nice and tennis shoes my boyfriend's got me these LA Gear they're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes oh yeah and it it's just like a chore to pick up my feet oh because i'm used to wearing the little white ah white girl tennis shoes the little ones yeah oh yeah i have a pair of those yeah and i'm used to those they're just sort of you know like your feet and you don't feel them when you put these things on it's it's yeah you know like exercise or something for your feet it's like and i have to wear them because he gets upset if i don't so so oh yeah so how do people in Wisconsin dress warm this time this time of the year pretty warm sweaters and warm yeah oh yeah i grew up in New York and so i know what warm is is like five pairs of socks and yeah yeah sleeping in sweats and long underwear yeah really my parents keep the house cold  hello hi okay i pressed one so i guess we're recording now okay um as far as spare time they talked about i don't i think who has any spare time but okay um i've got a a six year old and um um well my baby's one today today's his birthday and i'm also i'm expecting and so um um i i don't know i haven't had much spare time lately but okay well i've i have had some because i was working for P I E and they went bankrupt so oh uh-huh i've got quite a bit of spare time right now but i've been making dolls cloth dolls and oh have you oh you you sew the bodies and everything um-hum and uh yeah it's a they're all cloth it's not uh any porcelain at all so you sew you just sew everything up huh oh uh-huh what kind do they have yarn hair or yeah and i make the clothes for them and um no you can get the little curly hair at the craft shop oh uh-huh oh i made some of them with that hair and then uh um don't ask me what the other hair i made it look like um it looked like i made some of them with regular wigs oh did you i went to the flea markets and bought you know like the wigs for a dollar oh uh-huh then i cut a V shape out of the back of them oh my goodness and then sewed them on well it sounds like you're creative they looked really cute oh do you sell them i have sold five of them so far oh have you oh um-hum i just have to get a place where you know i can sell them actually yeah i bet how long does it take you to make one duh uh if i would just work all day long making the clothes and everything probably about two and a half days oh really oh do you enjoy it yeah uh-huh um-hum um so yes i really do and then i also crochet and oh i i i can crochet and knit um actually i started an afghan but it's been a a long time ago probably over a year ago and it's kept sitting in my closet half done right now but that it's a knitting one and yeah yeah i tried knitting first but i don't know i i didn't like it so then i went to crocheting but now i wanna learn how to knit again oh didn't you oh i enjoy yeah i enjoy knitting i i kind of like that but i just i like i say i haven't done it for a while and i do like sewing sometimes i i've made a few of the you know just the little valence curtains in my house and you know um-hum um-hum things like that but it it's just finding the time for these things that you you enjoy but yeah yeah yeah i'd in fact i just bought a Serger in December oh i would love one of those oh that's neat yeah i haven't done everything on it yet you know but just what little bit i have used it for i really like it oh those are wonderful aren't they you know especially making the seams and things like that you know it's it's got such a professional finish on them oh yeah that and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff it it'd be nice to have that yeah so i like that oh that's neat well do you have um uh i guess you're kind of young i was gonna say do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for and well fifty seven's not young but no my son's not has has has been married for almost ten years but they don't have any children oh uh-huh so i just make clothes for my dolls oh well well how did you get involved in that just um you know just like sewing and stuff and decided to to buy a pattern and you just try to make a doll so you did buy a pattern and then started from there huh and they it turned out really cute yeah you got to have a pattern for the body you know uh-huh uh-huh have have you ever seen those bunnies that they dress yeah i've i did make some clothes for one of those and and uh yes yes aren't they cute dress one of those yeah i have quite a few of them actually in my house i and most of them i have bought um already clothed but i did i did make the dress on one of them i kind of made the pattern up it's not it's probably not the best but i um-hum um-hum no i i bought a bunny pattern one time but when i sewed it up the face of it looked like a mouse oh it did oh um-hum see it was too pointed oh so i tore it back apart again and i haven't tried another one you haven't sewn it back up huh no but i bought a little lamb pattern and the material and everything to make it out of but i haven't made it yet uh-huh uh do you do any kind of painting or anything no i don't paint except i stenciled my wall uh-huh oh uh-huh i tried i tried that i did i i ended up just stenciling a um a blind like a just a roller shade but i i can i had a hard time stenciling for some reason i just couldn't do it um-hum oh really and people have told me it's very easy oh yeah i my neighbor did it first and i seen her house and i saw how beautiful it looked so then i decided well i was gonna do it well and um it turned out really really good what design did you use uh mostly flowers oh uh-huh and what room you know i've done it in all uh all my rooms have you i've put it in the bedrooms in the bathroom  um are you from this area i'm from Dallas yeah oh okay i'm in Garland so well i'm in Dallas right now but i'm living in Garland um okay um-hum well i don't know if you know but Garland has got a real big recycling center that in fact we went to yesterday you drive up and you take the stuff out of your trunk and they have different bins for the different materials like clear glass and colored glass and plastics and uh they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom that's pretty neat my my daughter is four and she's real interested in recycling so we're we're trying to promote that because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away but um-hum we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them uh does Dallas have a curbside recycling program yet um well i don't know if Dallas is Richardson does oh okay um they started with newspapers and uh of course aluminum cans and and bottles and plastic yeah i didn't know there were different types of plastic though hum yeah um like soda bottles are one kind one type of plastic and milk jugs are one type of plastic you can tell it's got it'll most of the recyclable containers have a little symbol on the bottom with little with the arrows around it that tells whether it's a one or a two or a three um-hum oh it's it's just different kind of plastics like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic know that's what the different types are oh okay yeah it seems to be made out of something different yeah yeah yes i i know there's a long scientific name but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff um i like uh um-hum i don't know if if they do it all over but our Kroger does a a newspaper recycling every Saturday you can drive up and they have one of the clerks out there no the bag boys out there um that will take the papers newspaper out of your car and they'll put it in their little bin and they do the recycling i mean they collect the newspapers and their plastic the plastic grocery bags yeah which i think is pretty neat that's something since we all have seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags i know we use them for trash can liners and a lot of other things hum that's right yeah um-hum lunch bags and yeah yeah in fact i have one today it's um-hum the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom right yeah they didn't and it's like whoops there goes my chips okay fine yeah um-hum now i in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night uh no they did a program or the one of their articles was on recycling and or it was actually on a a town that has a dump that they charge other cities or towns to come in and dump their trash there they have made so much money from that that they built they bought a brand new fire engine and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough so they mought bought a new or built a new one paid for it in cash with the money that they've earned from this landfill um-hum oh they have built up one mountain they call it Mount Trashmore they built up one mountain covered it with grass and put ski lifts on it and in the winter they put snow on it and they charge to ski on it yeah so the city gets the money from that they built a golf course at the bottom and they get the money from that it's like that's it's a it's Riverview Ohio or some place up there wow um-hum but it was i thought it was a pretty neat idea they i mean their city hall looked better it was nicer than Dallas' and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city hum and they like the trash so i like well okay but i thought that was pretty neat it it would be nice if more communities could do that but you have to know from beginning and you have to have the space to do it and yeah they'll run out of space before long yeah see that's well they're already planning a second mountain so they're gonna get going to be called the Twin Peaks i was like uh-huh go back to the TV shows um-hum this it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling oh it's we i know like i said i've got a two year old and a four year old and that's my daughter thinks that anytime she sees newspapers bundled up they're being recycled so it's like well no honey so that like so that was one reason we went to show her um-hum what people did with their their stuff when they recycled it and try to explain well yeah you melt down the cans and you make them into new things and you get the paper all wet and you make it into new paper and right that's fun trying to explain that to a four year old oh so do y'all go ahead and right yeah they don't even know that paper comes from trees yet so well yeah she that was the her next question was how do you grow paper how do you grow paper was like well from trees um that's why you have to cut down trees and why you have to plant more trees um-hum and how do you grow aluminum yeah exactly um well let's see um we really don't but and then she was like well what do you do with the glass well um you crunch it up real small and then you melt it down well what if it breaks well okay it it it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her right but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing and she got our baby sitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans because that's all she talked about so i guess what um-hum  Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot really have you had lessons guitar lessons uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they weren't very good um-hum and uh so i didn't really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band yeah i was i was in several bands when i was some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little pig headed and self centered didn't care about anybody else but themselves well and bad hours too yeah yeah that too huh well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i don't play very well but uh i wouldn't say that was a hobby so much as um yeah i usually you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if it's Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so i've done some yeah yeah um crafts and things to hang up but i don't do it i don't think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment yeah um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i don't have to you know it's it's cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store um-hum so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment it's it's it's it's an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself yeah that's true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for um it really depends on what you're making uh if if you're making a piece of furniture yeah you'd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh um-hum if it's just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that um-hum hum but uh it's a it's a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you don't like go lopping your fingers off or anything sounds like it my my dad's gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and he's trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh uh-huh uh-huh he didn't get it finished because he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh he uh he doesn't know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and there's a couple of things he's done that i've like near had nearly had a heart attack over it's like Dad you're doing it wrong that's awful you're gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh that's pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so i've done some yeah and Halloween and right so i've done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest and read yeah yeah i i work i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh uh-huh i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh hum it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns aren't always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and you're supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and uh-huh yeah kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it well and there's a lot of people that enjoy sewing yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um yeah you know not so much because it's all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need yeah yeah one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy uh-huh i like that i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that it's it's a lot of fun and it's fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and um-hum and it's right and it's functional so that you're always needing you know it's nice to do your Christmas cards yeah you can do it yourself do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that yeah sounds good or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall yep that's right we have enjoyed that seems like um we've done a lot too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed snowed just um-hum  okay you ready to discuss the the topic what's the topic okay the topic is social changes and discuss social changes in America and how they relate or how they differ today than they were ten fifteen or thirty years ago okay are you ready for that okay pardon me you bet i'll let you lead out i'll let you lead out okay well uh there's uh it's kind of an interesting interesting topic and one that i think is quite fascinating because uh couple of years ago i guess uh not very not many not very long ago seemed like the whole world not just the United States but the whole world was kind of in a standstill where everyone was basically in a you know a very comfortable position so to say even though the the cold war was was in full swing you know you had the the Russians against the Americans the Communists against the Free World and in the last couple of years things have tranged dramatically not only on the political front but also on the economic front where uh couple of years ago we had uh America uh was a one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period we're also have a very humongous trade deficit and uh and that's kind of frightening also you know a couple of years ago ten fifteen fifteen ten fifteen years ago an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life and thirty years ago that was that was basically it whereas now we're expected to have a career change every you know every couple years and possibly five four to five career changes throughout our lifetime and so i think uh you know things there's been an awful lot of social change lately and a lot and uh i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes is that the they seem to be social they seem to be economically driven also um-hum um-hum so if you look at Russia and what's happened over there i think the change in Communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing i think was i look at the economic problems in the United States right now one of the things you wonder is what's that going to do to us true i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things i mean i think it's great that you can have three or four different careers in your life i think it must've been terribly boring to go through your life doing just one thing for fifty years or forty years um-hum yes yes so i think that opportunity for job change in the fact that that aspects changing true true and the uncertainty of whether you're gonna have a job is not as good but the fact that you really can make major changes in your life and jobs um-hum well do you do you think that's good or bad i think it's great you think that's great oh yeah that something yeah because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position they they're very comfortable they lose the ability to learn and the in a sense become unteachable they think they know all there is to know in their area set path and you know come in and put my time in from nine to five and when that's over with that's that's it without even giving a second thought to advancing their education or getting extracurricular um education and and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to to expand ourselves also i think one of the problems with with education in as it relates to this though is that i don't know that education education is prepared to help people make those changes it still seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession um-hum and not giving them the skills and whatever those skills are necessary to make those job changes which i think's gonna be a hard thing for for people to face yes i agree with that i agree with that so i i believe that uh an individual should really learn how to to learn yeah learn how to adapt learn how to grow in the in their college or whatever education they might take so that that's good that's good there probably needs to be some training on how to to to to adjust to these changes as they come about i mean if you look at the the high unemployment rate right now and you look at people who are in those situations i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them even ideas of how to make those changes now um-hum so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them yeah i i i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress uh for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place um-hum and it affects  okay i guess we start talking about the budget very good sir okay you you live near the nation's capital what can we do about this mess well uh living near the nation's capital unfortunately doesn't do you any good uh all i all i uh find that i can do is read the newspapers and try to decide what's best for us what we need to do and that's sort of a function of the economy and our relationship with uh other countries and so forth and right now we're in this big change since Russia has undergone such a uh big uh renegotiation within themselves yeah yeah and i'm sure that we haven't quite decided where we stand in that yet i see big opportunities in Europe opening up uh it just it just seems to me like we ought to be able to go over there and help the people become a capitalistic society yes i think they're looking for that they just need guidance yes that would be very good for us to help uh yeah show them what it what it takes to have a a capitalistic society and one in which each of them has a a say and uh you know can express their thoughts safely yeah another thing i think the uh that the President could do right now on a short term basis to get things speeded up is help out the working people right now the middle income people uh give them some tax credits i think they've done that i seems like i remember that happening once in my past i'm in my forties and i um-hum um-hum basically remember getting some sort of trax tax credit years ago and i think it helped i think we bought a car uh at that time because we got some sort of a rebate oh i don't recall ever getting a rebate but it does seem as though if if we are able to reduce the our expenditures for defense course we've got to get get this big debt that the country has under control and if as we get that under control then i'd like to see the taxes that we pay reduced a certain amount you know so that we're all comfortable but i do believe that the country's gonna have to get itself straightened out debtwise before uh they could do too much that way but i hate to see them raise the taxes if it's unnecessary well i've always believed in paying my fair share of of of taxes oh and whatever my government says is my fair share is what i think i should pay um-hum sure that makes sense uh i don't necessarily agree with people who go out of their way to find loopholes and not paying their fair share yes it it it seems as though a lot of the things that we see in the paper and in letters that you receive are showing you loopholes or how not to pay your share and that really is sort of against what the whole ball game's about isn't it yeah the lady who does my taxes for me every year it seems like she's got a new suggestion um-hum and sometimes i go with them and sometimes i don't uh since i no longer work uh usually it's not very complicated anymore but uh you no longer work i no longer work uh oh it's been almost three years ago i had some uh strange heart problems occur oh my and uh so i'm more or less hang around the house and uh that sort of thing well you have more experience at that than i i just retired from working myself on December thirty first so i haven't really had time to look at it from the retiree point of view but it'll be an interesting uh concept i'm sure yeah it's uh i know for the i thought maybe i would go back to work especially during that first year and then they finally decided that then maybe i'll never work again hm so it took some while to adjust to it and it and it took some adjusting financially and things like that i can no longer afford things that maybe i used to take for granted yes that and i certainly can't invest money like i used to i understand well it's unfortunate you had that problem and i do hope you will be able to work out your circumstances so that you can live comfortably and feel confident that you are doing your share of the taxes well and you know still there are certain things that you need to do in your family and yourself to enjoy life to its fullest what kind of work did you do when you were working i was working uh in doing research for the government so i know what it's like i had worked for the government basically i'm actually i'm a professor a retired professor at Penn State oh yeah and uh but my work has always been in research uh related uh to the government so i'm i'm aware of what it takes to perform the work that's needed and the government has got to decide what it needs to know and then set up the criteria by which problems are solved and and uh the  um i would take it that you probably read quite a bit if you picked this category okay yeah well i picked every almost every category well they said you well they said pick fifteen categories and there wasn't really all that much i was into i mean i'm interest interest of course i do read a lot but that's uh oh you'll talk about anything right but i i also picked gardening and i mean i tried to talk about that for five minutes i don't really garden very much but books i could talk about you know forever i uh me too what kind of books do you read well mostly fiction and um i i the nonfiction i like are are the usually the crime stories i see see and um we're gonna get along well well i like fiction uh matter of fact well my favorite would be horror type stories such as Stephen King and such oh you too oh see now i don't like i don't like those types i i can't relate to stuff like that it's so weird you know it's that that's why i read it because i don't have to relate to it i yeah well i like uh i i like a book i could in some way relate to and and that's i don't know it's so off the wall most of that stuff you know you really i you can't really believe it i mean you it's hard to to to read it and and really think that this could really happen it's it's i don't know it's not believable to me at all well thank goodness believe me well well that's true i mean you don't have to read a book and believe that you know stuff can happen but i don't know i guess i just go more for realism have you read The Firm oh yeah it's very good oh that was one of the best books i've read for a long time yeah yeah that was good i read that oh quite a while ago and um see another one i just read that i thought was really excellent was uh Jurassic Park oh by um oh Crichton right Crichton now now what is that about is that uh an espionage thing Michael Crichton or something like that have you read that one no it's about um this multimillionaire that has decided that he wants to start a theme park and it's about dinosaurs well they've taken DNA material from dinosaurs and and oh really recreated dinosaurs uh-huh and well it's a little far fetched also but um it was really an excellent book it held my interest have you read any of his other things yeah yeah yes i have but i Terminal Man was that was that one of his Terminal Man yeah i've seen seems like i've seen the movie he he writes stuff his writing books are similar to Robin Cook's have you read any Robin Cook i've read a couple of Robin Cook's yeah and they're sort of similar you know the in the you know he deals a lot in you know scientific stuff or you know stuff that um you don't know whether could it could happen or not you know it's just um um-hum you know but i mean most of it is good i uh haven't uh i haven't read anything by him in a long time well i noticed he had a couple i don't know how recent they are but i think Sphere was one and something else uh another one word title and i thought i might pick up one of those books because Fear is that what you said Fear Sphere S P H E R E oh oh no i don't know i'm not familiar with that no well how about did you read Silence of the Lambs oh oh yes oh yes you did you read his other one The Red Dragon yes now uh both of them were terrific yes i did they were uh Silence of the Lambs though was i i could not put the book down i well see now i couldn't either now i uh a friend of mine started to read it because you know i told her it's terrific and everybody she'd spoke to said it was terrific she couldn't get into it you're kidding well she's sort of a lightweight anyway you know her her uh her reading consists of uh have you ever heard of V C Andrews oh yes yeah you know stuff like that you know Danielle Steele you know you know stuff like that so she really she couldn't get into this but she i think she said she saw the movie she liked the movie i don't you know i see the movie was wonderful you didn't see it yeah the movie was good but i well you know compared to the book right no well true it didn't have the impact but i thought that they stayed uh they stayed very faithful to the book well they did but um i don't think it was as scary as i expected it to be i i really you know i i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as i expected it to be i don't know but it was a good it was a good movie well it's hard to top that book yeah well that's true and i'm waiting his new one comes out sometime in the spring i think oh really what's it about have you another serial killer yes uh probably another murder thing you know that's usually what he you know well this this'll be i think his fourth or fifth book and the other the previous ones were murder um the he wrote also Black Sunday which was a about the uh bombing in the in the Superdome oh it was oh and they made a movie out of that oh Two Minute Warning um gee i don't know i think it was called Black Sunday it was about fifteen well no about ten years ago i guess it uh you know you know i think you're right i think i but um i'll have to look back and see what else he's written because he that's all he's written Red Dragon that one and uh Silence of the really  family with children or uh yes in fact i'm i'm i've got grandchildren oh do you yeah so what do you find yourself spending most of your time doing with them uh spending uh oh just visiting back and forth fortunately when your children get up in their thirties they finally grow up you get to enjoy them that's true and then you just get to spoil the grandkids and send them home right that's what my mom always says right right right yeah do you have children yeah i have one little daughter she's just a year and a half oh and i think about all we ever do is just pick up after her it seems like yeah she's not too good at just sitting down and doing any one thing her attention span's only a couple of minutes i think and then its on to the new little mess oh yeah oh yeah yeah i'm sure you remember those days um but and we try and sit and read to her she's really good she'll bring us books so we read a lot of books to her and stuff but i can't they got to be just a lot of pictures and not too much else yeah or else she loses her loses a attention the attention's not that interesting to her for very long yeah i i think one of the very most important was i i guess about the most important thing that you can do for small children like that is to read to them um-hum uh and get them to love books before they ever start to preschool yeah uh uh i was very fortunate in having an older sister who read to me constantly and uh so i was i went to school in the days before public kindergarten uh uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh but uh uh i had practically all the fairy stories read to me before i started to school so uh-huh and it uh uh i made great strides and i i'm sure you'll experience the same thing yeah i i uh my mom used to spend quite a bit of time and i i've carried it through i love to read now and and uh that's why we've we've made it a point whenever she brings us a book that we don't you know we always sit down with her right then and read it so that we try and instill that on her that um-hum um-hum that uh it's something good to do but um-hum yeah it's it's kind of cute because she'll just come and she'll just start you know kind of not whining but just letting us know that it she wants us to read this book and it's the same one over and over and over again it seems like but um-hum yeah but i guess like you say she it's something so she at least she gets in the habit um-hum but yeah we uh my wife works at a day care part time and she's able to take her with her there but she she works with a lot of kids whose parents you know it's they drop them off at six in the morning and then pick them up at six at night and oh yeah um-hum um-hum then they're proud if their kids are in bed by eight you know which means they only get to spend about two hours a day with them and i just kind of wonder yeah you know there's there's a lot to be said with with parents you know for parents spending time with their kids that's for sure yeah yeah other than just you know putting them in front of the TV or something like that um i have a kind of a hard time with that but it's uh i think it's fair to say you get more of a there's a lot more love and they don't have to go elsewhere to find the the attention and stuff if the parents are spending time doing stuff with them yeah so how many children did you have do you have i have three three yeah three and how many grandchildren uh eight eight oh that's good yeah yeah we uh my mom and dad just well they have three grandchildren now each of my brother and sister each we each have one but um-hum they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death um-hum they like them but yeah uh they they're looking forward they like i say they've been looking forward to the time when they could just send them home with their with their parents as opposed to having to keep us all the time yeah yeah yeah so i i think one of the hardest things to do with children is to be consistent and and uh in your discipline cause some days when you're feeling pretty good you wouldn't mind letting them get away with murder then on days when you don't feel well um-hum yeah yeah well how do you do what do you mean you didn't do this how did you do that i mean you know as far as having to tell them no or slapping their hands or something like that that's that's what we struggle with oh oh gee i i i i did a lot of the wrong things i'm sure but uh uh that that was the hardest thing i found was to be consistent and if uh-huh i i tried to keep as few rules but well really about the only rule i had was they couldn't play on the top bunk and they had to confine their eating to the kitchen um-hum yeah those are the ones that save you a lot of time and energy so yeah yeah and uh so uh i don't know they all turned around out okay so yeah well that's the important thing and they probably appreciate all you did for them so well i i think so and um yeah we're just like i say we just all i keep hearing is from my mom is just you wait you know you'll get all that you ever gave so i could be in trouble but yeah i say they they're a handful that's for sure we i just last night uh she yeah  so what kind of hobbies you have well the primary thing that i do uh is go around and uh collect uh collectibles that are purchase collectibles and uh and some antiques uh go to a lot of garage sales and estate sales uh-huh hm and collect signatures signatures like uh like important people i guess uh yeah uh important people um oh some are just uh sports fans uh-huh uh i had i land like aviation so i've got a number of them from uh uh like the Wright brothers uh uh Chuck Yeager um Charles Lindburgh things like that hm that's pretty neat yeah most of my hobbies are uh i guess i uh i like cars i work on i like to work on my car and uh yes since i have an old car yeah oh do you what do you have i have a i have a Honda it's an eighty three Honda this car's not too bad i don't have to work on it as much but i've before this i had a Toyota Corona i don't know if you ever heard of those cars but uh yeah sure i had the car it's an eighty one Toyota Corona i must've worked on it like every third day i had it i had a i had a problem with the uh with the radiator um-hum uh the car basically would overheat i mean i i lived used to live in Washington DC and didn't have any problems when i lived up there but soon as i came down here the heat was must must've been too intense for the car so the car kept overheating and turned out it was some kind of a problem with the radiator yeah so i had the radiator replaced and they did everything they could possibly do they said there was some kind of problem they just couldn't figure out what it was and the Toyota dealer couldn't figure it out the radiator place couldn't figure it out so basically i had to keep adding water to the radiator every uh every couple days oh jeez you know and what you had to do is you had to start it up let it get hot let it suck the radiator fluid into the engine then add more water to it then shut it and then you could run another three days well that sounds like fun oh yeah let me tell you i mean it's it was bad when it was in the winter time you had to do this too you know hm yeah oh yeah so uh no as a matter of fact i've been uh seriously considering uh restoring a car uh-huh uh-huh um i was looking at a Nash Metropolitan i don't know if you know what those are no huh-uh uh they're little two tone uh cars that came out in oh is it like a mini car yeah my my parents' next door neighbor have one of those fifty really they uh it um i think his wife won it in some kind of contest and he just uh it looks almost like a fake car because it's so small it's you know and it's it's in perfect shape huh yeah yeah and uh he just kind of pulls it out every so often cleans it up puts it back in the garage does he wanna sell it yeah really but uh it's it's really a neat looking car though and uh oh yeah now i'm i've been trying to find one that's uh uh i was i was looking at getting one of those and trying to restore it yeah um-hum um-hum um that's kind of kind of cool yeah and the other hobby i have is uh i guess i play uh like the racket sports you know racquetball and tennis and i love to play that yeah oh both of them yeah um-hum because most of the folks that i found and i i used to play a lot of tennis then when i started playing racquetball uh by the time i finally got a swing down for racquetball i i found out i couldn't play tennis anymore uh-huh um-hum uh-huh well what i did was i played tennis for a long time then hadn't played for a long time then i started pay playing racquetball again uh-huh and uh when i got really good at racquetball then i waited a while and i went back to tennis and so now when i'm back to either one of the sports you know since i since the gap was so far apart between the two i think that i get back to tennis soon as i pick up a tennis racket i'm i'm back into the swing yeah oh good and soon as i pick up a racquetball racket i'm back it takes me a little while to to get as good you know uh i usually need you know at least a good hour warm-up before i'm i'm back into the swing yeah yeah but uh once i'm back in it you know it's pretty good well it's tough to those ceiling shots on a tennis court oh yeah that's definite yeah you don't it i have to really think about the uh the ceiling shots and the side wall shots you know yeah uh and that's probably it probably puts more pressure on my brain than it does in my on my body i tell you i really like uh racquetball it's a great sport see it's aerobic and uh and if you play with someone uh you got to play with someone who's as good as you are you know not better or not and not worse yeah yeah yeah because if you play i used to play with uh my roommate and uh from college and we uh we were both about the same as far as you know how good we both were you know and we'd have volleys that would last five or six minutes you know yeah and uh it does i mean we weren't like the best players in the world but we you know we we couldn't get it past each other you know um-hum and uh i used to work out to play racquetball three or four times a week and i tell you by the end of the summer i was in perfect shape you know yeah so it's it's a great sport great aerobic sport i like it better than uh tennis just because i don't have to go so far to get the ball well the only reason i like it better than tennis is i used to play tennis with my dad and he plays uh old man tennis you know he could hit puts underspin on the ball all the time and he can hit every ball okay but he doesn't hit it hard he just hits it really lightly you know makes you run all over the place yeah uh-huh so who and it just kind of drives me up the wall  well Nancy what do you think um some of the changes in roles of women are in American society in the past generation or two well of course working um-hum that's definitely got to be the biggest thing is that everybody's out there working uh-huh including me well what do you think it is um-hum um yeah i agree i also think that there are more um the people are women stay single longer it seems like yeah yes they do yeah they do yeah i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty and i waited until i was thirty two so right uh-huh yeah you know um i know that yeah that's true it's a big change i'm an OB nurse and so i really do see what you're saying there uh-huh it used to be that our list ran nineteen twenty twenty one for our patients' ages and now our care plans look more like thirty two thirty three if we get somebody twenty one we go oh look how young so yeah you're right there's a big change and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties uh-huh yeah uh-huh so that's true but again i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers yeah um-hum if they didn't have if they weren't out there working and having their careers they probably would be married and having their children so i guess it's a combination yeah yeah yeah seems like there uh-huh go ahead no go on oh it just seems like there are more single mothers too i mean that's there're a lot of yeah either divorced or um you know never been married so yeah yeah yeah there's a lot of mixed up families that's for sure yeah yeah i agree well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so well just that i think the families the the role in the family and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner take care of the children um-hum um we do it all i really think that and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers but i still think the mothers yeah have the major role i really do i think they're just um-hum they're not doing very much less i don't think as far as the kids and and the house and everything are concerned not from what i see and and they're contributing to the income besides yeah yeah uh-huh i think that we're really really putting a lot of stress on ourselves um-hum yeah and it really it's affecting the families you know for mothers not not to be home and yet you know um oh it is i mean i i don't blame anybody when they have to work because um yeah yeah yeah it's it's difficult and i think that i live in Plano actually so um-hum it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better um-hum and i really hate that you know i hate to see that and and i've been here for a very long time um-hum um-hum but um i don't know now i'm a single parent and i don't have a choice anymore but um-hum i used to just work occasionally for extra money but now i have to work all the time and that's really hard and and i don't know how a mother does just choose to go out to work and um-hum yeah and leave the kids in a way it's good it's very good to get out with adults and i think that's a good thing if you can do it part time but to just go out there forty hours a week at least and um-hum yeah and work and and leave your kids to get home from school alone and that kind of thing i think that's not very smart i think that's difficult on them so um-hum yeah well what do you think's gonna happen in the next generation you think it'll continue yeah well it's gonna be interesting i yeah i think it will change but i'm not sure how it's going to because i see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and and to raise a family i don't know how they're gonna do it um-hum um-hum and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again i don't think that ever will go backwards um-hum but i don't know what effect it's gonna have on these kids now when they grow up how they're gonna feel about it um-hum it you know it could lead to another Woodstock type thing you know where where there's just too much material things and and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things yeah um-hum and they might wanna do without things rather than do that to their families it's hard to say yeah um-hum yeah it is i think some i don't know how many you know what percentage but some are will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children i guess i see that happening already uh-huh some choosing it and and they get you know there're people chide them for it you know why aren't you out  well you got a topic well you know there's uh the uh the the the one that's burning in everybody's uh in everybody's mind the uh break up of the Soviet Union and it's a yeah i think i i think that's the obvious one in't it ah it's it's it's effects here at home i mean it's gonna have effects all over the world and uh course you know i i expect uh in the next few days when uh the president gives his uh State of the Union address he's got to have to uh pull some uh real drastic changes in what he's doing to to promote some some movement and enthusiasm behind his reelection race yeah well it it's truly amazing to um see how rapidly um uh the Soviet Union fell apart um uh yeah and it makes me wonder i'm not saying that i'm uh i'm certainly not a hawk necessarily but it makes me wonder i've thought about this if the idea of uh uh the the arms race while granted it has practically practically bankrupted this country uh perhaps it did bankrupt uh Russia and was you know as a as a way of making a a a political change was certainly preferable to a war yeah well they they they focused all of their economic capacity on on on their military right i mean if they had focused the same capacity in their uh commercial stuff they would've been a lot better off as a society probably uh yeah with the right kind of the Japanese for example yes like the Japanese right yeah well and i don't know what we've we've seen so many changes just in the past five years uh it makes me think it reminds me of that book uh Future Shock um-hum where the the future is coming at us uh at such an accelerated pace day after day that only the most adaptable are gonna be able to uh survive and and keep from just being overrun by the changes well uh you know five five years ago could you have have imagined in your in your your wildest dreams that something as as a change as rapid as this would've occurred oh no no it's just you know it it's almost unthinkable but it it is hey in a i i still wonder whether you know that it's going to be stable and then what's going to happen there it really is well and that's just it i i have some i have doubts that uh that it can be ah stable number one you've got uh you know you see on the news the the stories the stories and the and the sights of these these the Soviet people these Russian people that are standing in line uh for hours on end and have for you know bare shelves at in these hugely you know uh higher prices that they have to pay now that that government controls are off but i don't think the shelves is bare anymore oh are they are they back are they have they got some um i think there's now you know i think all the time there were goods to to be distributed that were being held off but they're on the black market yeah and uh you know i i i think that uh there's still but but you know the the people don't have a lot of money to pay for them there there's a tremendous uh gap in their ability to to supply themselves uh uh that could create a tremendous amount of political stability instability in fact they said tonight on the on the radio uh that yeah uh some some leader in in in of of the parliament in in Russia is calling for Yeltsin to essentially throw out all of his ministers and replace them hm because of this this tremendous supply demand uh type gap that they have there yeah uh i don't know it it's it's it's hard to imagine managing such a rapid change yeah and i don't i don't that's just it it's funny it's inconceivable inconceivable to me to think that anyone or any entity i don't care what it is could actually manage i mean it would it's kind of like damage control and maybe putting out the biggest fires but i don't think that it's really a manageable uh of set of circumstances well and and i think that you know we we stand uh in in in the possibility of of in of of being confronted with a similar kind of thing here uh everybody is is calling for you know this this this this uh peace dividend and it the with with an election year coming up there's the uh that there's the the the possibility of everybody proposing something radical to to appeal to the voters to to to get elected but you know how how rapidly can they change and how rapid can they move well as far as i'm concerned i can change pretty doggone rapidly and i'm all for something radical because i think it's gonna take something radical to turn this country around um  all right um serious problems in the public education and what can be done about it um well what do you think well i that's funny because i just um quit my job to stay home with my kids and um i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools oh so i know a little bit about it not a whole great deal well tell me about it what are what are the problems with public education well um there there's some there's several it's such a a broad you know topic that you you you need to boil it down but um one that um uh-huh i thought was a problem that it's a it i thought it was a serious problem that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now uh was like bilingual education uh-huh for um different um minority groups and like Asians and um uh Mexican Americans and and just people in general that speak other languages that sometimes come from other countries or coming from different areas and they and in this area and um as the school district i'm not sure how to go about it because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these language and so most of these children are put in um either special ed or a bilingual program right and then for just a small amount of time and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining of the part of the day and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak English um-hum and so um a lot of the moneys isn't put into that and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner and um you know it there's only so long you can do that and to me that seemed like a big problem in the school districts and a lot of the teachers right it not it was not the teacher's fault a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children do you find that those parents um yeah i've seen the same thing and heard the same things and at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend you know that that time you know typically the mother was at home with uh the children and and at least could kind of keep up on what's going on and really society sort of dictates that uh yeah yeah you know both the parents work and and um yeah i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the you know the second and third grade uh if the kids had you know proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that that would make a lot of difference oh yeah oh definitely definitely and it and it teaches language too which is really good um yeah well i work at a university and and it's really tough when we're uh uh i i uh work at the University of Texas at Dallas and uh-huh uh we have uh some pretty selective admissions requirements for incoming freshmen uh-huh and you know there are some students who are in the top ten percent of their class even some who are maybe you know in the top ten uh of their class and their S A T scores are very low and a lot of it has has to do with their uh their reading ability you know their their language and yeah oh definitely yeah it uh makes it tough because when when you know when they come in with scores that low they may be uh good students but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential and they're gonna fail unless some sort of remedial uh education is given to them so right right and then it then it comes into well who's supposed to give it to them the colleges and universities or are they supposed to get that back in the high schools and the junior highs well i know Richardson school district has a has a wonderful program in the remedial reading um where you know of course all the children are tested in some time at portion of the year and and uh some children who need extra help are put into this um reading program and it is just excellent it is i wish that yep all the children could be exposed to that program you know and then there i know that there are some parents that say how do i get my kids in that and yet they don't qualify but unfortunate that they don't qualify because i think everybody would benefit from these programs yeah it sounds like it it is excellent so so how many children do you have at home i have two little ones and that's why i i quit my job uh you know i've been teaching since they were gosh newborns and and it just wasn't adding up and you know oh being a teacher and you see all these parents who are working and working and working and just you know don't have the time time time time it was kind of getting to me where well i'm doing the same thing yeah and so um you know my children are getting older and i was missing out on a lot so i just decided to stay home for a while i don't know how long as long well that's good what when  okay um what kind of hobbies do you have Lori um i guess uh i like to play golf uh-huh and um i also like to plant flowers and do do some gardening and do arts and crafts uh-huh where do you play golf or in this area well we live uh pretty close to the Mesquite Golf Course uh-huh so we'll play either out there or at Firewheel that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the Dallas area do you uh do you ride or do you pull a cart when you play golf uh both not at the same time i was gonna say that could be difficult now sometimes we ride and sometimes um we pull we like to to a lot of times just walk for the exercise uh-huh but i find that when i ride in a cart i play better and i think it's because i don't get as tired i think that might be true yeah i don't like pulling a cart on Firewheel golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path i know and that makes me so mad i you know it's like it's not gonna do that much damage to the course but apparently they think differently that's the reason i don't play over there yeah i like the course but i don't play over there because you they don't uh you know don't allow you to pull a cart right and i don't think a cart damages the turf right well the reason why we play over there is because since we're a Garland resident they give us a special deal where you can get um ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollar yeah a hundred dollars because it's half price what the normal green fees are uh-huh so that's why we you know play over there because we've got our card well i guess i could use a car too i live uh very near very close to the Firewheel Golf Course oh do you so you live in Garland then yes i live in northwest Garland right up there near the golf course okay well we're in south Garland but yeah next time you go um you know check into it they've uh it's just like uh a bus card and they just punch it you know it's got one through ten on it and every time you go they just punch it for you well in the last two years i haven't played very much golf because i'm involved in Boy Scouts oh okay so i have uh i have children i have children Boy Scout age i have two boys that are Boy Scout age and so you must have a a son oh okay i'm very active in Boy Scouts so i'd have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and Boy Scouts is my hobby yeah oh well that sounds like fun too but i like but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again because my boys are still right at the beginning age and it's gonna probably be six to eight years before they go to college uh-huh well you need to teach them how to play take them out on the course with you so that's right lessons are expensive though oh yeah well you can teach them well they probably would never make it then because i don't think i only took lessons for golf when i was in college uh-huh ah as a course for P E you know so i could graduate right right uh-huh but uh that's the only time i think i've ever really taken golf lessons and that was kind of a group scenario and not individual uh-huh right right i took one lesson one other time besides that um i just uh try to make the club hit the ball right yeah i know what you mean i don't wanna play strike out you know uh-huh but i have fun doing it some you know have some good shots and some bad shots oh yeah it's it's just nice to get outdoors and do something so you said you work uh in the gardens too do you have ah special flowers well flower gardens i like to have matter fact this past weekend i i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs so those ought to be coming up around spring time my wife had uh just put in a bunch of i wanna say they're pansies uh-huh she put them in like two months ago because they're winter plants right and they just bloom with all even with all the cold weather weather we've had they've been blooming just fine oh they do great i put mine in probably in November that's when she did i think yeah i think was November and i don't do anything to mine i don't water mine or anything and they just they do really good and i even had i guess it was last year the year before i had some out and it froze and the pansies looked terrible but they came back later i didn't do anything to them so they're um they're they're good to plant in the winter time because they last for a long time then so if you start putting them you know you can put them out in the spring too but once it starts getting real hot then it just kills them because they can't stand the hot weather um-hum do they survive longer if you put them in the winter time will they make it through the summer some no they won't make it through the summer because it gets too hot but they'd make it through probably winter and spring um-hum so yeah i've got some of those too i love flowers well oh that's good yeah and i do some i try to do some arts and crafts and i love to go the to  well what kind of music do you like well seeing as how i'm a musician i like all kinds of music um-hum yeah we all very very kinds um-hum me too i mostly like classical and jazz uh-huh well i like everything from hard core country to you know Wagner and Mahler and i like new age stuff i i basically have a wide range of musical likes um-hum do you um are you musical uh are you a musician at all yeah i play the trumpet uh-huh do you most of the trumpet music's um um Baroque and um um um Romantic Baroque and Romantic jazz uh-huh yeah that's not there there's um things written for Doc Severinsen and a few other people but uh they're just uh as far as solos and concertos are concerned but the rest of them are just parts right and all um well i love Baroque music so it's one of my favorite periods um-hum and and in fact i i sing with the Texas Baroque ensemble um-hum who are the trumpet players in that well we used to have um Ralph Dutchen but now he's in Massachusetts he's come back a couple of times then there's a trumpet player at North Texas the the teacher the main teacher uh-huh Leonard Candelaria yeah yeah and he's played and the two of them have played natural trumpets and occasionally when she can't get those people we'll use you know just uh E flat trumpets uh-huh um-hum with valves and like Glen Bell plays and yeah uh Rick um Bogart's played too so uh-huh but actually i like i like trumpet and organ together um-hum it's a nice combination yeah Richard Jung Julio recorded an album at Saint Thomas Aquinas didn't he yeah yeah i think he did with Paul yeah he's wonderful both of them are so do you like Romantic music well that's what that's mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are Romantic music Mahler and Ruckner and and Strauss um-hum do you like opera uh i like i'm liking it more and more now uh-huh getting used to it there's a and mostly uh mostly Mozart uh-huh i mean there's not there's not any kind of trumpet parts but uh you know the i just like the melodies more and and and uh the libretto uh-huh you don't like Puccini um yeah well i like Rossini better than Puccini uh-huh i like more comic than uh-huh are you going to go see The Elixir of Love no do you ever go to the Dallas Opera uh no i've never been to the Dallas Opera only the Fort Worth Opera uh-huh and my trumpet teacher used to uh play in the Fort Worth Opera who was your trumpet teacher uh John Nelson uh-huh i know him i kind of know him is he still around here uh-huh yeah he played in the Fort Worth Symphony in Fort Worth mostly because i don't i've not seen him playing anywhere lately but maybe it's because he's playing in Fort Worth yeah well i'm basically a church musician i do a church in Plano and we do all kinds of music at my church and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for different things yeah uh um-hum so i'm always making music of one kind or another which Church is it uh it's at Christ United Methodist Church in Plano uh uh-huh it seems like a lot of churches are hiring more musicians now than they used to yeah most churches have the well there's some of the few organizations that have the funds to you know to do like big big works um-hum uh but we hire you know we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on throughout the year that we have you know John Cuminado yes he plays at our church a lot uh-huh in fact he is playing this Sunday at our church but he's still teaching at Brookhaven isn't he but he plays pretty regularly uh i think so he teaches a lot in Plano at high schools but i think he teaches at Brookhaven oh yeah yeah because i heard Glen Bell taught at Plano as well yeah Glen teaches here too they're the two of them are mainly pretty much the i think they've cornered the market on trumpet students uh-huh  so national health care i don't know about you but for me i am voting for the next democrat for the president that says he is going to do something about a national health care program yeah i uh i basically agree uh i have mixed feelings i guess there are some uh somehow there needs to be some controls on the rising costs of of health care yeah yeah i myself uh i haven't worked for three years because of some medical problems and uh if i had not had insurance with the company i worked with at the time i believe i would have died and that worries me thinking cause i know a lot of people that don't have any coverage at all yeah yeah if you if you don't have a very good paying job or you are not with a company that provides it it is uh pretty much unaffordable uh to pay for it on your own yeah well i i think that paying for it on your own it is like in my case i am up to about two hundred thousand dollars worth of health care i don't think that would have been possible for the majority of the people in this world yeah that is right so but then again there is uh the high cost of medical care is out unreal yeah i have a friend who uh uh is from uh lived at lived in London or lived in London and he lives here now where they do have medical uh health care uh there and i guess i guess there is some disadvantages too i guess uh uh because of that they there has been a great uh migration of of doctors from there over to more lucrative practices and sometimes i guess it does effect the quality of health care somewhat so uh-huh well i think somewhere along the line whatever plan they come up with it is going to have to keep the doctors in a high paying field i yeah uh i myself have a son who hopes to be a doctor in a couple three more years and uh he is doing it for the money yeah yeah they don't have i think they don't get into it for any other reason so yeah um but he agrees with me though that there should be something worked out for the people that can't afford it yes uh i uh agree too and also the uh the elderly a lot of times when they uh reach retirement uh they can't afford any any supplemental insurance beyond what is provided through Medicare and Medicaid and sometimes that is not enough to to cover the costs right yeah i found out yeah i uh my mother is on Medicare Medicaid whatever and uh i know it doesn't pay all of her medical hospital bills and so forth yeah and i think it is kind of a shame that at this point in her life she still has to pay quite a bit whenever she is in the hospital several thousand for a weeks stay if she ends up having to pay yeah yeah particularly for people who are on uh on on just living mostly on social security or something like that they don't have enough extra money to pay for that uh-huh i know one uh not this Christmas but the Christmas before she was out here and we were out at Smithville which is a little town out east of here and we had to take her to the hospital on a Sunday afternoon for a back problem uh fairly minor she just strained it sprained it but when the bills starting coming in she had already gone home so i got a chance to look at them and i was shocked i mean i have been through a lot yeah i mean with medical bills but when i saw what they did to her that day and it cost about three thousand dollars just to uh get a prescription for some pain pills basically yeah yeah uh in i guess in addition to uh uh national health care policy there uh there has to be some sort of monitoring i guess too of the overall medical field and hospital costs and and yeah uh well that doesn't happen i it is weird i was in the hospital for like eight days back in October uh so many mistakes were made during my time there that i uh literally left the hospital in a taxi cab just to get away from the place i was scared as to what they were going to do to me next yeah yeah and when i got the bill it was outrageous uh pills that i had never heard of that i had taken which i know that i didn't i mean i wasn't ill i was just in for some routine stuff and it goes on and on yeah yeah i am afraid right now there is a lot of i guess you would have to call it just basic fraud in the in in the business cause they know they can turn a lot of these things in and they are not questioned at all yeah right uh i don't know which one of the uh democratic candidates either either Kerrey or Clinton i guess one of those two i can't remember which is pretty much in favor of some sort of i think Kerrey is and i think also Jerry Brown from California are interested uh actually the way Bush has been going the last few weeks i think he may be interested uh he he seem to be yeah well he's he's probably campaigning i don't know how serious he is but yeah uh yeah up until just recently i i would have thought Bush would uh you know i still he has done a pretty good job  have you gone to college yourself yeah i have did you where'd you go i went to Western State College in Gunnison Colorado oh yeah what about you uh i went i graduated from ah Weaver State University here at in Ogden oh okay yeah so what did you uh or what would you recommend for a good college i guess i personally would recommend the smaller college just because uh-huh you know you get a lot more individual attention and and you can go speak talk to your professor and um-hum and uh it's just more i think it's more conducive to studying especially if you're like a freshman yeah i agree with you a hundred percent i Weaver's a pretty small college we have uh about ten thousand to twelve thousand students and i i have some friends who went to Brigham Young University and the the University of Utah that you know they got twenty five thirty thousand people and um-hum you know all they are is a number you go to a testing center for everything and you just check in by number or you most all most of the time they said they actually even had uh uh student or not student teacher but you know graduate students teaching their classes right whereas you know all my professors i knew they were PhD's or whatever and that they were tenured and everything and felt like uh like like you say i got a lot more personal attention and right is that uh is that in the mountains uh yeah we are oh great yeah well that's the way that's what Western State was too oh yeah it's beautiful i i'd yeah i wouldn't trade it i wish i could move back yeah yeah i'm tired of the big city that's for sure yeah are you are you close to Dallas or yeah we're just uh uh out skirts of Dallas yeah uh we uh in fact my campus was right on uh the benches of the mountains so i was it was really pretty all the time yeah sure enjoy i i don't know if i could ever move away did you ski of course yeah you i i haven't uh actually the last couple of years i haven't been able to as much because uh out of school but uh i i did a lot when i was in high school and stuff when i didn't have to spend the time studying and working and supporting a family but right i love it you yourself oh yeah definitely yeah you don't get as much of a chance down there in Texas do you i would think no i regret it too i i really wanna yeah i'd like to go this year we were supposed to go on a ski trip but that's one that's one thing i would recommend too because you know go up to Colorado or yeah most college you go to a college and you make what you what you uh what you can out of it you know uh-huh and when you get out then you know you're you basically promote yourself and you try and network into a company or or get a job or start a business or whatever yeah um-hum but uh you just can't trade the the the time you know that you spend in the mountains you know if you if you fish and hunt or whatever and ski yeah that's true um-hum you know i i'd never give up that oh yeah they offer i mean anymore they offer cook there's a you know we have uh we had a mountain climbing class we had you know we had a ski class yeah and there was all kind of that stuff that was offered as you know electives and those were i mean those were the funniest ones i mean right sure that made up for all the English classes or you know the science classes you had to take but uh right yeah that was what made it like i say made it worthwhile and at least kept you going to school on a semi regular basis i know it was pretty tough come spring or in summer or especially when it was so cold man if you didn't have a reason like a ski class you never went right yeah it just wasn't worth it so but yeah i uh i'm convinced that after getting me my undergraduate degree i would like to go to a big name school to get my graduate degree but they're so expensive i'm not anymore i i almost think people just require they require a graduate degree or an undergraduate degree they don't necessarily care where from and if you wanna set yourself apart you have to go get that big graduate degree from Harvard or some place like that yeah they do that's right or else it you know you're just Joe Blow off the street nobody knows but right what'd you get your degree in uh business administration oh did you did you have an emphasis in anything or yeah emphasis in finance oh did you that's what i got mine in was in finance yeah so where you're working at now yeah really i'm at uh company by the name of E Systems we're a defense contractor down here uh-huh uh-huh it's it's pretty good company so oh really are you an analyst for them or yeah i'm a scheduling analyst yeah oh really great so yeah i'm a little out of my field of what i wanna be i'm an auditor for a credit union but oh really it's not something i wanna do for very long is there a lot of we're kind of the bad guys it's kind of a negative type thing but a lot of companies up there or uh not not a lot of private ah there i mean there's a lot of companies but they're not really large enough they're mainly there's a lot of family type companies and just small ten fifteen people uh-huh we uh pretty much are you know the government plays a big part in our economy and for what reason how do they do that well we got we have uh  yeah okay so you enjoy camping oh yeah i uh like like you i haven't done it in quite some time yeah uh-huh uh-huh except for what i call living now which is which is very close to camping yeah you know i i camped in the Boy Scouts and uh yeah is it uh-huh you know my dad and i went out sometimes but uh even my first uh eight or nine years of working i camped almost all the time because i was in construction um-hum uh-huh and it's cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress i mean you when you have to have it you got to have it yeah um-hum and you know in uh in those those kinds of situations uh you know room rent was just outrageous um-hum so my buddy and i we just camped and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it yeah uh-huh uh-huh course we didn't really rough it that much when when i was in in high school uh he's a couple of years older than me and uh he graduated and went off to college and and during during summer we'd camp out at the lake um-hum but it was wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove and you know i had a little uh boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine oh well yeah um-hum and uh well it was fantastic we'd get up in the morning go skiing at that substituted for a shower you know and then we'd go to work and uh come back to the you know to the boat house at night um-hum you know in in the afternoon you know it's still four o'clock you got four hours of day light good skiing left um-hum and uh it was great yeah but uh you know now my life is more like camping than not camping really um-hum do you have electricity out there yeah you've got a phone obviously oh yeah well actually as a matter of fact they just ran the phone three years ago we didn't have a phone um-hum uh-huh and they didn't have phone lines i mean there was you just couldn't get a phone yeah and uh we're on the we're third from the end on the electric string uh-huh so uh and we're at the end of the mail route like i said we are probably as far as you can get from a Seven Eleven and still be in Texas yeah yeah i guess so huh but uh you know right now uh what we did my wife and i is we got a a mobile home um-hum one of these twelve by forty eight's that got repaid um-hum and uh i swapped them a Cadillac for it and i put it out here on the land figuring i'd build a house some day you know i'm in construction and uh uh-huh you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here you know putting up fence and building driveway and drilling well and all that stuff that you have to do before you can even put a house in you know um-hum and uh i came home from work one Friday afternoon and our truck was packed everything we had was in boxes and my wife said uh we're moving um and i said where she said out to the trailer and i said oh no she said yep i said okay so we've been uh roughing it out here about three years but it's not bad i we got color TV and microwave i mean you know it's not horrible but it's it's a lot like camping um-hum uh-huh yeah well i grew up in California in southern uh central California right in the valley so it's forty five minute drive to the mountains and uh-huh uh-huh um so my dad loved fishing and camping so we'd go up first we went up just uh with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our um hot dogs by the fire or whatever sure but then later my mom and dad got a camper so uh we've kind of moved up yeah a little bit in the world became civilized yep my mom goes camping you know she she takes her uh motor home you know she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air conditioning color TV microwave oven you know she just roughing it for me is you know going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower you know yeah yeah and but you know she has a lot of fun um-hum and mostly it's just a way to she she goes to dog shows see she shows dogs and uh you can sneak a dog into a motel but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel um-hum um-hum no and so she you know takes the motor home and she made a deal with my dad that she'd take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing and she but if he'd buy her a motor home so he did um-hum yeah but as far as as camping my wife and i had plans to uh not really camp per se but to drive up the you know Highway One there in in California um-hum uh as soon as we get this house finished i'm gonna need a vacation yeah oh that's a that'll be pretty that's really pretty out there so a lot of nice places  are you Bob i am in Plano where are you oh okay i am in Waco is that right oh okay yeah right down the street oh credit cards my favorite subject you mean you use credit cards oh do i uh i bet you used them all up over Christmas yeah mostly over Christmas uh i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off and then your are in debt and so then you have no money so you use a credit card i understand that so yeah uh i probably have one of every credit card there is do you use them a lot well uh it kind of comes and goes uh i use uh Citibank uh the Advantage one pretty much because you get uh-huh Advantage points for every dollar you spend and once a year i get a free airplane ride that way oh so as long as you pay it off every month it doesn't cost you anything yeah yeah well that is a good idea so that is what i that through a Visa yeah uh-huh yeah huh but uh i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use but uh uh-huh if i can get away with paying them off every month it is alright if i don't then it gets expensive yeah yeah that is my problem i don't try and pay them off i pay like the minimum but i know so i have got myself well you shouldn't do that you you you never you you you never get out of the hole that way exactly i have got that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now but i pay most of them on time and everything it is just the i always have them so it is kind of strange kind of like the federal government right oh yeah exactly like the government in never never get out of debt in debt for and any time you try to get out of debt the economy goes to pot because people are spending money right yeah yeah have they put the cap on the interest rates so no i didn't know if they actually did that or not i know they were i know they were considering it no just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent the rest of the uh and me we got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent so uh-huh yeah funny how that works isn't it thou thou who doesn't need credit gets cheap credit i would be interested to find out how many people or how much uh people use credit this year say in nineteen ninety two as opposed to nineteen ninety one even nineteen ninety i think i think it be amazing how much how many more people use it well i think so because the because of the economy yeah that's right right you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at exactly yeah i would be very i would like to see some numbers on that i think that would be interesting do you do you have any uh credit union or anything where you work or anything like that do you yeah i have a credit union we have a Master Card or Visa too yeah they do uh-huh you got that one yes i do yes i do a matter of fact who who do you work for uh i work for Channel six oh it's it's an NBC affiliate down here yeah i do a lot of work down in Waco a lot of i call on a lot of my business is down there oh really oh okay where do you work what is your yeah i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh oh okay Tyme and Mercury and Tempco and all those people down there oh okay so you probably work with uh GNK uh what is the boy from here you ever work with Davis Davis Iron yes yep matter of fact i just saw them last week yep Davis Iron Work yeah oh okay and uh what else are are you in that part are you in the south part of town now yeah well i live actually in Hewett oh yeah okay yeah right outside so that is where Davis Iron Works is you know you know uh Parker Machine Tool down there uh Bobby Parker i don't think i have seen that one i am sure i pass by it or something but i am not sure there is a place in Hewett called it is a new company called Prime Air that is in Hewett just around the corner from Davis Iron Works huh Prime Air yeah they make uh humidifiers and uh filters for air filtration stuff for you know hospitals homes something like that it's a new kind oh okay okay have you ever been to Marlin uh yeah i think it is Marlin or Mart they have uh uh a place i guess that would be similar to Prime Air it is called H G H or something like K G H or oh really huh i can't think of i can't think of the name but i will have to stop in there i went i have gone through there uh my oldest son goes to A&M and uh-huh oh yeah he is working on his Master's the Navy sent him there for his Master's mostly in Engineering so once and a while we go up six there rather than take forty five uh-huh uh-huh yeah that is about the last time i have been through Marlin and Mart uh-huh oh i don't like that drive i make that drive sometimes we have stories out there but there is always a state trooper down there you have got to drive careful huh oh really i know between Mart and Marlin they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour oh goodness they they are bad at Hewett too on eighty four they are real bad that is where i got my last ticket huh uh-huh so of course i couldn't pay that on a credit  my name is Ferrell are you ready where are you calling from i'm calling from Miami Miami i'm in Utah Utah well we've got a long distance connection tonight yeah yes it is definitely you ready to start i am sure go ahead well you know the first thing i thought about whenever uh i don't have children but i um have a friend who's a school teacher and uh uh-huh she has told me some horror stories but uh other than that i was thinking about um the the fact that uh so many uh kids nowadays can't even identify on the map on a globe where they are uh-huh and it's just astounding to me yeah um i uh have a little bit of a background well my wife taught school for about six years and uh i'm almost convinced there's a lot of it has to do with environment uh she taught in a poor area poor area here in Utah and they recently did a big article in the local paper about the S A T scores in all the districts of the state yeah and uh the district we're presently living in had like double the scores where she taught and it wasn't because she was a bad teacher or the teachers there were bad i think a lot of it has to do with the environment and the help the kids get from from home yeah and i think you're right i think an awful lot of it has to do with uh the kind of emphasis that uh the children get uh at home on education because um uh this friend of mine who's a school teacher was telling me she said uh you know uh that she has uh uh kids that uh are are Indian and Pakistani uh Oriental you know some of them who uh have only been uh in the United States maybe for two generations uh-huh yeah uh-huh that uh she said their English is excellent uh their their social social skills are good and uh you know why is it that uh that they can be such model citizens and uh yet uh-huh you know other young kids uh uh kids who have you know been uh born and uh bred here in the US uh just don't seem to get it uh-huh yeah well you know you see these documentaries on uh on Japan for example and the uh rigors they put their students through i mean their high school students are going six days a week right uh to get into college is uh no small feat there i mean just to be accepted i'm sure there are other countries that put a little more pressure on their on their children than than we do yeah i'm beginning to wonder if maybe um year round school would not be a bad uh a bad thing now we have that to a to a degree here that's only because we have a little bit of a of a problem that's i guess peculiar to Utah and we have a a high population of young young people young children one of the larger uh uh student teacher ratios you know average class size is probably thirty five or something like that yeah and that poses another problem where the you know just the individual attention that's needed sometimes uh is lacking because of the you know the shear numbers of it and what they've gone to is a year round program here where uh in essence they have what they call tracks and you know the kids go year round but you have uh you go like for uh eleven weeks and you're off for two or three then you go eleven weeks and so you have these these four periods rather than than the classic summer vacation yeah these are just mostly the elementary grades however yeah well i don't know i uh i uh i don't certainly don't have the answer to it i know that uh um in Houston uh for example where i'm i have some friends who uh uh uh-huh were telling me that they have the option there of selecting the school that uh uh they want their kids to go to oh and uh regardless of where they live huh yeah right and uh the idea of running a a school oh sort of like a business in a way such that if enough people are interested in sending their children there it it gets more funding and those schools that are less successful uh uh uh less successful get less money uh oh that's that's interesting it's kind of like uh turning it over to the private sector to some degree yeah the and the the supply and demand works yeah uh-huh uh-huh that's an interesting concept but i don't know if that's the answer but i do think that there needs to be some changes made somewhere along the way yeah yeah i i the stories you read about the competency and the literacy of the high school graduates for example oh it's a nightmare i can't believe it you well and the very idea that anyone could graduate from high school and not and not know how to read or write it's scary uh-huh it's scary yeah their their awareness of the of the uh current events and geography like you were mentioned early uh-huh  do you know about the space program well actually at this point my understanding of the space program is a little on the limited side um i think they keep it that way purposely yeah well that's to an extent that's understandable yeah it's gonna take uh i think it's gonna take a long time before they uh get that space colony out there yeah they uh i remember uh six five six years ago they showed on uh one of the scientific channels you know not Discovery but one of those old ones um-hum yeah they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages yeah and it's supposed to be about ten miles long oh it's supposed to be more of a colony than a than a research lab right right well they they were all gonna be research scientists out there and they were just gonna build it up and make it bigger and bigger yeah and but the initial stage was supposed to be about ten miles long which is i mean huge for i guess for space yeah like a central unit and then everything else kind of rotating out from that um no it was more like one big long thing it wasn't uh anything circular i've seen a circular pattern too uh but i don't know if uh you know how far along they went with the circular pattern yeah yeah but uh like i say this was a long time ago and uh they this is one big long one that they had planned on and they had thought out how they were gonna uh regenerate the air with plants and stuff and they had a oh okay they they had thought that out or hadn't no they had they had thought out they had thought it out only the only thing was it was really really expensive and it was yeah not if you got to think about it was five or six years they said you know by nineteen ninety seven or nineteen ninety eight we would actually be able to uh to start launching this thing yeah and they'd have to take several projects to go up there before and add on piece by piece yeah so it was all modular like you send up a small section it'd be liveable for a couple of people and they send up another section and bolt it on and um-hum um-hum right and then they've and once it got big enough they would send more people up once it got established and they got all the systems working yeah yeah well that sort of thing could work um yeah pretty fascinating what did they did did was there any indication what they're going do about uh gravity no it was pretty it was no it was a it was a gravity free environment they uh they had shown they had shown like at some sort of uh simulation on how it would be up there and they showed people floating around so uh or were they just gonna let you bob around hm yeah at at the point i don't think there was any kind of uh you know gravity control whatsoever now what what they've started figuring out lately is that gravity or some form of it makes it a whole lot easier to stay up there for long periods uh-huh hm some of the uh i i've heard little bits of stuff about some of their things they found out about that was was it one and a half year stay some Soviet cosmonauts spent up in space uh-huh um-hum and they had some problems digestive tract problems and uh uh minor circulatory uh little problems but they could eventually become pretty big problems or if people people with with problems to start with that weren't really noticed yet hm yeah i can see that oh um-hum they they could generate into big problems um hm no uh these these people definitely didn't look into any kind of stuff like that they were just talking about the space station itself and how were they gonna put it up there and spend all this money they uh yeah that's why a lot of the um designs for space stations have been circular um-hum um-hum so they can get them spinning centrifugal force comes close enough to uh uh simulating gravity that there's very little problem with uh uh gravityless uh side effects uh-huh hm you know i don't know if you saw it was it two thousand and one that uh that double wheel arrangement uh-huh yeah uh-huh right right right that's uh one of the more popular theories hm they also have them where you got a long central cylinder kind of like a like a cross connection tube and a lot of pods sticking out from that central core kind of like a big pine cone like deal um-hum um-hum um-hum hm or a bottle brush almost where the pods are all rotating in enough of a a hm hm a rotation speed so that the centrifugal force pretty much is one uh is is equal to earth gravity uh-huh uh-huh so that's pretty neat hm then i would i'd mean it makes sense you know i never had thought about it you ever see the uh the EPCOT Center no no i've not the uh at the EPCOT Center in in uh i think it's the the AT and T display they show a a bunch of uh future space pods and what life would be like out in space yeah it's it's pretty neat i still think it's a long ways away though well actually it needs to be put off for a little while for now just because there's so much money going into it that would be a whole lot better spent on on local problems um-hum yeah yeah um the health care and and uh law enforcement uh um-hum yeah and and i tell you the you know it's expensive oh yeah just just i mean space programs themselves you know i uh i work in the uh in the satellite telecommunication business and putting up satellites is ridiculous expensive and these things are unmanned just a bunch of electronics we shoot out in space you know um-hum uh-huh uh the bulk of them probably have aren't even pressurized uh no no  okay i pressed the button so okay let me tell you i haven't been too many places you haven't been to too many places no no i haven't okay well i've been to Hawaii see now that's where i wanna go that's where i've always wanted to go i've never been there oh it's it's beautiful i know ah is it is it um i had an aunt that lived there and she she couldn't stand it anymore she moved out because she said the whole island was taken you know being taken over by the Japanese well there is there is a lot of Japanese over there and they're yeah and she and um she also told me that well not her uh necessarily other people that have been there said it's it's too commercialized um-hum ooh well yeah there's it's commercialized but there's still a lot of beautiful places to go and see is it yeah you know uh on all of the islands you know now the gisland of of Oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands but sure uh-huh but it's still beautiful you've got to see it at least once you know oh well i will eventually what well what is what's the most uh you know the nicest island so uh i like Maui Maui i think that's usually what people uh say they didn't they like the best yeah i mean i like it because the beach is nice and white and you know it's like um Oahu you can go over there lay on the beach and it's really nice uh-huh where the island of Hawaii you really can't lay on the beach over there you know yeah but um in Kauai it's and i mean their beaches are nice but i don't know just not nice as Maui yeah and then uh have you where have where have you been well i have been to California i've been to San Francisco i loved it i absolutely loved it oh you have oh yeah and um how long ago oh uh eighty six hm okay my sister lives out there my sister lives in Piedmont oh yeah i know where that's at because i used to live in Oakland yeah uh-huh oh well that's right near Piedmont right so yeah right right yeah well yeah that's like a suburb or something what is that oh yeah okay well she lived in Berkeley also and she yes uh-huh uh-huh um-hum let's see i went when she was uh living when well like when i went out there she was in um now i can't oh Lafayette she was living in Lafayette oh yeah right and then they moved to Piedmont um-hum so i uh i haven't seen uh you know her house in Piedmont but but i love San Francisco i'd like to go back yeah did you go in the cable cars and everything yeah isn't that fun oh yeah went to Alcatraz you know we did the whole bit and then we went to the wine country oh yeah up by Napa yeah yeah yeah oh beautiful and uh we went to Carmel you know and we took the eighteen mile drive um-hum isn't that pretty i love it down there oh it's beautiful it's really beautiful my girlfriend was down there a few months ago first time she's been down there and they wanted to take that drive and they had closed the whole road because of of fog yeah um-hum oh what the weather so then she they never got to do that um well i have also been to the Carribean oh i haven't been there either you name it i haven't been there i well i've i been there a couple of times uh-huh i went on a cruise oh that's nice the last time i went i went with my two sisters uh-huh and it was over Christmas time yeah and we really had a good time uh-huh well they um had this cruise director dress up like Santa Claus and we went to the beach and they had put a Christmas tree on the beach decorated it up and it was it was a lot of fun um-hum uh-huh well that's nice is is that cruise nicer than it if you just go on a regular you know to a hotel or you know it is now i've heard it is yeah so oh yeah yeah because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know you put your clothes in your room and oh you'll have to go on one um-hum you don't get seasick that's what i'm afraid of no no i mean there was some people did no huh um on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in but that's unusual uh-huh yeah um one of my sisters got sick but the other one didn't and i didn't uh-huh you know but um it's really nice and they just they just do so many things for you you know to make you enjoy the trip and everything right yeah so you'll have to do that once i wanna go on another one but i wanna go to Alaska oh yes now someone i know was was on a cruise to Alaska and uh um-hum um-hum was it Alaska yeah i'm pretty sure that's right my hairdresser she went last year she said she went on a cruise and i'm thinking you know cruise i'm thinking oh really sun and she's laying on the beach i said well you're not very tan for someone who's been on a cruise she says we went to Alaska yeah right you know and uh that that's uh i'd like to go well Hawaii would is my uh is my is number one i'd also like to go to Australia have you oh i i think i would like to too yeah i keep hoping to win the lotto for i can do all these things you know oh well see i i'm just into the Publisher's Clearing House and the Reader's Digest because we don't uh right now the lottery here  what was the last vacation you went on anyway well we went to California over Christmas um-hum so that was nice we traveled by car though and that wasn't real nice because i have four children ooh that's a long trip with four kids in the car it surely was yeah uh that sort of a trip can be kind of long just by yourself well yeah we went to spend Christmas with my my family there and then my um girls are real involved in soccer and so we had a soccer tournament there also but well that works out yeah it was real nice the weather weather cooperated and and it was real pretty there how about you where have have you gone mostly East uh yeah uh yeah so far the about as far East as i've gone uh trip about five years ago up to uh Minneapolis uh flew up and then drove back oh how was the drive back uh well uh the weather was wonderful the roads were fine uh the car i was driving back was a problem it kept wanting to fall apart oh that's no good basically i was bringing it back for the sons of a the lady i was renting from huh uh because one son living up there owned it wanted it rebuilt uh and restored and son back here was going to do it but couldn't get loose for a couple few days to go up and get it yeah so what time of the year did you drive oh that was uh in May the weather was wonderful yeah i was gonna say the weather probably was real pretty then yeah um flew up it was the first time i'd flown and uh flew up just above uh thunderstorms that stretch from Texas at least up into uh the Great Lake area yeah they have some whopper of thunderstorms out on these plains so we're watching oh yeah yeah we got to watch i got i got to watch uh thunderstorm from the other side for once unique experience yeah the lightning from the top side is a unique experience lots of lightning yeah i always enjoyed watching it from the bottom side but it's even more fun from the top huh now um most of our vacations though have been you know camping trips of one sort or another or just going home to see family and now i hear that you have children in the background i well actually i'm at a pay phone the post office oh um no i do have one child he's about twelve weeks old twelve and half weeks old now oh congratulations you'll be taking him on some of trips then i guess why thank you yeah yeah from looks of things wife and i are both in school yeah the next trip is probably going to be next Christmas uh several of my siblings have decided that it'd been too long since we were home for Christmas now where's home uh West Virginia uh that's home for me oh yeah uh i met her down here so her home town is only about uh an hour and half drive away huh but uh i'm a thousand miles from home so they're supposed to they're they're trying to arrange to get us train tickets uh to go up home three of us oh like an Amtrak yeah huh have you been to Georgia yep i've been through the northwest corner of Georgia that's been it uh that's pretty much in route between here and home yeah yeah so there's about a nine mile stretch of Interstate fifty nine that cuts through the northwest corner of Georgia yeah well we went there last summer again for a soccer tournament and it was just beautiful there but uh yeah yeah they have some kind of vine there that grows up and down and up and down trees kudzu yes that was it yes this stuff is an absolute white on humanity it seems yeah but it's so pretty is it's pretty it it's it when it's genetically engineered that's the that's the southern version of what they've got up north called multiflora rose which is also engineered and it's almost indestructible yeah huh i mean you about have to expose the you know the first four feet of the soil to you know high levels of radiation to kill it off it this stuff is incredibly durable yeah see i kept talking about how beautiful it was and the natives there just would roll their eyes like you're crazy this is awful stuff but i remember calling home and saying it's too pretty here all i'm staying forever yeah yeah its well you see that stuff what eventually take over everything and literally kill off large old trees if it gets the chance yeah oh so most that states in the Southeast have uh spraying programs where they go in with defoliants and try and kill it off so do you have that there here in in Hattiesburg area no not yet but apparently it moving this direction and me yeah not yet uh huh it's coming huh actually up in the Delta you know four or five hours drive north along the Mississippi River they've got it there too uh-huh but right now it hasn't really hit the uh the the general area around here place yeah so what about South have you been to Florida uh one trip i used to be an auto mechanic uh-huh and one evening i got sent down into let's see Fort Walton Beach with a wrecker to tow a van back for a yeah  okay have you painted something lately yes i have that room i showed you and then since then we painted the bedroom yeah oh yeah another bedroom yeah i showed you that one too didn't i the brown one yeah the one that looks like a fudgesicle hm yeah yeah yeah oh yeah oh heavens well i painted the outside of my house and one bathroom but i get i have that trouble with the the ceiling you know the uh what is that blow the blow ceiling yeah yeah oh yeah you know where you get around the edge well i've heard now i asked Janice somebody recently about how how you do that uh-huh oh uh when you paint the ceiling if you know when you got that textured stuff that they'd have special rollers uh-huh that are real soft and furry that you'd paint that with how you get the edge you just have to be real careful well how do you get the edge though the the straight edge oh i see we use a a two inch brush with uh on a slant uh-huh uh-huh and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes huh but well are you willing to paint the outside of your house too well yeah i think i'm going to do it this spring actually oh really there're there're six houses see the people that own the house they uh pay for anything like that we do as far as the the materials there's three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses oh oh nice yeah so i'm thinking i'm gonna change it to something you know the brick is multicolor with mostly earth tones i think i'm gonna put something like a brown on it uh-huh oh that'd be nice on the outside yeah and maybe a little deeper brown in the entry way or something something where it'll stand out a little hm or two tone or two tone what color'd you paint what yeah you know there's some columns that could be painted a different color too what color did you paint your house uh-huh well the white but i have a problem i can't get up high and we can't paint the chimney on the outside well you got to get one of those ladders well we have one of those ladders we're just not willing to get up that high oh yeah well a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood he's done his house and that's what he i was out there last weekend he's finished everything except the chimney well we did too we did it in the fall and it's just it's too high it's really scary but yeah and the only thing i would consider doing a professional is maybe doing that but is other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional yeah yeah i know our house in New Mexico it was stucco but we had all this trim to paint and a lots of it yeah and we did basically seventy five percent of the house and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff uh-huh so i hired this man to come in and do it young kid and he came with with his own rafter uh what do you call those things no those where you built like a rafter thing uh-huh the blowers oh oh oh oh i know what you're talking about um scaffolds that's it yeah scaffolds yeah he came and did it that way and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up huh and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because all the places that i had left for him were above huge humongous cactuses and if he fell he was dead and he knew that so it's yeah oh my so that was worth it getting a professional for that yeah plus he cleaned up my mess oh i think that's what we might have to do with the chimney but other than that it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself yeah it wasn't too bad i mean you save how much did it cost you to for the paint for the outside shoot maybe a hundred and fifty yeah you know since it's a one story but we did uh like two heavy coats over it but in in in that way you know you're assured you did a good job than you are you know if you hire someone to do it yeah that yeah that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to oh Furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh my word and anyway he when he checked out they only and and he was using his Furrows charge card too they only charged him for one gallon of paint like thirteen bucks or something um-hum um-hum oh my word and he had he had the bill he had already carried a ladder outside and and told her that and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint uh-huh uh-huh so she had to start all over again and he when he got outside he noticed his receipt was for like thirteen ninety nine or something uh-huh oh my word so that was really worth it painting his own house and he saw it i guess yeah it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff oh my word oh my word well he really saved in that way but yeah i think we're gonna to do uh another bathroom yeah uh but uh i think i'll probably just do it in a roller i wanna do it about the same color and just be a little yeah rollers are so messy we never mess with them anymore oh i know but it's that it's the textured wall well still a paintbrush he can still  well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today um well i have i have two kids in school and and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less of of the year than than kids in other countries um-hum um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that only uh only occurs in the United States um-hum um do you have any kids in school no i don't so i'm a little bit out of it i can look back to my to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about yeah yeah things going on yeah well some of the some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system yeah they're moving to that out there and uh i guess there's pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so yeah if you wanna take a vacation you could uh-huh i hear that they that in at least in the system that's going out um in California where that i'm familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule yeah so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but it could it could one of the other um things is that um uh there's been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also um-hum that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries um-hum yeah yeah and that's not a favorite subject for either of my my kids it's probably not um-hum for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people go to private schools instead yeah yeah yeah well i hadn't thought about those things but those are problems um some of the some of the people that i work with uh they're they're some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their system's the best but the the ones in um-hum England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer um-hum and i i think that dates back to when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and it's been quite a while since that's been the case for most part now right yeah yeah there's no need for it anymore and it seems though that's one of the things that ought to to change um-hum um-hum uh i'm not i'm not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one um-hum and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation right yeah tends to make some crowds um-hum did you go through the public school system yeah i did uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in my family but seems like uh uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but that's of course not available to to the average person with right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and yes uh-huh and for lots of different reasons you know that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it yeah yeah i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that yeah that that would help yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system it's not really the fault of the school system but there's a lot of you know it's just uh i don't know kids are exposed to a lot that you can't shelter them eventually eventually but it's hard at a young age some of the pressures and yeah uh-huh yeah the i i think that's why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what they're exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons yeah yeah um-hum um the other thing that's happening now i guess is is yeah  the reason i was thinking about trials by jury and um i i guess i thought more highly of it until the uh recent William Kennedy Smith case where they uh were telling about how they used um uh-huh um-hum what they consider scientific methods to choose the right jurors to get the right results you know for their chance what do you think about that uh-huh uh-huh well um you know it's it's like anything else i mean i guess i probably should mention i am an attorney and i and i although i don't do trial work now i have done so in the past and um uh-huh uh-huh i have to say that i've never been in the position to uh uh make use of uh the types of techniques but for years there have been uh books written that everybody has access to about techniques in jury in jury selection um-hum and um you know uh i mean it kind of the way it kind of really actually works out in real life i don't think it's fair um necessarily for one side because they have a lot of money yes to be able to uh you you know it it kind of it strikes me as as unfair that if you have got enough money you can pick the jury you want and really the system doesn't exactly allow that anyway right right the best the best you get on jury selection is is if you've got to pick a jury of twelve people you get a certain number of what they call preemptory strikes and a certain number of of um each side gets those and and then there are are strikes you know an unlimited number of strikes for what they call for cause um-hum and uh you you know obviously people whose whose livelihood depends on um jury jury trials are going to use whatever they can use to try uh to improve their chances and and you know it's get it's right the unfair part of it is that not everybody has access to the high powered technique but then then the the saving grace is that it can only get you so far um-hum i mean you know it it you may find that the first three people on the panel are ideal jurors for you but the other side is probably going to even if i was sitting there with no uh-huh um high-powered computer input and whatnot if i could just ask them questions i could tell that they're gonna be good jurors for you and bad jurors for me i'm gonna strike them so you're not going to get them right i mean you can't really get what you want right you can just improve your chances of guessing who you think you want yes well i know um fairly recently when that um one of the court sessions for John Wylie Price i remember that um uh-huh and though i had agreed with some of the things he did i i disagreed with that particular case because he um they made they got a lot of mileage out that they that that was not a jury of his peers that um they said you know that he was found guilty and then he uh then they made note that none of the the jurors were uh black or African African American and and it seemed to me that if he wanted if they wanted that um i mean they chose them deliberately i mean because of all of the publicity that it got from that um-hum um-hum and i really thought well you know one of their points that they made on purpose was they chose people who they felt were not their own peers in order to make the case against him weaker and it just seemed like it wasn't very fair that that you know that was something that could have been said at the very beginning and not cost the tax payers the money for that court yeah well you know it's it's kind of been uh uh you see a lot in the death penalty cases um-hum that there a lot of the attorneys there are attorneys who strongly believe that the death penalty is not right um-hum and they um have pretty much dedicated themselves to doing everything they can to prevent uh people sentenced to the death penalty from being executed right and they will go through endless appeals and one of the things that has been used and and it's been used most often um in in in the death penalty cases is the fact that you know that the the majority of people who are convicted if they're black they may not have any blacks or they might have one black on their jury panel right and they have tried to statistically tie this to the likelihood of him getting the death penalty um-hum but they've never really been successful in it and the Supreme Court has has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments saying that that somebody didn't get a fair trial because there wasn't a certain quota of blacks on the jury panel right right and i really do think that those arguments will continue to fail because  did you hear the topic Carol yeah something about uh returning goods and uh if they're getting any better than they used to be right i haven't had any real uh recent problems with that i've been a little bit leery i have mail ordered uh a uh video camera from New York and i was worried that that might uh cause me a problem but so far it looks like it has been a good deal oh well good i feel the same way just the last few years things i've purchased have been you know pretty good quality and worn well as far as clothes or have driven well as far as cars and sort of have lasted uh-huh you know for a good part just can you hold on just one sec yes i got a six year old that's going out of off of his mind he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar oh i think i think the only problem i've had in the last two or three years is i was i was in Germany a couple of years ago and bought a comforter and some pillows and some pillow cases i didn't receive everything but you know that's you sort of take that chance you buy something like that uh-huh do you buy um do you buy much mail order pardon me do you buy much mail order oh a little bit uh-huh have you had any problems with that at all no i just bought one of those little handy dandy Singer sewing machines my wife you know when you're using you're the little small one that fit in your hands oh uh-huh i purchased one of those the only complaint i might have there is it takes so long to get the item oh yeah well some some places are good about sending them out by UPS or or other ways but i think most of the time i uh maybe it's just the kind of shopper i am i will uh decide on the kind of thing i want and try to do my homework to to find which brand i think is probably going to be the best thing and uh generally i am you know pretty well happy with it afterwards sometimes you may find it uh on sale elsewhere but uh maybe it's the kind of shopper determines what kind of goods you get know what i am saying you bet yeah a lot of times i'll do the same thing one thing that happened recently is about three weeks ago i bought a new pair of glasses and uh-huh two days after i bought them i picked them up and i went back two days later which is four days after i purchased them to uh get them adjusted and i noticed they were running a thirty to sixty off sale so i paid the higher price so i did you know ask for a little interview with the manager and he came over oh he he granted me a few free goods you know to make up the difference uh-huh well at least they're which i thought was fair trying to uh give you some kind of concession there sure but overall i think i'm uh i'm trying to think what the last thing was that i turned in or wanted to take back i bought some clothing i don't know if you get these Lands' End catalogs no they uh make mail order clothing and most of it's very good i bought five or ten shirts i would guess over the course of oh probably four or five years and um they've been very good with the exception of one that had the uh button hole kind of pulled away from the front of it right and uh any trouble getting it back no they're real good in fact i've had the shirt for uh actually i probably had it for over a year sure and the only reason i called them on it is because i'd had similar shirts that held up for several years and uh they said uh regardless that you've you know worn it for a year or over a year we'll uh take it back and give you a new one i try to buy most of my clothing from like the the bigger guys the uh the dealers of the world people like that because they they don't have any trouble returning goods they they purchase so much from these manufacturers you know they can return anything huh yeah right so you're just generally speaking you never have a problem taking something back to them because it didn't wear properly or it came apart or something well i think that's uh that's really just good business you know you bet if you want repeat business which a lot of those retailers do you've got to really bend over backwards to treat the customer and make him feel like they have occasion to go back and wanna go back you bet you know that's like i've seen on this mail order if they were uh skin flints about it and wouldn't take it back i mean they they uh depend on that kind of a reputation so much oh absolutely you know yeah mail mail order the same thing i buy a few things from Kebelsk oh yeah this they're sporting aren't they uh-huh right and sporting goods and uh sort of the same way you can uh have uh have a certain amount of time period while you can just return something if you're dissatisfied with it in anyway and they're very easy get along get along with and they don't mind taking something back yeah uh-huh you said you'd bought uh cars recently what kind of cars have you boughten i bought a Lincoln oh and uh up with the exception of someone hitting me and uh me tearing it up a little bit it's been a very nice car about a ninety one it's about a year old now uh-huh uh-huh you haven't had any problems with it though huh no not really you know it's like the old uh saying they don't build things like they used to and i really believe that in some situations but in probably in cars that's very true uh-huh but they don't build them like they used to but what's your feeling about American versus foreign and  okay um we're guess we're supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time um um-hum i basically read books uh-huh what i do sometimes when everybody's off gone to bed my kids are in bed my husband in bed i just every once in a while i'll just stay up and finish a book that i'm i usually have about three books that i'm going on i'll work on one for a little bit you know and then on the next one but that's kind of well that's pretty impressive to have three books going not always just sometimes oh yeah and and what kind of books do you read um just really different ones um i had one that i was reading on um raising your children and another one on a on a biography and another one on a um um like a crime story you know a truth crime story oh yeah oh do you like those detective stories yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was reading that one last night oh well that's interesting i i actually like to read also but i usually fall into one of two categories either true science fiction or fantasy on one hand or highly technical yeah its like my husband yeah yeah kind of one or the other you must uh work for TI yeah my husband does too i i do yes yeah and i'm a computer scientist yeah it gets but i have a lot of other hobbies i i well yeah i i i'm kind of um uh-huh really i i guess what you'd call it a project person yeah and i love i like i have a shop and oh really when things break around the house i always try and fix them myself and so hobby it's it's it's its funny uh from the one stand point it's work but it's a hobby too that that i enjoy to do to find broken yeah yeah like what kinds of things do you fix well essentially anything you'd find in a house uh a a stove or an oven or a broken piece of porcelain or uh chipped tile on the floor i mean just anything oh and you have a shop well it's it's not anything elaborate it's just a work bench with a gazillion tools yeah but enough that again for anything in the house i can probably yeah you can fix just about everything and anything right well that's great and in the car i guess the car too yeah yeah so that's i i think i would probably consider that a hobby although sometimes it gets to be excessive yeah that's that's pretty much like my husband he's he's pretty uh mobile in that area too he he works on the cars we barely take them in yeah i he works on irons irons and all those TV's and stuff too we rarely have to take those things in too right yeah i i think it it it it not only can it be fun but it can certainly help your finances oh yeah yeah definitely so do you have any artistic um i wanna i guess i wanna say creative or artistic hobbies um gosh not really i mean i during Christmas i work on you know like um holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things but oh yeah well that's good but um not really yeah well i don't necessarily either i can plink out a song or two on a piano and i can oh um i i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art i guess graphics arts is that what that would be called it i can't like do any of that but sweat shirts is certainly impressive yeah yeah uh-huh um i belong to this organization for um with if you have preschool children you know um-hum and uh every once and a while they'll have a a craft um session for the moms oh yeah and those are really neat and we learned to do the um transfer pictures on the sweatshirts oh yeah transfer photos and um those are really neat so we learn different crafts like that um uh-huh i see well that's neat that's a i guess i consider that a hobby do you do you cook for a hobby or do you yeah no i cook dinner and its not i don't consider it a hobby but um do you that's something you i understand that you know i no i'm not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately i like to bake off and on and usually once a week i'll bake something but its not yeah anything elaborate you know at least i don't think it is yeah so but i think that still borders on hobby yeah probably the other thing i do which i'm sure it'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer uh-huh so i'll i have little projects little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies uh-huh but drive my wife crazy oh well good you have a computer at home i do yes oh good yeah in fact there's actually several of them here right now not not all of them being mine oh really wow then you are busy yeah wow that's really good so uh i wonder if you you could construe raising children as being a hobby well you know one of the books that i did read that i was reading and i stopped because it's so its the book is so detailed and you have to sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again because i didn't quite get it all um-hum and uh it is so detailed  well i subscribe to a few magazines on a regular basis how about you oh yes i do um i always enter those things that come through the mail you know that's right yeah yeah they do oh really they like you so i have just about everything at sometime or other really how many how many uh would you say at any given time you tend to subscribe to oh probably no more than say five at the time uh-huh uh-huh what are your favorites well i like uh McCalls Reader's we subscribe to that one now too yeah uh-huh Reader's Digest Redbook um Good uh let's see Good Housekeeping Better Homes and Gardens um and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh do you like that one i had i had started that one about a year ago thinking that it would be a nice way to get some decorating tips and and more interior kinds of things but um it's really a collection of everything it has got a lot of um home making kinds of things too you know food as well as indoor and outdoor stuff uh-huh yeah i i love to get recipes you know out of the magazine i cut them out put them in a book and yeah uh-huh yeah uh-huh me too i'm not sure that i use them as often as i think that i will but i sure uh pay attention to them and cut them out oh yeah oh i also um usually get a magazine about travel and um do you use the tips and a suggestions do you do you travel often enough that you are able to to take advantage of it not not really um uh uh-huh just fun just sort of i i read them and you know get ideas but um i don't travel that much uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so but i the thing i like about magazines is that they are a wonderful diversion for a brief period of time if you feel like you are not in the mood to really sit down with a book for a long time it's it's a perfect short uh attention getter yes it really is yeah and um oh i like the uh beauty tips and you know all that fashion stuff and um uh-huh uh-huh do you do you have favorite fashion oriented magazines no not really i i just read them a from the magazines that i get i don't really take a fashion magazine or anything uh-huh oh uh-huh none that are specifically focused on fashion oh no just just what's in the regular magazines yeah i have a friend who works for a magazine that's based in France called Elle but uh and and i remember seeing it enough times at her house that i wondered how often people subscribe to those kinds of magazines because you almost have to be in the business to be as intrigued with some of those fashions they're so bizarre yeah that's true it's we all have to change our wardrobe regularly enough to invest in the magazine that's uh that's right you sure would oh yeah i you know keep entering these contests taking all of these magazines thinking i'll win that big Publisher's Clearing House yeah right oh and there's several others that uh i get through the mail and uh you know they have contests like that not as big as that one but anyway i've always been kind of a sucker i guess for magazines well that's sort of another uh added attraction of those uh contests i guess you could probably enter the contests without getting the magazines but it's not much fun yeah you can yeah that's true um Redbook i've always taken Redbook for years and years and years they used to have a novel in the back um-hum oh really yeah but they quit doing that and i sure miss it hm i don't know Redbook very well what what does it tend to be a mix of uh fashion and and recipes and that sort of thing or what what did yeah it's similar to like McCalls or something like that yeah oh is it uh-huh yeah not too much different tend to focus more on women's issues than yes definitely uh-huh yeah but they have some good short stories too uh-huh um-hum um-hum and uh but i really miss that novel it used to make to take me oh say a Sunday afternoon you know i'd crawl up on the couch with my Redbook and read the novel uh-huh that's interesting i always thought that that was a big enough attraction in a lot of magazines that they i'm surprised that they would get rid of it yeah i don't know why they did i never did hear anything at all about it all of a sudden it was just gone um-hum um-hum McCalls certainly has changed a lot of over the years yeah they used to be a big magazine and you know they cut the size down and uh-huh all but uh i used to get one called Savvy that went out of business or merged or something and since i had only half the subscription through they automatically switched all their readers instead of Savvy got McCalls and that's how i got introduced to it oh is that right well i can remember yeah seeing Savvy i don't know that i ever subscribed to it but i've seen it you know in yeah i liked it i thought it was kind of a nice  no we just uh i guess i'm hot on this subject because we just spent three weeks camping in a recreational vehicle uh where did you go we took a tour of Florida well interestingly enough i'm calling from Miami okay well i was down there visiting the uh the orchid jungle uh-huh there in uh Homestead yeah came back with about ten plants that i hadn't planned on well yeah yeah we were down past Miami went down into the Keys well you know that's something i've never done is go down to the Keys although i i'm just here on business but uh i would love to go down there um well we found it a little bit of a disappointment uh we had expected some nice warm sunny days we got two days above seventy yeah and uh we thought the beaches would be nice but uh uh well Key West was uh just coral rubble yeah and uh we did find Bahia Honda was a fairly nice state park it had a nice beach uh-huh but the water was running about seventy five degrees so it was kind of hard to get the kids to to go in and and snorkel and and do those sort of things yeah well i've never done any motor home camping although uh uh it it is more attractive to me now than it used to be when i was a kid uh we used to go camping up in the Ozarks in Arkansas um-hum and uh we found a pretty remote campground uh uh actually whenever we first started going to it you had to drive about twenty five miles on a gravel road yeah to get back up into it and uh it had uh no electricity and uh it had a hand pump for water but it was on a lake that was just crystal clear and we would spend a week up there you know and they had a a little country store about ten miles away that you could get you know minimal provisions so you pretty much had to carry everything you needed with you yeah but uh that was it was great fun but since then i honestly have not done much what you could call camping hum well my uh my wife talks a lot about camping and uh she's taken the girls uh on off to Girl Scout camp a couple of times but my idea of camping is in a either an RV or in a thirty thirty five foot sailboat yeah well now yeah you kind of remind me of a friend of mine who who said her idea of roughing it is slow room service right but uh yeah i've got a uh i've got a friend of mine in Houston who has a forty two foot uh Tartan sailboat yeah and uh it which has for me has been the best of all worlds because he's got the expense and i get the pleasure of going out on it yeah i did that for a number of years i crewed for a fellow that uh was doing a lot of racing well that's hard work and uh and well it was fun it was quite enjoyable yeah i've i've been with it on on several uh races we've run the Pensacola yacht race for a couple of years um-hum and uh but no i love to sail and i agree i had never thought really thought about that as camping before but that is that is probably one of the best ways to go yeah what did you do did you rent a motor home when you came to Florida yeah we rented one from uh Cruise America was it what is that expensive uh it was running about eighty seven dollars a day well that's cheaper than a hotel room really that's cheaper than a hotel and you add uh oh maybe another twenty five dollars for that for a camp site uh-huh and you know the hookup and water and sewage and so forth how big was the one you rented we had a uh thirty two footer yeah was that uh any problem driving or well it's it's a big truck uh but uh yeah when you get that big a truck the uh the fuel economy goes to pot if you try to push it at sixty five and you get pretty decent fuel economy at fifty five oh really so uh i just uh had a change of mind set and i would set the uh autopilot on fifty five and just cruise down the highway well everybody else wants to speed so they wind up passing you yeah and you just stay in the right lane and there's nobody in front of you and all you have to do is guide it yeah yeah yeah so it's kind of a pleasant way to drive you uh i've found that i get there just about as fast as anybody else because there will be some cars that i'll pass two or three times during the day the same one oh sure yeah yeah that always irritates me when i pass somebody several times i've i've been in the other in the other uh uh uh had the shoe on the other foot yeah because you go down there and some hotshot will go by you that you know he's got a colorful car that you recognize and uh-huh the next thing you know you know it's lunchtime he's got to stop for lunch and you just holler at your wife to make you a sandwich yeah yeah right right right and uh well we enjoyed it uh one of of places we visited was uh Walt Disney World uh  are you there okay now tell me your favorite team um-hum uh baseball yes well i've been kind of been intrigued with the Rangers uh more so with uh uh their management than anything else i'd i don't follow baseball that that closely but uh since you know since i live here so close to Arlington uh that's the team that i've been kind of following okay i think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us where do you think they're headed so we'll have to talk about the future with the Rangers um-hum right what are your thinkings on what they can do what they'll be able to do well i think that uh you know with uh so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money it's um you know i think i'm not real sure about that do you know anything about Ruben Sierra's uh well i heard tonight on the news that he is willing to come down on his yeah that he was willing to come down a little bit and uh if the Rangers will go up a little bit yes and the Rangers go up a little bit um-hum yeah but a little bit from three you know from thirty million dollars or thirty five million that's a lot of money i think the entire baseball yeah they're the ones that probably are paying the highest yeah they are and i think this is absolutely ridiculous um-hum and i really think i really think that uh that they ought to no i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money i think they should uh uh pay him what his salary's going to be uh and let him because he's got one more year before he turns into a a free agent that's right and then uh who knows if he produces next year they may have to end up paying him anyway but if he doesn't then his market value will go down and they can pick him up for for a lot less than than they would uh if they paid him the six you know the six million dollars a year this year what i saw on the news today that Buechele Buechele was back just to visit uh-huh i'm awful sorry he's not still oh yeah but you know what he that was a great deal for him oh i'm sure it was yeah it was a great deal for him and and uh he just signed on uh i think it was like a five year deal with uh Pittsburgh yeah Pittsburgh so you know he's real happy there as far as the Rangers are concerned i think i think they need some definitely need some pitching yes sir uh and so i you know i well what do you think of Howse who is the coach for the pitchers um the pitching coach yes well you know i was just looking at the news tonight and they showed a a a black guy that was going was helping out uh his assistant his assistant and i think that's a a great addition i mean he seemed to know what he was doing and and uh um-hum i really wish they could see fit to get rid of Howse oh you don't like Howse huh no no i really don't and i'm not going to stand up you know on my soapbox and say that but i'm not fond of Howse and i'm not fond of Grieves oh Tom Grieve yeah yeah i'm i'm not sure that um that they're ready to get rid of of uh Tom Grieve yet but Howse might be a different uh situation and i think you're probably right that they that they need some you know some changes in uh pitching coach maybe and um well i'm just gullible enough that i think Bobby Valentine is um uh doing all right and i'm sure well you do huh that's contrary to uh popular belief you know oh i know i know so but i would like so much for these Rangers to get their act together and give um oh uh Nolan Ryan the support he needs oh i know you know it's too bad that uh it has to be a forty two year old guy to to lead the uh the Rangers you know i understand they need to have some some young guys that can take the lead and and uh well i just oh i have so many mixed emotions about all this but i think with their new stadium they should go and let's us have yeah  i guess you heard our conversation our topic for today was clothing right yeah i certainly did how you dress for work and season to season and everything uh uh-huh how do you dress for work well uh uh about the same i dress for school i uh i i'm a graduate i'm a graduate student so i don't have to worry too much about uh what i wear too much of the time sure uh which is nice uh uh i've uh although i do uh a lot of i'm a speech pathology major and so i do a lot of clinical work and when i do clinic work then i have to uh uh look my best you bet look professional yeah unfortunately yeah i understand i'm a i own my own company i'm in the i'm a manufactures rep sales organization and my office is a small office and i'm very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt things like that um-hum um-hum but then when i travel it's a little different situation it's uh suit and sports coat tie and the whole bit because you go to meetings and you're required to look your best and look professional of course yeah sure uh-huh yeah yeah uh do uh do you find that uh on the average do people give uh more credibility or less credibility to a to a professional to professionally professionally dressed individual yeah i think in today's society uh there's more credibility quite honest um-hum i'll always remember i'll tell this real quick story when i graduated college my first job years ago uh thirty years ago twenty twenty nine years ago in fact was selling uh agricultural fertilizer uh-huh i worked for the uh Smith Douglas Division of Borden Chemical and i sold uh you know manure uh-huh and uh i would go out and call on farmers and i was always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls and so uh-huh one day i got up and thought well i'll just go casual and do you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that bib overalls and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional uh-huh and uh he sort of expected me to dress as a professional so uh it was sort of was oh really even even the farmers oh wow you bet even even back then so i've sort a uh been aware of my dress ever since then and try to look my best but but here again i dress casual quite a bit so um-hum uh-huh yeah certainly it depends on who you call on in my business if i call on the the JC Penney company here in Dallas or say someone say Sears and Roebuck in Chicago then i wear coat and tie if i call on just uh a normal little dealer of mine i might be casual uh-huh i call on Oshman's sporting goods again it may be casual or it may be coat and tie so it just it it depends uh-huh yeah it depends sure uh so you don't you uh if you had the choice would you wear a tie or no um probably no uh-huh probably no um-hum because uh today i believe you can get away with it but then it depends on who you're calling on who you're it'd be like your your minister standing up in front of you with no tie you just uh he'd be missing something although he shouldn't be evaluated on that um-hum right right so it is it's it's just different uh-huh yeah that uh that's uh if if you wanted to to uh really get into a hot issue uh well at least in some in some beliefs uh uh how people dress when they go to church is uh is uh sometimes a pretty pretty hot topic yes it is uh unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately i'm uh lightly a Catholic and the people uh that go to my church are you know the Catholics dress very casual you're liable to find um-hum people in jeans and and and whatever but yet the way i was raised i'm a converted Catholic the way i was raised i was raised a Baptist and it seems like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time but i guess that has changed also uh-huh uh yeah i'm i'm a i i go to the Church of Christ i've been raised in Church of Christ and uh i i uh too many times you you hear you hear a lot about what what you're uh supposed you're supposed to look your your Sunday best and uh uh dress in proper attire and uh and sometimes that really disappoints me uh in right in uh when i see in other economic areas uh like in Kentucky sure uh you know people just don't have that and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because they don't have the clothes to wear but at the very that's a very good point i'm from West Virginia so i understand what you're saying there and there it's it's just a very good point uh-huh yeah but uh you shouldn't what's the old saying you shouldn't judge a book by its cover certainly and uh evaluation of of an individual of course i think it depends on the type of job responsibility you have i think you have to dress sort of accordingly um-hum but uh you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and uh or evaluate a person by that um-hum um-hum um-hum but what about season to season does i guess your dress changes uh yeah a little bit uh course in the summer if i can get away with it i wear uh uh a pair of shorts and that's it run around barefoot no shirt or anything uh but uh  it was Lee right yeah Lee what it's Lee uh and you're Bob i'm Bob uh i've been uh thinking about the topic and i think it's uh going to be interesting to see what happens as the criminal justice system responds to the tremendous i guess over load in uh cases they say that these drug cases alone are swamping the criminal justice system you know the Arabs world doesn't do a lot of the things i like but they don't have too many repeat offenders offenders in drugs and murder and a few other things you steal they cut off the hand you steal again they cut off both hands it takes care of it quick i've i've heard that i've heard that uh it takes care of it quick yeah i've even heard that the other end of the continuum some judges who are arguing that uh because the system is so over loaded that uh they recommend decriminalizing some of these things because the courts can't possibly handle all the cases uh two wrongs don't make a right i think its going to be very interesting because its uh yeah it's really become a major expense for us as a society yeah in Texas uh some private enterprise built a few prisons or jails yeah and with with the hope that the over flow from the county or the state would kind of get to them but uh see the evidently the counties and the cities are too scared to use them because of the expense but uh they're having trouble now paying their bills because they're not getting any customers well you know the other i don't understand that the other thing that i think is interesting about this is that they've been experimenting for years in the civil justice system with alternatives to courts where you can rent a judge and i'm wondering whether we'll eventually go to renting a jury um and finding ways uh like The People's Court to try some of these cases i think uh the expense is is enormous have you ever sat on a jury years ago i sat on a rape trial and we let the guy off wasn't enough evidence although i'm sure he did it yeah well it's uh it's it's a major undertaking i mean people have to give up their work and and a lot of their time um-hum and uh i i just think it can overwhelm us pretty easily uh when i hear what people are saying about just the sheer volume of the cases i think you need to get tough with them and quit calling them i don't think they need air conditioned cells and color TV sets they need to be put on hard labor manual and as tough as you can make it no coddling no kissing their and nothing nothing just say hey you committed a wrong and you're going to serve some hard hard time well there are a lot of people who think that that works pretty well and it'll be interesting to see what uh what we go to because it's uh and uh it's push come to shove time as far as i can tell in terms of the sheer volume of this stuff there in San Francisco you have a linteresting place called the Delancy Street House have you heard of it yeah oh yeah it's well known and and it's consistent with what you're talking about in terms of the uh approach to uh the uh you know the people once they get through the trials and i guess you know we're going to see more and more of this kind of thing i think the jury trial system um it's gonna to be interesting to see whether or not it becomes more streamlined uh because of the cost involved in that the uh the topic is an interesting one because of the um uh the price you pay for freedom i guess you know the the requirement that that people be given a trial and and hum and then then the issue becomes what do you do once somebody's found guilty i suppose we was talking to somebody the other day over there in Japan uh they have a very low crime problem and one of the things they do to them in Japan is they publish the name and address and families of the person convicted of a crime and there is such embarrassment to the family that they have to move out of the neighborhood and move to another part of the country yeah yeah yeah well well our family sense of family has eroded i'm afraid in this country but i don't think it'll work here but over there the the way they're doing it it seems to be effective yeah have you uh in Dallas uh seen the newspapers ever print the names of people who were uh uh uh picked up as johns uh in under cover operations i've heard that i've heard that no i haven't they they they've done that in San Francisco and uh you know it's gonna be interesting to see how all these things change as as we look at the cost of it because uh um that the well there was a guy who won in Pennsylvania uh this Senator Harris Wafford who said you know and and in this country everybody's entitled to a lawyer but not everybody's entitled to a doctor and we must spend i don't know what the figure is but jury trials are are just so expensive very very expensive and time consuming and uh so i think that that all of the these things that we're talking about are going to contribute to change and i don't know uh terribly expensive yeah  okay now what is your favorite TV show well it was Newhart and it's gone now and i miss it real bad well can't you find anything else to um to replace uh yeah i think so i like the new Home Improvement sitcom i like any i like most of the sitcoms if they keep me entertained for a half an hour so you don't watch Northern Exposure i do watch Northern Exposure and also for for ever how many years it's been on TV i've been watching Knots Landing oh okay you're having to be in reruns for that one have you seen Brooklyn Bridge no i haven't seen that one yet that is one of it's so clean and so laid back and i'm awful tired of some of the things that they have on TV but this thirty minute story is i would certainly recommend that you try it it uh i don't know my wife i don't know but you know my wife watches all those Rescue 911 Unsolved Mystery things oh okay drives me nuts well i just don't even like to be in the room when all of those are on it's like too much real life and i think it's a shame that our life has to be i mean so many of the tragedies that we have on the movies or on TV no we need something lighter than that have you seen um yeah hm i'll Fly Away i'll Fly Away i think i watched that that's where there there's a lawyer and he has a black nurse or a nanny yes yeah i watched that once when it i think when it the first episode and it just didn't grab my attention well i felt like it was kind of they were trying to copy To Kill a Mockingbird without all the suspense or something um it's not i don't know it it's clean it there again you don't have the violence yeah and um i'm surprised it's even still on because coming at seven o'clock in the evening that's when the children want to watch right and that is not part of it yeah so um actually it's the best time of the year for me for watching TV is is starts around Christmas and will end in April and that's for the college basketball oh um really get involved in that my wife played basketball when she was in high school and college so that's something we can both watch and keep up with which is pretty interesting at time well i'm let's see i believe Texas lost last night is that correct you know i'm not sure if Texas won or lost i can't i don't even keep up with them or either my uh son goes there i just don't keep up with them well you don't have to no my favorite teams are back east and they seem to be the best ones anyway so well don't you ever forget that Oklahoma is not bad but Oklahoma it's yeah well Oklahoma's doing good this year is it Oklahoma State though is the better of the two so yeah is that where you are from Oklahoma yeah that's right um-hum i'm a transplanted Texan Okie um-hum well aren't we all are from somewhere well we've from somewhere is correct so i hope you can find enough TV to keep you happy this winter yeah well there's always actually i'll probably watch too much TV and and uh i think that probably effects me too from just from watching too much well i have recently retired and i find that this is the most boring thing in the world is to sit and watch TV so yeah well i'm at home all the time myself and uh i don't work and i never ever turn the TV on during the day oh you don't well uh just just something i i can't do i won't do and when someone else is here during the day and and like my son's been out of school for a month drives me nuts when he turns that thing on during the day well it's oh it's nice to have the noise sometime it's nice that you don't need that noise well i'm just afraid i won't get things done if if i if there's something there that keep me busy do you work out of the home uh no i have a medical problem and i don't haven't worked for three years so oh so that that just i just stay home and run errands do chores keep you know do the house work for my wife she still works and uh that sort of thing okay what kind of a job did you have when you were working i was an accountant at the medical school here for the food service and it was a very heavy desk and a very busy desk and i'm awful sorry that i'm no longer gainfully employed but they're yeah well  all right Miss Kathy so uh what do you do do you do it regularly and so forth um yeah i do i play basketball on uh a city league and um-hum volleyball and how about you well uh i have been so busy working i just retired about two weeks ago oh congratulations thank you my exercise basically has been what walking that i can get in yeah which hasn't really been quite enough but i could very definitely tell the difference when i have two or three hours off and i run around on campus i'm retired from Penn State University uh-huh and when i have an afternoon to walk around on campus i i very definitely uh see a difference huh and it it i know that walking is good for you and uh i keep reading that it's much better for you than running because of the uh actions of the joints and so forth yeah yep but uh tell me about um your exercise did you take your exercise because you had a problem or you just wanted to stay young and light or whatever um i do it purely for enjoyment in fact when i've started exercise programs that i felt like i had to do you know a system of doing so many sit ups and that i haven't stuck with it and haven't enjoyed it either one so um-hum i decided that i would just stay fit by doing team sports which is what i like more than just individual um whatever how many how many hours a week do you estimate that you perform these things um probably at least an hour a day an hour a day uh-huh yeah do and i have four children so that keeps me busy too and they're all involved in sports mostly soccer so we once they're out there i you know i get out there and kick it around with them sometimes uh-huh do you ever have time when you don't get this exercise in and notice that your weight goes up or anything like that of course of course oh it's so you you can tell the difference oh yeah not so much with weight as much as just not you know you feel sluggish and you get into that cycle where you don't want to exercise and so you don't and then you the the vicious cycle where uh-huh where you don't exercise i i understand what you're saying well what about eating do you uh do anything about the the type of food you eat is that uh or do you just eat a normal balanced meal to go with that yeah i just eat normally i don't regulate you know i'm not real regimented about what um-hum what i eat personally its too hard to to get myself on a certain diet having to fix for five other people in the house so yeah that that does keep you busy yep so you well uh how about you well there're just two of us now my three children have all moved out uh-huh so uh diet wise uh i'm trying to keep us on a low uh weight the low fat type of a diet my wife has high cholesterol uh-huh so i'm trying to keep that down and and i do notice that when you go through periods uh such as Christmas and so forth where you eat out more often than normal if you don't get the exercise in your weight weight goes up yeah and uh for me exercise is one of the nicest ways of bringing that weight down do you do it together with your wife or this mostly by yourself and no it's up until now its been mostly by myself because i would have been downtown and as i say walking around on campus picking up mail and and doing things like that and running running downtown uh during my lunch period yeah well it gives me an opportunity to get some walking in and yeah i was gonna say you probably get a lot of walking in i know that i when i went to college you know just walking back and forth from different buildings you you have to yes do you we have a bicycle in the house uh the kind that you pump you know that you can change the loading and she rides that and that seems to be uh probably other than walking that's probably one of the better things you can do uh-huh huh have you ever tried one of those i haven't i haven't i do i have a bike and you know i usually have a child on the back of it because mine are little uh-huh uh-huh well i was thinking with you say you have four children uh-huh with four children and sometimes there may be times you can't get out to go play you need to stay home that maybe one of these mechanical bicycles would be very helpful to you that would be a great yeah it sure would that would be a great idea well very good well i wish i could get my weight down i need to get out and get some exercise uh as i say i've just retired so i'm just starting to have a few days to uh approach that subject and i'm considering it i'm going to get on that bicycle that we have and uh start doing some riding and i'm sure that's going to be the quickest way to get things under control yeah oh that sounds yeah probably do your kids still live close by you no i have one lives in Amsterdam Holland and uh one lives in uh oh near Warrington Pennsylvania and the other one is in New Jersey uh-huh oh they're spread around what did you teach so well i i have done research at Penn State i've i've uh not a teacher i've done research in under water acoustics oh oh well that yeah well that would be interesting do you study like mammals or just sound it's been a noisy subject  okay it's pressed are you still there okay i'm ready so what's uh things that you look for when you go out to dinner oh i just like a nice quiet nice atmosphere um-hum and of course good food that's always that's always a concern but just a nice quiet easy place maybe candlelight something um um that sounds pretty just to relax you know because i don't really go out to dinner that much so yeah um-hum well we don't go out to dinner that much either we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or something like that but uh-huh i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean you know right um i've been to some that's been terrible you know you see cockroaches crawling around and oh everything you know but i try to get one that's nice and clean and then i like to you know good food and good service yeah so yeah where you don't feel rushed you know and you can just relax and stay as long as you want and yeah right right right so is there some nice places to go to eat in Plano well nearby we're almost in Dallas we're just north of Dallas um-hum so we have quite a bit between us and there it's about ten miles um-hum um-hum and there is all kinds of restaurants and i had one that was a favorite for a long time and then it changed hands and doubled the prices and then it finally went out of business um so but it was really nice it had a fireplace and um that sounds beautiful yeah it was really nice they had entertainment sometimes and you you could just really relax there and enjoy it um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well this is only a little small city um we have uh but it's gone excuse me i didn't think my coughing would come back anyhow we have only like one uh restaurant that's kind of nice you know they have prime rib on uh weekends uh-huh and then then they have about six miles from here is called a little city called Wesley and they have a Wesley Hotel there that they serve food and the atmosphere there is really really nice oh that's nice so and then if we really want to you know something different then we go to Modesto which is like twenty minutes away uh-huh right but uh we don't have any fast foods here in this small city that's probably very fortunate for you do you have kids do i have kids well i have a son but he's grown up yeah oh because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night you know and now she's graduated to two cheeseburgers so something's happened here but but um um-hum you know McDonald's is definitely at the top of her list and i hate these places yeah all the kids seem to love McDonald's don't they you know so uh-huh they do and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have so no no i'm sure there isn't so we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around and it's really it's tempting when you come home from work and you're tired and um-hum you know you just are tempted to give in to that and it costs a lot of money to do it too you know it adds up and it's not healthy and i know it's i i really got into that habit for a while but i got out of it again because i just felt like it was just too unhealthy yeah yeah um-hum so well let's see what else can we talk about well how's California today oh it's foggy and cold here is it that's what i've heard yeah um-hum um-hum yeah it's yeah have you always lived there i came from Iowa when i was sixteen oh so i've lived out in California for a long long time yeah i like it real well and you like it yeah we've been we used to live in Oakland so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there oh yeah you know but uh then i quit work and everything and i moved bought a house i had a condo in Oakland so right in Chinatown so we went to a lots of restaurants and Chinese restaurants uh-huh oh that would be fun and they were really good i really miss them yeah do you miss living there you know uh no i really don't miss living there i just like to go in there and have a nice Chinese dinner once in a while you know no yeah yeah but um as far as missing living there no it's close enough if i wanted to go there to San Francisco for dinner or something why you know hum an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and you know have dinner and then come on back but uh yeah uh-huh have you ever been to California oh yeah i i go all the time oh really yeah well i have a twenty one year old daughter in college there and she um is world champion twirler um um-hum and her coach is in California so she went there for six years um so i went out a lot with her um-hum um-hum and uh yeah i know California pretty well and i love it um-hum yeah i guess and we tug back and forth who's gonna move but i think he's gonna move because i'm the person with more to lose here i have my twelve year old in school um-hum um-hum and she's happy she's always lived here in the south and i've had my house so um-hum i've too much to lose  well i was just wondering if you had had any experience with um the care of the elderly yes i have in fact uh just a little over just a little less than a year ago uh my mother went to be with the Lord and we cared for her the last uh oh seventeen months of her life here in the at home uh-huh aside from uh having to uh take her to the hospital and uh you know those times well she was there in the the regular hospital right and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer and so the doctor elected to have her uh finish out uh in the hospice program um-hum and uh i as far as i'm concerned that is far and above any nursing home because uh she's around her own family you know the the elderly parent in question is around their own family the uh hospice program provides a hospital type bed well it is a hospital bed and all the oxygen stuff and a uh and a visiting nurse at least every other day et cetera et cetera et cetera well that's nice and it's all taken care of by by uh Medicare uh and uh it it's it's really neat uh and i you know i wouldn't i wouldn't banish uh my old loved one to a to a warehouse no and that's that's what i basically uh view a nursing home as a warehouse so that's it's really sad pardon me it's really a sad situation uh-huh no and uh i think a lot of people struggle with oh uh i guess the problem is that the spouse of whoever you know the parent is um-hum doesn't always want the in-law living in the house is that right right well that's really sad yeah i know but uh in this case uh spouse and i uh are uh we're are are are uh united in this area because i guess her father her grandfather and grandmother both lived with uh um-hum her parents uh their their their golden years to so um-hum this isn't like uh uh just one one uh instance in fact uh her uh uh experiences were were invaluable to me um-hum uh in fact i don't know if i could have uh held up uh you know without my wife uh helping in this this this case right yes well i know when the i remember being a child and my grandmother had had several several strokes and things and that we had my parents tried to keep her in the house and they did for a long time i couldn't tell you how long until she got uh where she had to have complete care uh-huh uh-huh and just they couldn't you know keep her in the house anymore and it was really hard on everyone that she had to have you know twenty four hour a day care and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time just a block or two from our house um-hum um-hum and that um they put her there and we all went just constantly until she died oh okay but it was very hard on everyone to see well you know grandmother be like that and i don't know that you know i don't being so young i don't remember why um-hum you know what was why she had to go there well maybe uh uh well as as you say the the care of of grandmother or was was to such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it um-hum well i do remember that she was you know totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way and that that they couldn't they found that they could not you know give her oh boy yeah uh-huh the hygienic care and everything that she needed uh-huh well then then there's almost then there's almost no no uh uh choice left to her then no but like you say there is a tendency for people to be abandoned though you know in the nursing home i do remember the other patients there um uh-huh being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother because they got some interaction with someone right in fact just to just to sit and chat with them for five minutes and and be interested in what they have to say regardless of what it is um-hum right right and i guess that's hard on people to give give up their lives if they're busy they don't you know it's easy to abandon people because we do have the nursing homes i guess um-hum right if you can afford them but anyway well i'm glad it worked out good for your family and then and oh yeah it did and i was just praised i just praised the Lord that that we were able to uh have uh uh be  because uh discuss crime in America and what we might be able uh do to uh help stop it oh okay um well you're in quite a um interesting city for um crime drugs and all kinds of things that we hear about aren't you oh yeah well actually i i i live in Houston i'm in Miami on business oh i see uh-huh uh but i've i've been down here quite a bit for the past oh six months on and off uh-huh i see and yes there is plenty of crime in Miami uh but you know um i don't know that it's any worse than Houston um yeah well it's probably each city i guess has its own specific type of difficulty and i know there's plenty of crime in Dallas too oh there's a lot of homicides in Dallas that seems to be yeah uh well a lot of it is drug related but i i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing uh and it it seems to just lend itself to instantaneous um if you're don't feel good about a certain thing there you go and the crime is committed so uh yeah i have uh i was talking with some with with a friend of mine not too damned long ago and i'll tell you it it's you know i don't expect this would ever happen in the United States but i'm almost of the opinion that the only way that a change is going to come about is if uh we really put some teeth into the law and and make it such that uh the punishment fits the crime and uh um have a a swift and and sure justice that uh you know do away with some of these automatic uh appeals when uh i think that guilt is proven um-hum oh i see um-hum i'm not sure i know sufficiently about the ins and outs of the law to um know exactly what that brings about you know the the appeals and things like that as far as the people being um retrialed and maybe get an alleviated sentence it does seem though that the jail capacities are stretching to the fullest and uh well in in Houston it's absurd they are letting uh uh people that have been convicted three times for armed robbery um-hum for example and this was they had a big article in the Houston newspaper about it because of the overcrowding they're being released from Huntsville they're given two hundred dollars and put on a bus for Houston with instructions to turn themselves in to a parole officer less than twenty percent or twenty ten percent it was a ridiculously low low number actually do ever report to a parole parole officer and the vast majority of them are then caught again go through the courts back to jail well it's ludicrous and absurd um-hum oh um-hum and i i just don't think that you know we as a society can afford to continue to have these people that are repeat offenders being paroled after serving um-hum um-hum a a fraction sometimes you know a quarter of their sentence um-hum that's right but uh i i don't know it's uh i don't own a gun um uh-huh and uh i you know i believe and i adhere to the thought that you know if you so often i mean it's it's having a gun leads to tragedy that's right i believe that and at the same and at the same time i think i have thought before what would i do if i were accosted um-hum um-hum you know a a fellow i work with uh in Houston he told me uh just this past week his wife was walking out of a mall ten o'clock in the morning in Houston and was robbed oh my in the parking lot oh yes uh-huh um broad open daylight in the parking lot so anyway it it is it's a scary situation and i really don't know what this what the answer um it's very difficult to know what the answer is and uh along with that there's a lot of poverty poverty a lot of homeless and and a lot of um i guess um discrimination is still around and i i suppose until somehow or another we can straighten out all of those things people are just going to take an extreme uh measure and um uh protect themselves in one way or the other yeah i've i'm i'm a firm believer though that uh our justice system has has no teeth any longer that the idea of getting a sentence um-hum uh-huh uh and and knowing that the parole uh will come uh uh just in a short matter of time not only that we have people in jail now that i mean had a program on Sixty Minutes i mean that they have telephones oh in their jail cells it's absurd oh i didn't know that yeah so i mean i don't know oh that's very strange yeah i don't know it's yeah  so i guess most of what happens happens in Salt Lake which is just about twenty miles south of us and that's quite a bit bigger and um-hum they were just talking about how they had all these drive by shootings and stuff and it sounded like it was getting to be like LA a little bit but um-hum do you have gang problems yeah it's there they they say its getting a lot bigger uh well i'm a school principal oh are you so you're right familiar with all that i bet um-hum elementary school well its elementary school oh it's a what elementary but i have gang problems oh yeah oh at that young huh you're kidding at which um-hum i'm in a part of Dallas where there's a lot of gang activity and my i have through the sixth grade uh-huh uh-huh but some of my sixth graders will be thirteen fourteen years old yeah so they're getting started and they get recruited oh you're kidding so uh we we have really very significant problems i'll bet my wife was just uh talking to her mother and uh i guess they said they had an F B I come guy come to there she she works in a middle school and they were talking about how the hats signify you know gang and stuff like that and um-hum yeah and uh that you know it some day it'll eventually past but right now they say there's all kinds of kids getting beat up because of the they wear the wrong hat on the wrong street and that's get it's getting pretty darn scary i've got a little eighteen um-hum um-hum its its surprising to me that it's that true there because the only time i've ever been to Utah it um-hum i spent a week on the Brigham Young campus at a workshop uh-huh uh-huh and it was very uh dramatically different that the people you saw than what we see here because you had no minorities you know and yeah yeah that's true yeah i think we've probably got it to a lesser extent i wouldn't say we're anywhere close to some of those other places probably like what you have but um-hum um-hum it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them in jail and then they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around L A or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but hum you can see it getting a little bit worse and worse it it's pretty sad like you say you see all these kids thirteen fourteen year olds and you know it'll be a school night and they're out at ten eleven o'clock just roaming the streets and um-hum um-hum i just never remember that when you know it's been a while since i was in junior high or high school or even elementary school but um-hum you just i just you were never out past eight or nine o'clock on a school night you know if you were even up out of bed you were lucky it seemed like and but of course you you have a lot of parents that are not really parenting much yeah that's true and you know and i think when it come you have that in Utah pardon you have that in Utah yeah its getting worse i you know like i say i because i would think that big Mormon influence there would uh yeah with with that with that Mormon influence it may not be as bad but we still get a lot of the two uh the two parent income or the two income families and and i really think that's a lot of the problem its just you don't get all the the values taught in the home that you used to get um-hum and and the kids are left to to to do their own thing and find their own you know entertainment and stuff and i I really think that's what you're missing we miss a lot of the those good values that were taught years ago to well i i work in an an area of town like my school uh-huh is about seventy five percent Anglo and that's very unusual in the in the Dallas Public Schools uh-huh yo yeah i would think so yeah but it's very it's like the lowest socioeconomic Anglos oh really yeah it's it's what in the South we call poor white trash uh-huh and then the other uh significant percentage i have is Hispanic uh-huh and course that's growing yeah but the kids that i have the biggest discipline problems with are Anglo children oh really and i i've got lots of Anglo children who are just not really wanted by anybody huh not by their families or anything well and for example i have a boy now he checked out today uh-huh he's fourteen he's in the sixth grade he lived with his mother in Mississippi he had been to he thought ten or twelve schools in Mississippi uh-huh sheesh then his mother now his mother and father aren't divorced but they don't live together in a long time his mother had a new boyfriend who moved in who owed so much back child support for his children um-hum uh-huh uh-huh that they couldn't afford to keep her children anymore so they sent them here yeah and here he was with his father and his father's pregnant girlfriend oh jeez and they pawned all his personal belongings like he had a Nintendo and a VCR and some stuff they pawned that uh-huh and he's just been tearing my school up and he told me he's gonna be bad enough to be sent back to Mississippi jeez and today they checked him out to send him back to Mississippi huh you're kidding you know and that and it's so sad because you i mean sure it's the kids doing it but you know who really is has the blame for that yeah now those kids yeah but yeah but those kids are ready fodder for gangs oh yeah the people show them some interest show them some love and sure they belong gives them something to belong to gives them identity gives them importance yeah um-hum gives them a certain security um-hum and um  did you hear our topic and it's in regards to discussing homes homes yes sir um-hum what are are you settled in a place yeah i'm settled in a place i've been in it for twelve years since nineteen uh actually thirteen years since nineteen seventy eight in it's in Richardson Texas which is North Texas or North Dallas right um-hum and we've lived in two houses in Richardson we moved here in seventy four and uh changed locations in seventy eight okay how about yourself well we uh left here in seventy six uh we were here for a few years then we uh have come back just this summer right now we're looking for housing uh somewhere down in the Duncanville and Cedar Hill area are you familiar that yes nice area yeah it is the kids are in school here in Duncanville we're in a temporary place right now and uh so they've enjoyed the school so we're kind of trying to stay here but are you finding it tough trying to find what you want or well what the problem we got is that we've got five children oh boy and so uh we really want four or five bedroom house and uh you know everybody says you know how many houses are on the market and all that kind of thing so we uh right right we look at the paper we look at our talk to our realtor and you can cut you know the listings uh in about a third and when you go from three to four bedrooms you know or five are you looking or you settled i mean having having finished sure no we're settled and uh we're uh i'm probably older than you i'm fifty two but anyway i my youngest is getting married this year and graduating college so i can board up their rooms and look forward to retirement maybe oh great that empty nest syndrome is gonna set in i guess oh gosh so we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and maybe relocating to Florida or somewhere closer closer to our families great okay okay you are you from Florida originally no i'm from West Virginia but everyone's uh my wife's parents are from the New York New Jersey area yeah so but everyone seems uh has seemed to relocated down that area seems like a nice place to go oh yeah yeah yeah we've got five and the oldest is uh ninth grade and the youngest is second grade and i think they're gonna be uh with us forever i don't know if that's true but it's sure you know we're we're not anywhere near looking to uh uh cut down in size we're we're trying to find the oh i understand you need very minimum of four and probably five oh yeah in fact six would be real good my wife and i can share a bedroom and there as far right it's tough to find a five and six room bedroom house isn't it oh i don't think it's possible unless you you know multimillionaire something like that yeah oh i know seems like when you get in that category you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever and it's that's an awful lot you know oh yeah yeah it is yeah we're um we're having actually if we find something for uh i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand we'll be doing all right you know that's uh but i think the thing's out there it's just a matter of uh right you know looking you know finding the right place uh matter of looking right lot of people will will buy a four in your situation will buy a four bedroom house and convert maybe the garage or something or do or do something i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school and she had uh there were seven kids in her family wow and they converted the dining room and and did this and that they always seemed to get along fine you know oh yeah yeah i think once we get into a place it'll be just fine but um you know it's until then it's uh oh sure oh a little stressful you know just looking all the time and that sort of thing that's all oh i know and it's there's nothing harder than that i always just sort of a assign my wife that chore then i would let her narrow it down to three or four then i'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do oh yeah maybe that's the case at least she's got more opinions you know there's uh seems like there's more constraints more things that she thinks about you know openness uh the size of the kitchen and all this kind of stuff that i would probably gloss over and maybe even ignore you know yes why certainly i understand that so what what kind of business are you in i'm in the uh sporting goods business i'm a manufacturer's rep i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies oh yeah great who who are you with uh we're with an organization called uh Wycliffe Bible Translators it's a a missions organization and uh doing uh translation linguistics that sort of thing uh-huh well great uh it's got an office down here in uh it near Duncanville and we just moved down to be on staff down here so how how was the uh you say you say you lived in the Denver area before how did that compare with this area as far as housing housing prices it right uh we were uh really surprised to find that they're higher here uh no kidding when we moved from Louisiana to Denver it was astounding you know to find that prices were oh i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected and then uh to come down here we thought things would be lower and they're not i guess um really prices for housing are just  so i've been concerned about crime lately um it's really scary to listen to the news every night and to hear about all the problems i wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood um-hum um-hum well i i think we have a neighborhood watch i think i'm not real we don't get real involved we're never home so um uh-huh uh-huh uh well i know they were gonna start one but uh i haven't heard any more since so i don't really know but as far as personally doing something no no hm how about you well we moved in when we moved in there there wasn't any outside lights and so we've been trying to install some uh-huh um outside lights and we put up a fence in the backyard mostly you know not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in but that our children would be safe playing in the yard you know uh-huh yeah yeah huh and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my my kids it's scary to send them off down the street a few houses oh i'm sure it is to let them go play with someone and because of what you hear about people getting picked up and everything and um-hum um-hum um-hum so i have to spend a good deal of time watching them walk down the street and say call me before you leave and come back and uh i would too if i had kids we don't have any we did install a um a uh motion detector light back in our driveway um-hum and that was mainly it was so when we pulled up the light would come on but also we have a boat back there and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief so we thought with that light you know it would um-hum oh no maybe keep them from doing something to the boat yeah so then that's a good thought well we've been real lucky that i don't believe there's been you know much trouble in our neighborhood but it but it does seem there that there is a lot more here in Plano of um just uh-huh bored teenagers vandalism yeah yeah that's what it is we live in Coppell and and that's pretty much what it is is you know um-hum kids that are bored like you say but yeah and they don't uh i know my sister-in-law who lives in our neighborhood they've had their they've parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and uh-huh oh no a few things like that and course you know i don't know i'm getting scared for the kids to get older because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know who and or is it just random uh-huh uh-huh crime but um we've been real lucky that no one in my family with the anywhere that they live has had been a victim of you know a serious crime yeah yeah but uh it's really scary to know that you you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen but it doesn't mean you'll be safe and uh-huh uh-huh i know it hm but i guess i take a lot of um little bit of um safety in knowing that a lot of the crimes that they report are like drug related or um things that places usually that i wouldn't be going and things i usually wouldn't be involved in um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah huh and uh there's not so much of it completely innocent victims compared to but it is scary yeah yeah it is it really is were you raised in this area yeah i'm originally from Chicago but i've been in this area in the Louisville area for uh let's see about twenty three years hm um-hum so has it been getting worse that you've noticed or about the same hm oh definitely in the last few years i think and uh like i say now i don't think necessarily in this area here but um-hum just Dallas in general i don't know i think back of when i was uh younger and in my party days some of those things i did you know i wouldn't be caught dead like being out that late at night in a dark parking lot so right right take a lot of chances well i noticed that um that uh when we we moved here from Houston not too long ago and so of course we were interested in schools and um uh-huh uh-huh um-hum but the schools in Houston all have big tall fences around them and they're not really very safe uh-huh and so it's been interesting to come to the Plano area where the schools don't have fences at all around them and it's just a whole different idea that that at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school uh-huh and in Houston that there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school huh and so that's been something that's been good for the you know in this area that you feel like um you know there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings at school today and i guess i don't know how people live with that everyday um-hum um-hum um i don't either pretty scary yeah hm but anyway well i guess i won't take up more of your time hm  yes okay okay okay um uh what's your house like well it's four bedroom two bath a brick ranch house uh on a kind of a quiet dead end street next to a big wide open field um-hum um but we're two blocks from everything you need including a small mall um-hum and lots of businesses within walking distance but uh um-hum your city is a big city Austin's about a million people oh i guess it is big so it's it's it's it's it's a nice town it's real kind of a laid back place and uh kind of an environmentally conscious city um-hum um-hum um-hum well my i have also have a four bedroom house uh we have three bathrooms two upstairs and one downstairs which makes it nice because um it's right off the garage so when Gene's working on his cars he can come in and take a shower without going through the rest of the house and then um i have a it's in a small city of like um eight thousand people and i don't know if you've heard of Modesto that's the closest big city i've heard of it i've never been there yeah yeah and it's on a cul-de-sac um which makes it nice because there's no through traffic you know about all the cars that come in here are people that just live right in here and uh yeah i like that feature about where we live that was one of the reasons we bought this house is because there's only six street six houses on the on the street so yeah it makes a lot nicer space i say i imagine you have little kids right no no not at all i have uh one kid and he's twenty almost twenty one oh okay well i have one also but he's he'll be thirty seven in uh February so but anyhow i have lots of little neighbor kids and they all love me and i just just worship them they can come in my house i have candy for them and cookies for them you know so i'm just like their aunt Rosy uh we still have there are actually no kids right in the immediate neighborhood but uh we just moved here about two years ago and we still have kids from the old neighborhood which is only a few blocks they come to visit they expect brownies um-hum oh yeah it's yeah they'll they'll stay till you bake a bunch but uh but anyhow as far as decorating my house and everything too i've uh stenciled uh practically in every room in my house which um it looked like it would be very hard to do but it ended up being really easy and it just really just makes the rooms you know i stenciled right above the right below the ceiling line on the walls like it looks something like a wallpaper border but it's actually is a stencil yeah right my wife and i've never tried any stenciling uh we've always thought we she wanted to anyway um-hum uh somehow i feel like this particular house doesn't call for stenciling we've done some wallpapering and uh-huh um-hum uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so um-hum um-hum that seems to be i think she ought to be a paint expert she's just in the wrong career field but uh we watch This Old House faithfully on Saturdays and do all of our own uh decorating work and repair work around the house and yard work um-hum um-hum sometimes it's well you can't afford to have it done you know plus it's fun i enjoy you know going out and working in the yard and oh yeah you know just doing everything decorating the house up and changing it in fact i just bought a a large bird cage i had seen in magazines how they were decorating them that not that i want a bird i don't want a bird but i have decorated it up with flowers and i got a little nest in there that looks like it's got two little birds in there and i've got some dolls sitting in there it looks really really cute yeah my wife just remodeled since Christmas she's remodeled our bedroom with all new sheets comforters things like that and paint and she did a wallpaper border um-hum new drapes uh looks it's just a whole different different atmosphere in there looks kind of like i like to hang out in there now during the daytime um-hum um-hum yeah it's kind of fun to change too isn't it it's just yeah she picked a for the walls she picked a fudgesicle color fudgesicle color no yeah which well i thought well i don't know if this'll work but when she finished it really looked good yeah it probably goes with a lot of different colors too yeah i don't think she meant for it to go with anything other than just fudgesicle walls and the ends the white trim um-hum um just to give it a little bit different look than what it's always been or been lately anyway so um-hum um-hum well you are the first man that i've talked to really yeah um-hum  i uh spent four years as a university professor and yeah oh really i i've spent three years um teaching in public schools and elementary school oh do you really that's great uh-huh i taught in Utah and uh no kidding did you teach in California what i did i did um uh-huh you sound pretty young for a university professor well i was pretty young well i was uh i had never intended to do it and i was uh uh given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in in uh uh one of the business schools in the California State University system uh-huh at any rate um the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is um research the problem from the point of view of uh uh what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically you may be familiar with cooperative learning um-hum have you ever well you can you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in Utah well the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools and uh what what it involves basically is the use of peer groups and the uh teacher becomes a uh a sort of a consultant resource person uh-huh uh-huh to the cooperative learning uh to the learning cooperatives i guess they're called and there are uh some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people uh gain a competence with respect to the material uh-huh um i think that the combination of uh technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn uh i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system uh that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster uh school systems are in too many states dominated by administrators uh-huh yeah and uh both teachers and parents uh complain about the uh uh the cost and ineffectiveness that results so my feeling is that um true the the problem is is uh significant there are plenty of good people uh available to um offer people educational experience but that we just have to reallocate reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it and uh i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research um uh of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance particularly uh accelerate the the pace of learning um-hum um-hum and my feeling is that uh those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually i don't know what form it'll ultimately take um uh but i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for uh inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior so it must be the way we're managing the process that uh yeah i see what you're saying yeah i totally agree i i don't i don't think it's it's a matter of of uh talented people to do it as both as quote unquote students and as teachers but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities oh yeah in the past thirty years that weren't existent uh you must see kids with real significant problems um in some cases uh-huh uh course Iowa City i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in Iowa City is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or well i've i haven't taught in Iowa but i've taught in Utah and um people there were saying that the way that the schools were going a lot of people were going away and going to private schools or else going to home where they taught their kids at home right or you know anything but the public schools and the ones that did have you know the kids yeah well even in Utah well Utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe well uh maybe it was the area i was in but a lot of schools had lot of transient um families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side and yeah you see you saw a fair number of troubled kids yeah and i mean like you said how they were the schools were doing more things for the kids they thought than they were thirty years ago i mean they were the school i was teaching at the the year i left they're considering providing hot lunch for or hot breakfast for the kids yeah yeah as well as hot lunch and  what are your favorite TV shows um i guess one of my favorite ones is Cheers yeah i always liked that one they're always so funny and i also like The Cosby Show those are probably my two favorites yeah yeah yeah i i i rather enjoy the Cosby Show my wife and i both like Commish you know i've watched that one time and it was really good but now that's on what Saturday night uh it's either Friday night it's either tonight or tomorrow night um around here at least is it Saturday uh-huh i can't i can't remember i guess it depends on what channel you're getting you know what system you're getting it through uh-huh yeah i yeah i saw it one time and i really liked it but i just haven't uh seen it you know watched it since uh we we always enjoyed it it it seems to be kind of halfway between um something like All In The Family and uh Hill Street Blues yeah uh it's it's it's it's a good show yeah the episode that i watched um i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer you know sometimes the laws are kind of ridiculous and you need to sometimes break them to get your point across and for a good reason you tend yeah yeah and he seems to do that sometimes he he tenderhearted fellow yeah yeah i i guess that's what first drew us to him the uh the the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours uh-huh but uh yeah yeah i thought it was a pretty good show yeah um i also like i i like to watch like Sixty Minutes and Twenty Twenty yeah um i don't know we uh watch Commish any chance we get uh-huh um used to be a big fan of Star Trek but that's kind of they they it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against um anything spiritual uh-huh but uh anyway i've never gotten into the Star Trek era yeah i i used to be a used to be a real big fan of Star Trek used to be a Trekkie huh um pretty much yeah i always enjoyed the show anyway uh-huh yeah and Star Trek's in a set the uh Star Wars set uh-huh uh the one of the first Star Wars movie yeah i think i watched it something like nineteen times oh my goodness you must have some of the lines memorized uh i did at one time anyway wow oh a pretty big fan of that sort of thing used to used to read a read a lot of science fiction work too yeah uh-huh but uh no it um we don't do a whole lot of TV watching but that uh i don't know if you heard him or not they got a twelve year old twelve week old baby twelve week oh i was gonna say i hear a baby in the background uh-huh yeah that between that and school it's not between him and school there's not much time left for watching much TV i imagine that keeps you busy yeah well we're we're expecting our first in about three months so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now yeah this one here is our first and and we're both full time students so oh wow yeah that must be tough what are you hoping for a boy or a girl it doesn't matter just a healthy baby that that's that's the best way you you haven't found out yet or anything have you well we had a sonogram but we told him not to tell us so it's gonna be a surprise yeah that's the best way yeah i mean it's like finding out somewhere in July what you're gonna get for Christmas i mean you know it's it's it's not as much fun oh yeah it's it's not quite the same yeah i agree i'm sure we'll be watching more uh children oriented television shows anyway yeah oh i'm about half kid heart anyway oh i am too i still watch cartoons sometimes every once in a while when my sister comes to visit so i i well the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much but the uh well a couple of the uh ones Disney's doing aren't too bad but well you know it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be oh yeah you know i remember like the Flintstones and the Jetsons and those were just kind of good old cartoons yeah the the the worst of the violence in the Flintstones was when somebody gave Fred a poke in the snoot yeah but oh shoot i mean blowing up galaxies and and putting a curse on the whole planet or or or you know or on all the you know everything of this species you know just all kinds of crud yep yeah and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays yeah everything's mutations and and and killing and yeah um-hum gone are the days of those things they use what was it i uh uh TNT uh Turner Broadcasting Network used to used to uh do the Saturday morning and Sunday morning cartoons the old cartoons they used to put between the first and second feazure feature at the theatre uh-huh those old little ten minute jobs where the uh the real ballooned looking art work you know and and uh-huh  okay okay and you want to talk about this weather wow i wanna talk about how mild it was at Christmas time yeah it's something else yeah how about that huh well that was uh totally unbelievable for the first time in a long time i left plants outside and they didn't freeze so that was pretty good um yeah yes yeah that's true uh the i think it was last year around this time it was when we had the really really hardened cold snap yeah i had a pipe break on me so it flooded the house and everything oh you did oh that's terrible so i was trying to be prepared this time around well what'd you do to prepare for that uh well it was an outside pipe so now this time i made sure i wrapped them up real good um-hum i see oh you did oh good for you uh-huh i don't wanna go through that again no i um that happened to a friend of ours actually they have a condominium and um they they went out to the grocery store and were out for oh a couple of hours um-hum um-hum and when they came home the the pipe had broken and their their ground floor was flooded so uh it it's it's a major horror when when that kind of thing occurs ah um-hum yeah well with us we were out of town over the Christmas holiday and our neighbor called us to say hey you guys did you leave the water running oh oh oh no uh-huh yeah they saw the the water coming out from under the door oh my goodness isn't that terrible thing yeah yeah so we cut our vacation short but i guess it wasn't too bad uh we ended up getting all new carpet downstairs and part of the upstairs so oh um-hum yeah oh oh my goodness well it wasn't it wasn't a real pleasant but uh you know looking back it it was a good deal because we did need new carpet um-hum um-hum well you know sometimes in a funny kind of way life treats us like that that something we wouldn't normally do when we're placed in the circumstance we go ahead and do it and then uh things are kind of better afterwards and it it ultimately gives you an uplift i i i guess you have to look at it like that anyway or you might get depressed and God forbid but anyway yeah exactly um-hum that's true but uh we had visitors from New York i'm really not from this area you must detect that i'm really originally from the New York area and we had visitors uh both from New York and from California at Christmas time um-hum um-hum oh and um usually it is uh somewhat cold i mean cold enough to put on a winter coat or at least heavy sweaters and it was so mild here that uh they had to of course sure sure poke several funny jokes at us down here with this funny weather and you know whatever uh but uh i think they were very uh pleasantly happy because one person has um um-hum uh arthritis kind of stuff and um um-hum when it gets very cold they all crink up you know and uh we didn't have any of that kind of problem this year so we were uh very grateful for that kind of thing um-hum um-hum that's great yeah so you had the kind of weather that uh it was nice to go out at night on that's right um-hum yeah uh-huh of course in California they have such a steadily more moderate climate that the temperatures even in the areas around San Francisco we used to live yeah that's great um-hum down in that Bay area the temperatures never got excessively cold if it got down around thirty two just about um-hum um-hum uh then the people would start panicking over the artichoke uh crops and uh avocados and of course down south the hum oh i see um-hum the orange groves and things like that you know the weather really does have a lot of effect upon so many things and um when they grow those oranges down in the southlands they have these right yeah braziers out in the field and they go around putting fires on if the temperatures gets down around thirty two or thirty and just levels off there so that um-hum hum wow they can regulate it by means of those like man made not too difficult um uh ways to to save the crops um-hum yeah but we all know what happens if those crops freeze uh we pay for it yeah right right that's right you know uh you you usually don't think of that uh you know being i guess being in a urban area if it gets cold you know yeah um-hum uh-huh you you well let's think about water freezing and pipes breaking but down there they got all those crops to worry about right of course uh-huh oh oh yes oh it's it's really well that happened here in Texas with the grapefruits that year a couple of years ago yeah yeah right i remember that and the grapefruit crop was very uh very scarce uh so uh you know all of these major things the poor farmers but um that's right right yeah anyway we'll just uh hope that uh we're not in for too many big freezes now but i know one big one will come and in it always does and uh i really don't mind those uh few uh snow flurries and those few days when there's a bit of snow it always happens huh always happens huh sure i'd say there's pretty quite pretty  uh so what do you like best about golf i like to watch golf my husband plays golf and i've i've really become fairly acquainted with the game it's pretty interesting to watch i think my favorite part of the game is the putting part really really uh-huh do you play yeah i play uh i play probably four or five times a week my my wife and kids oh my don't like it too much but well i've already it's such a great game i i i play three you know thirty six holes after work good heavens and then uh it must stay light out there pretty well yeah it does in the summertime in the winter it's too you know but uh you know i go to the indoor driving range all all winter and uh in the summer well yeah in the summer uh-huh um-hum and uh i practice putting and it's it's a fun game there's a place here in Dallas it's called Dave and Buster's oh really and they have a laser well it's like lasers golf game where there's three beams and you take your clubs and you hit the ball and they give you a screen of what you would be seeing from where you lie that sounds great it's really a lot of fun and it's it's fairly comparable to some of the nicer golf courses around here the nicer public courses the price of it is if you're ever in Dallas you'd have to go to Dave and Buster's well i have to do that because i love golf and it is a very fine game i think it teaches a lot of good uh a lot of good uh attributes well to people Cathy is that your name Cathy um yeah you got it right do you do you uh do you have a favorite golfer do i have a favorite golfer professional golfer excuse me my wife is making fun of me oh talking about golf on the T I thing yeah she hates it when i you know she thinks it's funny that i got golf as a topic because you know she dislikes it so much so uh when you start up on golf well you probably picked it though on your list of of topics to speak about yeah um i would say that my favorite golfer is Greg Norman Greg Norman why there's just something about the way he plays golf he just approaches the ball so confidently and the way he hits he's just really he's got kind of a funny swing but beyond that he's really he seems a very confident player and he does he does play fairly well what about yourself are you sure you're not attracted to him or anything well that may be too he's he's not the most attractive guy on the on the tour i'll say that but uh i guess after watching for so long for so long i've been i've been watching and hearing about golf from my husband for six years six and a half years or a little more uh-huh and after a while you get to where yeah you start watching who plays well and who doesn't i think Tom Kite is another good player yeah yeah i like Tom he's good he's got a real ugly stance but yeah i'll agree with you there Cathy he does he he does play real well and he he seems to almost always win yeah he does so he's so that's got to say a lot for him right there that he just wins quite often what about yourself who is your favorite player uh i'd have to say uh i i still like the Golden Bear you know even on the even on the senior tour oh yeah i i like the senior tour i i think it's got more personality well yeah well the guys have you know and the names don't change every week you know the there's one thing that's true yeah you can always count on Lee and Chichi and Don January and so sure and uh oh yeah the Golden Bear out there hitting them up sure really putting them in my kids do you have kids Cathy uh-huh yeah i have a young boy i'm starting them off young i'm gonna get them oh you got a boy good uh-huh oh he already plays golf he's not eighteen months and he golfs around the house he does has he got a pretty good stance uh-huh no he's horrible but but he loves huh to he's got a a set of three little plastic clubs and little plastic balls and he takes his club and he whacks the ball around the house and he whacks the cat and then he'll get a big play ball and bounce it around with his club oh but he really enjoys taking them out and he likes to watch his daddy practice swing and putt around the house so huh yeah i'm i'm already a golf widow and i don't mind it i mean i know where my husband is when he's out well that's true and he's in a very wholesome environment while he's out there so that's true he's out getting some sunshine anyway yeah it's  well i suppose we both have credit cards um-hum yeah they seem to be a part of life yeah yeah how do you use them well i do use them um um-hum i have a few favorites that i use more than others and uh i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable i i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to um-hum um but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when when you start using more than a few and uh um-hum they all can build up um-hum uh i think they're handy i just get uh i don't carry a lot of cash with me and uh i hate writing checks um-hum yeah when you go shopping um-hum well do you use credit cards yeah i use a few i um i watched my grandmother go into debt on them and so i've and then i guess my mother yeah so my mother learned from that and i guess she taught me to be very very careful with them so um-hum your grandmother huh basically um i just keep them i use them so that i build up a credit rating you know but otherwise um um-hum i generally and my husband it turns out i've just been married seven months but he has the same habit and we just keep a few you know few of the major ones and then use them once in a while for something but we always pay it off right that month that's good oh that's that's wonderful so that way we keep any service charge so that way we keep out of debt and we keep on top of what we're spending well the interest rates in credit cards is so high now compared to what you're savings is bringing it's really i guess ridiculous to let them keep building yeah yeah yeah that's what i feel but i know some people can get get you know carried away with them and let them get out of hand so um-hum it's really easy just to forget you know that you you charged that or charged that i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come but sometimes i forget and so you know a bill will come in and i'll think oh no i didn't know it was going to be that high but so far i've been able to we've been able to pay it off every time so um-hum um yeah well that's good i'm looking right now i'm kind kind of looking for a Visa that has a lower interest rate it seems that some of them have gotten higher uh-huh and uh i saw on TV they had a program on uh credit cards and they're supposed to i don't know if it was Tennessee or Arkansas or some some other state had a Visa card that was the lowest one in the country and i didn't write it down at the time and then i went and looked and to see what my Visa was and i think it's eighteen percent or something so um-hum um think i want to find something that has a lower rate yeah have you ever used Discover card no i haven't yeah i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off but you know is is that the one from Sears um i think Sears originally put it out but it's um it's pretty well taken all over the US now i mean uh i've haven't found many places that don't take Discover okay and there's no annual service fee which is good you know and then um okay they also give you they say cash back um like at the end of the year for the amount that i charge i get two dollars back or something but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back uh-huh oh oh they give you money back for using your credit card yeah basically that's it yeah basically that's it and i think the service charge is pretty low too but i'm not sure oh i didn't know that hum well you know Sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards uh-huh i worked with at Sears for over ten years and uh it was only a Sears card that they would take uh-huh until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so um-hum you know now they'll take the Discover but i still don't know if Sears will take Visa or MasterCard um-hum but uh i never did apply for a Discover card i just figure with the Visa and yeah um-hum American Express i probably have an i can do enough damage with those two yeah i think it's best to keep the number down that you have um-hum yeah i've got some that i you know i haven't even used at all uh past few years i probably wouldn't be able to use them so um-hum but uh i i do like my Dillard's i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop uh-huh and i do do use Dillard's probably as more than any of the other department stores um-hum but yeah well do you have anything else to say or well yes no not too much more about credit cards okay i don't think i do either so well it was good talking to you okay well good talking to you Beth okay have a good evening bye-bye good luck you too bye  so what do you think about the uh income taxes well i could do with a lot less than that where do you live i live in Dallas okay i live in Dallas too oh good well i live in Plano in that case okay i live in uh in the Village do you know where that is i oh yeah i do yeah yeah well one thing i can tell you i hate about the taxes in Dallas is the eight and a quarter percent sales tax yes it i think it's like the highest in the US because my sister lived in New York and it was only seven percent there uh-huh Washington DC was only six percent and where i moved from Virginia was only four and a half percent and i can tell you we were upset when it went to four and a half i know it was only four percent and you know we had no sales tax here about oh i don't know maybe ten years ago we had none at all and that's how it started with uh four percent five percent really um-hum um-hum and all of a sudden here we are now and it's horrible what since there's no uh state tax i assume that that's why it went up fast because Virginia does have a state tax well it's true but they did without it all those years um-hum hm and they keep talking about the state tax and they'll probably put one in and they'll have this too so yeah it if they put state tax in i mean i'll be pretty upset yeah because i mean part of the reason part of the incentives of moving to Texas from Virginia was the fact that you have no state tax and basically it adds about sixty dollars to your paycheck uh-huh uh every two weeks and uh if that comes back in yeah i'll be pretty mad because sixty dollars a paycheck is a lot of money actually you know yeah so uh i don't know i'm not very much for a for state tax well i hope it doesn't but you know how it goes so yeah they keep talking about uh you know the light rail system adding taxes uh-huh and then uh there was another issue that came up i forget uh the horse racing yeah they're putting up the the racing fees they said they may raise taxes because of that yeah they said uh to build okay raise them apparently they said the builders would provide thirty million dollars in funds and the state would need to provide sixty five million dollars in funds oh well in order to get the sixty five million dollars it would cause an increase in taxes but it seems like it would pay itself off oh well it will so you know what's the purpose of the increasing the sales tax you know probably the first season yeah so you know but they're funny about things like that here yeah things like that you know they really are when i came here you couldn't buy beer couldn't buy a drink nothing was open on Sunday not even a grocery store i mean nothing nothing you know um-hum no huh so it was a lot worse and as more people come in it does get better but they still have some real funny laws um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the US and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe yeah yeah but uh like sales tax and i where i lived in uh in Virginia they had personal property tax in the counties uh-huh and that was a lot my parents paid almost four thousand dollars a year in personal property tax on the house they paid almost a thousand dollars on uh oh that is on two of our cars and they paid like a couple hundred dollars on the other cars but the personal property tax itself used to add up oh you know just i mean itself would probably add up to seven or eight thousand dollars a year hm yeah and that's a lot of money you know most places go ahead and just you know put it into your mortgage payment so you don't forget about it at the last minute you know and have to come up with the funds at the end of the year that is yeah hm but that gets real expensive oh yeah that is do they have that kind of tax down here on the houses at all do you know uh uh they well they do a little bit but um it's it's like next to nothing i've seen it it's on my when you pay your registration and stuff like that there is a little place um um-hum well you know like every year they renew the registration here kind of like fifty or sixty bucks uh-huh it costs what so it's only like fifty or sixty bucks to renew your registration here but in Virginia they won't renew your registration till you pay your property personal property tax yeah yeah uh-huh and i had a i i paid you know twelve hundred dollars a year for my last car really for personal property tax alone so that was kind of a relief i guess God that's not too bad but other than that everything worked out yeah so you haven't been here very long what's that you haven't been here very long i've been here about two years now two years but uh in the two years i've i've been here i've been through i've had two cars um-hum so i've never really like you know i don't know if they if they ever will assess a personal uh any kind of tax uh yeah on the car other than what i paid when i registered uh registered the car yeah so that's the only thing i can really think of so so do you work for TI or you just doing this no i don't i'm a nurse i work down at Presbyterian okay yeah someone just mentioned this program to me so i thought it'd be kind of cool yeah oh it is you know they're supposed to cut you off at ten calls at least that's what i heard that you could could get to do ten calls oh do they really yeah i i don't know how the thing works uh and this is like the seventeenth oh really all right you yeah so it's great  okay uh personal computer i don't have a personal computer i'd like to have one if i had more money i'd have one uh-huh i've got one i do have one but it's a kind of an old one that uh they didn't use at work any longer it's not the not the greatest one but uh i use one at work quite a bit all day long in fact um-hum is it is it hard to find uh compatible pieces for your the one you have at home yeah because it's a little bit older and uh it's a it's a Wang machine and Wang was you know a leader a while ago but now they're kind of out of it yeah oh yeah um i would think that would be the hardest part about having a home computer is the it seems like every month they're coming out with something new and so then you're not compatible oh yeah what's that oh yeah constantly constantly changing uh even with like the computer games Nintendo and that kind of stuff i mean they change it every year and the the previous game or the previous program or whatever isn't compatible uh-huh yeah most of the uh you know WordPerfect and Lotus and those kinds of programs you can subscribe to an update service for about fifty dollars a year i think they'll give you the the next release of their software oh oh okay and but uh well that isn't that doesn't sound too bad yeah do you use one much um not really not in my work um i did try and take a class um i think last was it last spring uh-huh uh-huh no actually it was last fall it was at at i took desktop publishing i just wanted to get sort of a a slight feel for it and it was just an introduction course oh uh-huh sure uh-huh and it was pretty fascinating we we learned how to do how to make a brochure type thing out out off off the computer so it was pretty interesting oh uh-huh yeah oh i'm a CPA and i use it almost all the time for this Lotus program i'll have well lot of good applications for what i have to do oh so you've yeah uh-huh yeah now the Lotus is for mostly numbers and graphs and things like that right yeah yeah or uh spreadsheets and that type of thing yeah it's i'm not real good with computers at all and that's mainly because i don't use them i wish i did i'd be you know huh yeah more up on it well they they've sure come down in price uh in your you know four or five years ago they were probably four or five times what they are now oh my goodness yes yeah have you heard about the phone that uh believe it's AT and T uh is it AT and T that's coming out with the phone with the like on the Jetsons when you could see the you could see the person's face oh yeah uh-huh when you have a vision with the sound uh-huh have you seen that yeah yeah yeah i saw that in a in a magazine recently i was really shocked yeah i'm not sure i'd like that once you get those calls early in the morning when you're just out of bed oh i know hopefully you can decide if you wanna have a picture or not yeah have control over whether they can see you or not but it looked pretty nice and it's only gonna be two thousand dollars so which is not bad for something new like that so oh really yeah uh-huh well you know they've got these uh all these modems uh computers have modems in them now where you can call all over the face uh um-hum yeah i can do a fair amount of work from home and tap into our company's main computer system without much trouble oh my mother does a lot of work on computers and she taps into computers all over the world she works at at she works at TI and uh uh-huh this is uh how you got signed up for it uh-huh yeah uh-huh and uh you know she talks to people through the computer from everywhere so i think i think that's really neat too yeah yeah well i have a sister lives in Plano that's my connection with the project okay uh-huh maybe she knows my mother because my mother used to work in Plano now she works in uh north Dallas i think so oh uh-huh yeah but but i you know there are i've got a six year old and i think he's he's got quite a bit of interest in uh in playing around with the one we have at home and it's not a it's not a real fun one it's not a color or i don't have much in the way of game software uh-huh i visited with some kids in elementary school and nowadays a lot of the schools have computers and the kids are really they're more interested in their schoolwork yeah with the computer you know they can also play games but then they can help them write papers and helps with their math and that kind of thing yeah i think it yeah you know adds a dimension that uh probably makes learning a little bit more fun if you get to you know oh yeah try things a little different than just the standard pencil and paper and crayons and there's always something new even if you know even if you think you know everything about the computer there's always one button that you never quite use and you don't really know what it's for and you know it can be fascinating in that way too especially for a kid that you know is just learning so yeah um-hum yeah well hopefully i'll be able to get a computer at some point i don't know when but i don't need one right now yeah but there's gonna come a time i'm sure when everybody's gonna have to have one oh i think that day'll happen i'm hoping and perhaps uh what'll ultimately happen is you won't have to commute as much but you'll be able to do so much from home oh yeah um-hum yeah that uh you know you won't have to be driving around like  yeah as far as i'm concerned and probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching uh Reasonable Doubts which had a you know capital case in it uh-huh and uh my i personally have uh my own feelings about uh the capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony i do too mandatory i mean summary execution on the steps that day um-hum why is it you know i i'm i'm in that same i think if it's uh if it's a convicted if it's a convicted uh felon on parole um-hum uh and he goes out and and commits another crime or kills somebody i you know i i feel the same way i don't think i think that person is is beyond uh rehabilitation and and he should be taken out well i i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation uh-huh but i do know that some people almost all people usually die before that point um-hum they just get too old um-hum um as far as capital punishment on on it's own merits i have the trouble with the way it's applied i think it should be applied on a little bit more fair manner uh and i've i've said this very often and i believe it to be the a a very true axiom so i would be rather be white rich and guilty than black and innocent uh-huh because if you're if you're black and you kill a white guy you're going to fry period they will kill you right yeah if you're black and you kill a black guy you know it's you know two hundred hours of community service yeah you don't hear you don't hear too much of that of those cases yeah well it's a social disease that we have called one upsmanship yeah you know we're the majority so we can do whatever the hell we wanna do yeah that's right and you're the minority and you're stuck with it but uh huh you know we had this in the Vietnam war you know we had you know population of blacks among military people in Vietnam was about eighty percent right but the population of blacks in the military was about twenty two percent huh the handwriting's on the wall there isn't it yep it sure is you know but that's another issue altogether yeah it's as as far as capital punishment i think that uh ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment i think the guy should have ninety days and if he can't produce evidence not argument but evidence um-hum see the only thing i don't you know i don't understand i guess i i don't understand our judicial system uh as it is right now because i you know if somebody has been convicted and has been sentenced to be put to death how is it that they can appeal and appeal and appeal and get stays of execution execution i mean how you know is there well that that goes back to when uh America was a a colony of England um-hum in England you went to court you were assumed guilty until proven innocent and once they found you guilty you know the judge said he's guilty kill him well there there were some people that uh had a problem with that uh-huh because they found out later on that jeez you know a guy will lie rather than get killed and he'll say you know hey that guy did it you know not me right yeah and uh or he'll have somebody lie for him you know people lie it's a strange thing but they do that yeah and to prevent that kind of misuse of power they wrote into the Constitution a protection against judicial mishap um-hum hm and the judicial mishap in this event would be hey you got the wrong guy look at that guy uh at E Systems yep they were going to they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit yeah he was too far away when it happened he had witnesses that were you know they weren't dope dealers they weren't drug fiends they were employees of a an establishment that had a very high level of security sensitivity and these were really responsible people hm you know and they convicted this guy because somebody says well he looks like the right guy you know they all look the same to me you know yeah big lips flat nose yep that was him yep what do you think about um uh convicted um  school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or no i don't no no huh not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself no uh not a lot i've got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh um-hum and do you have any children i i have a daughter that's only eighteen months though so we haven't got exposed too much to that but uh-huh yeah you can sure see where it seems like uh there's a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i i kind of wonder i don't know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what yeah yeah i think it's probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than it's realistic that that the school system can provide um-hum for them to get uh-huh and in conjunction a lot of um school districts' funds have been cut because of at least in California that's the case it's probably the case elsewhere too sure yeah well they've been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff there's not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell there's only so many in hours a day i don't even know if it's just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it it's a matter of um-hum well it's kind of a philosophical philosophical expectation about who's responsible for discipline you know it's oh you know i think that's a good point it's really a good point it you know you you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and uh-huh in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for what's important in terms of values and i think that's probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess uh-huh yeah i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be um-hum yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine o'clock at the very latest whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and you're you know you're right in saying you don't see a lot of that there's out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that um-hum um-hum maybe TV's a bigger um yeah TV and Nintendo competitor for their time yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh and when we were kids yeah that's true i know you know i didn't appreciate i i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didn't really learn how to study that much until i hit college um-hum but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you don't you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so yeah that's a good point just learning the discipline to to to study yeah to sit and study and i don't know it's it's you know i only have the the one daughter and she's quite young but it makes you a little nervous to know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them but um-hum um-hum well probably having gone through that experience you'll be likely to want to speak speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home um-hum um-hum do you have any children at all or our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are oh yeah same boat yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or well you know we're coming up on the time she's probably going to be ready for she's in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um uh-huh uh-huh i think she'll probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco in our neighborhood there's actually a good public schools at the elementary grade there's not a really decent middle school or high school i'm not sure we'll be in the same area when she's that old but um um-hum um-hum i have to really do the research to find out whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that yeah it's really the the expense is a real issue when you think about yeah that's true that's true yeah i i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh um-hum um-hum sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high school or well i don't know how it is in your community i know that um or not in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually it's not so much in the city actually it's outside more in the east Oakland or east bay um-hum um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents don't feel that they're getting getting what they want in the public schools so they're almost like public um-hum  hello okay so you were with TI huh yeah i've been with i was with uh TI for uh thirty four years so obviously i found something worth worth doing there and have prejudices about uh what i want well any stay any place that long they got to be doing something right right yeah uh where do you work i uh work for myself i sell uh metal fabricating equipment and tooling and uh uh oh CAD CAM systems and things like that and uh consequently i can't really discuss big time benefits at the moment although i had worked for Univac and Pitney Bowes and some big companies once upon a time and uh i think most people don't necessarily realize the cost of them and they're somewhat probably getting out of hand oh yeah they uh i'm not sure what the category's supposed to be uh but it was what something about what benefits would you consider something like that when you uh go to work for a large company well uh i think uh oh the way i got other other than salary didn't it say yeah right well no it didn't necessarily say other than salary but what would you consider to be kind of important i guess well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah such as well i i imagine that's what they're referring to you know like uh your health insurance and pensions and all that kind of good stuff uh yeah yeah well i uh personally i left my previous job which was with Chance-Vought before i joined uh there and ironically i left Chance-Vought the largest employer in Dallas County at that time with some thirty thousand people as i recall and uh joined a little firm of Texas Instruments because i wanted to go with a small company and they grew up around you didn't it and uh that was twenty five hundred people when i joined and uh uh-huh then it became Dallas County's largest employer oh yeah but uh one reason i left where i was it definitely had to do with what i wanted uh besides what i was getting and it had to do with uh wanting to do research and in other words i wanted to enjoy the job and have the freedom to do the job well i think that's one of the keys that most people uh probably put above benefits that's why i work for myself basically too i want to do what i wanna do yeah well i participated on many uh surveys and that sort of thing i was a TI fellow so i was down on you know on the technical ladder side rather than the uh um-hum heavy management although i was a branch manager at one time and it's amazing that managers in general just would not believe the survey results because to them uh money is the motivation and uh benefits you know stock options uh perks that sort of thing right right and power and they they just couldn't understand why with the technical surveys that were done by the uh Institute of Electrical Engineers and uh others uh including IBM's that in the technical community salary was never first it was usually about third and yeah well i think as long as it's comparable with you know the job or can right that uh you aren't being picked on in the sense of being the whipping boy dollar wise in the corporation you you know you know you got to i right number one and number two usually were uh number one was usually uh enjoyable work or work that i enjoy something of that sort uh and number two was freedom to do that work normally and uh third or even fourth sometimes was the salary yes yes and that was in virtually every technical uh ladder survey that was taken over the well oh fifteen or so years that i participated but invariably the managers would challenge this you know because because they just couldn't believe that that people weren't motivated by money right well i i wouldn't say they aren't motivated by money but i would say that there are other things that are equal or greater important i i guess if you make enough money uh if the money were really big bucks i guess some of these other things you could uh yeah well i'm sure you know if you were being paid a slave labor scale obviously money would be high up on the list but live with for a while anyway until you had enough to do what you wanted to do but yes in a competitive uh market as it was most of the time when i was in where you could get you could get a job elsewhere anytime any day of the week you wanted to go until about the last two years and uh right in that case you felt more secure uh money wise so that you could seek uh enjoyable work or creative work that sort of thing right  so how's your lawn and garden work well today it's uh we're not doing much with it because it's kind of raining outside but or snowing actually uh yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet but um actually my husband is in the other room um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um oh is he okay yeah do you do a lot of lawn work not so much anymore i'm i'm getting older i'm fifty two now so i've just uh i've sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay jype of job um-hum but uh and i've let this little kid that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit this past year i think i'm gonna let him do it all this year just i work uh i'm out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like every Friday that's what i have to face on Saturday is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that well there was a time when my husband had had had traveled a lot and um so we had a service for the first year that we were in our house and the lawn looked great um now that that he's home we don't um right we haven't been treating it as well you know using fertilizer and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay it's just that we don't we still have a problem with weeds oh i understand yeah we yeah we have a problem about every other year with weeds it it appears that every other year a service can get rid of them and uh but just just about every other year they come back and i think maybe they uh spread some because they're putting it down it's a constant battle i tell you but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and we're not real naturalists or anything but um right what we have heard is that the amount of fertilizer that we put on our lawns is about the same amount that a farmer would put on a whole entire crop i understand and uh i have a cold so i'm having a hard time i do too so i'm have the same problem um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i don't really know what it involves or um um right at this point in time i enjoyed having the service when we did um the only problem was they never told us when they were coming and then you find a note on your door that says water within two to three days and it was never uh right right but uh right right with a thirty five dollar bill well well we didn't use one year before last a service because we we had weeds like two years in a row and you know when you when you have a service you don't expect that so we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer i'd went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job what service did you use Lawn Doctor Lawn Doctor and we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one that's more local hm one of our friends bought the one in Plano they just didn't uh didn't do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard right and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because we've got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda what's not weeds right and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter right either rye or something yeah something like that it's real clumpy and yeah you can see i have we have a lot of trees in our yard so it's a it's you know during the summer it's bare under the trees so i've pratted a lot planted a lot of rye winter rye to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees it's more of a shade it's a better shade grass so now as as cold as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as it's in the summer because that's that's the only green area in our lawn yeah oh do you do you ever do you ever double sod or um whatever all of our Bermuda's all brown we have on the side yard few years back right you know where they mix the seed i'm always uh you know sometimes i'm sometimes i'm i'm over at Home Depot i'll just a grab a grass a thing of of grass seed and put it in the old spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the Bermuda grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the weeds and everything so yeah yeah i think that's our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the grass grass growing rather than the weeds so i just right how about how about flowers you have you have nice flowers in your front yard um in the front yard not so much we have a lot  and i have to admit that we just moved to Plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet and although i did go down and register and i that's the first time i've ever done that has what's been your voting experience my voting experience well do you feel like uh i mean i i i well personally i've been very diligent until recent years um-hum uh-huh when i felt my vote was absolutely kind of washed down the drain yes for the issues that you know that i felt really strong for um i think apathy has set in to a lot of people because of the way our politicians are and the way our country is being run um-hum that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates course we only have mostly the representation given in the media but um i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known what the issues were and that i because it was a new community you really do have to study to get yourself um up to par with what is truly going on and that takes a lot of research and and people today are very busy um-hum it does and uh and that is an excuse because we are we are always uh involved i know i'm heavenly involved in other things yeah um-hum and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that um-hum no and uh you hopefully will find that you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard and unfortunately they are not um-hum no and uh it's really a dilemma uh that we find ourselves in i believe um right so i kind of just have taken a back step away and uh hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there um-hum take it it because it is a task that is to me kind of overwhelming yes and uh and uh i also feel especially in the presidential elections that uh since we're back on the old system of electoral votes and or that and that you don't necessarily your vote doesn't necessarily elect a president right they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes right and it's kind of it's awful and and it's hard to feel like one person but i know that it's important yeah and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here haven't taken the time and i know that you know people can make a difference but it's hard to to face the corruption like you say and uh and to know what you're up against and it makes me feel bad that i'm glad i mean i am thankful for the uh nineteenth amendment that it gives women the right to vote and uh i'm glad that that happened yes and everything and i hope that i will become a better make a better difference in but i haven't done that so far well i know that when you're in a smaller community i live in Mesquite and uh um-hum when we have uh a local election say for our mayor and so forth um-hum they really uh give a lot of information in the local newspaper not in the not in the bigger city Dallas newspaper i mean they they just give it a small portion of the newspaper but the local newspaper really goes into uh quite a bit of history about the candidate um-hum and uh and then they have they raise a they raise two sides and uh there's a pro and a con side and uh you can really um um-hum feel comfortable in uh evaluating that uh candidate by uh that method um-hum uh i feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth now i wouldn't say that about the larger cities though and the and the country uh like the presidential um-hum right uh i mean they've got people that are running that are admitted uh criminals and admitted crooks you know i'm sorry but right right i don't believe in them turning a good uh uh a new leaf um-hum unless they have the Lord that has done that to them right and uh without the Lord they can't do it yeah and it's not very likely i mean it seems like their  think of the job benefits you have well i i think uh so far they've been pretty pretty good except the medical uh not not the medical the dental insurance the dental insurance yeah i yeah i think um um do you work for TI okay hum i know i went to have a tooth pulled um-hum and uh it the cavity had gotten really bad and they they wouldn't uh cover it because they said it it was a pre existing condition hum you know how you wait you wait as long as you can yeah sometimes to to lose a tooth and then to for them to come up with something like that it i i just thought that was that was pretty bad uh-huh hm that does sound pretty bogus and then one time i had a tooth capped you know one of my caps fell fell off and uh um-hum uh-huh they paid for the the cap but they wouldn't pay for the build up hm that sounds kind of strange and i didn't understand that either who's your who's your dental care through uh well uh it's it's a part of Aetna uh-huh um ours is through uh Cigna um-hum and it's not too bad i mean i haven't i haven't been to the dentist a whole lot except for like just regular visits yeah and uh they haven't been bad they haven't uh they've been pretty good how about your uh do you have an HMO or well i had an HMO up to this year i switched you you went to like a regular plan yeah i went to regular Aetna uh i thought that the HMO was really great uh oh okay um-hum you know because did it get expensive or yeah it's gotten expensive because right now i'm i'm only i only have myself so i don't have to pay anything for Aetna the Kaiser uh premium got a little higher than it you know um-hum um-hum um-hum i have i have Kaiser right now and uh i think uh i personally i i think HMO's are scammy now just because uh it's only five dollars a visit every time i go that's not bad okay and it's five dollars prescription um-hum really um-hum right every time i go and they give you the generic stuff anyway right but uh every time i go there you got to pay three dollars for parking right you know and so if i go to make a like i i called in one time i wanted to see a doctor about my backache i someone had just hit me and uh and i you know i had some muscle stiffness i wanted to go get some uh some some medication show my back to a doctor um-hum um-hum and they wouldn't let me see a doctor they said no you know uh just just uh take some Ibuprofen and put a pillow on your back you know and i'm yeah yeah that was a problem that i had with them toward the end of the year i was i was really in a lot of pain and i went there and um-hum um-hum and uh they they gave me an appointment for about a month away um-hum and so i went to the health food store and got some teas and stuff and started drinking them i got okay but uh and i didn't go back um-hum well i was just really annoyed with them because i uh i i tried profusely to get an appointment uh to see you know and i said i if you don't give me an appointment i'm just gonna go to an emergency visit to emergency room and and send you guys the bill um-hum yeah that's what i thought about later i would've probably uh been better off if i just went to emergency and you just bill um-hum um-hum and and that's that's the only way you're going to get any action out of them you know if you threaten them with that you know because i said i just had the accident and i don't wanna wait too long um-hum yeah right before anything happens they're like well wait another day and call us back and i'm like i don't wanna wait another day i want an appointment now yeah yeah after i really thought about it some more the i i really could've done that but um um-hum i was hospitalized uh uh about three years ago i had some surgery um-hum um-hum and Kaiser was really good for that because i didn't have to pay any of it at all yeah it's it's real handy once you're you know if you like my roommate broke his arm um-hum and he went to the hospital he went in to the emergency room and they took care of his arm and he every time he went to one he only had to pay five dollars and he probably went through you know quite a bit of care uh the medicine was expensive the cast was expensive the stitches were expensive and all that um-hum um-hum and uh you know it it was real cheap i mean once you have a condition and you go to the hospital it probably works out real uh but for just like i don't know i'm i'm only twenty four years old you know i don't really get sick a lot you know i in fact uh over the last two years i've only gone to see the doctor once and that was for a physical um-hum yeah so you know for me you know i don't i don't see the doctor a whole hell of a lot you know yeah so but then again you know the year before that i when i had the regular plan you know you have a hundred dollar deductible um-hum well i went to the doctor once and it cost me ninety bucks so it was like oh well wow i guess i could've done pretty good with the five dollar visit yeah so well my uh my Kaiser premium would cost me like forty something dollars a month starting this year wow that's a lot and TI will cover uh whatever they would have covered for Aetna but the premium is still forty dollars more than that um-hum hum yeah Kaiser's expensive i mean i think it's uh this year it's like almost four thousand eight hundred dollars yeah so i went back to Aetna because i i won't hav e to pay anything yeah that works that works out pretty handy and uh although they do have a deductible that forty dollars a month will add up to that pretty quick uh-huh no yeah you know it works out okay i think if you have kids though the HMO is probably the best um-hum  have a favorite for the Super Bowl or i guess being as all the rest the teams are eliminated that's about all we can talk about yeah right uh well i i think um uh oh i probably um i don't know watching my son's a big fan of uh of Washington uh-huh and so uh for not not having any other real real preference i guess yes go for that well that's who i kind of thought uh that's who i was gonna kind of cheer for i just yeah think all the teams from the AFC are more or less like the minor leagues for the NFC lately so huh i just i hope they can give them a game i think it'll be a good game this year but i don't know in the past they haven't been so hot yeah yeah it's kind of kind of bad when they get blown out like do you uh yeah gets you know you you watch the Super Bowl for the commercials and that's about it all the new ones that come out so yeah just out of curiosity what uh people up in Utah um who who do who do people generally cheer for who are who are the close teams out there the California teams well i i think a lot of them uh uh kind of like me i i cheer i like players you know certain players and so i root for those teams and Brigham Young University of course is pretty big up here um-hum um-hum sure and so a lot of people like the 49ers because Steve Young plays for them uh Jim McMahon plays for the Chicago Bears so they cheered for him you know when he played for them but he kind of got to be a jerk so nobody liked him anyway but uh-huh right uh a lot of 49ers i think uh more than anything i guess but uh uh-huh hm yeah i mean in in Texas there's there's plenty you know there's a fair amount to choose from between the Cowboys and and the Oilers and so yeah yep but yeah we i i've always been kind of a Cowboys fan i like them i'm glad to see they're doing a little bit better but i see i just usually root for players that i know of i guess and whatever happens happens so yeah well um-hum used to be the Cowboys i mean the Cowboys for for for so many years uh ended up essentially dominating or and and being so strong consistently and then the last few years being being just walked all over by everybody i mean they've they've lost a lot of fans oh yeah oh oh yeah well i think i think you'll see i bet in the nineties they come out and i'll bet they're the team to beat is i mean they got so many first and second round picks again this year that i think they're gonna be really tough and Jimmy Johnson i yeah yeah sure yeah they're they're obviously rebuilding quite pretty well and and stuff oh yeah that Jimmy Johnson seems to know what he's doing too are you yeah i i didn't know how he was gonna make the transition into professional ball um um-hum you know it's one thing to be a real successful college coach now i i at least i imagine it is um you know and and then um-hum it seem like it would be quite different to to be coaching pros oh yeah well you'd think that the just the personalities the people it it it would seem a lot harder to get them motivated i mean it's a job then and you know you're not out for school spirit or whatever you know you're out for the fifty grand yeah yeah course course also at that at that level i mean you're dealing with people who who who know you know who who are competitive obviously or they wouldn't be there and they're motivated obviously or they wouldn't be there you know yeah that's true yeah that's true i guess and so uh you know i don't know i mean but it seems like it would you know you can't treat them like they're kids and yet in a lot of senses still a lot of them probably are course i've always had a hard time screaming at somebody that was about six five and two fifty anyway so i always thought that was kind of stupid wouldn't yell too loud at them because you never know what might come back at you yeah you would've you would've been one of those coaches with the soft styles yeah that's right just sweet talk them as much as you can because my yeah my dad was actually a football coach so yeah in the junior junior college yeah oh was he on a college level or junior college oh so did you play at all yourself or i played played high school but i didn't didn't go beyond that uh-huh yeah i stopped growing i think about when i was twelve years old and everybody else grew up so i quit after Little League because i realized it was yeah huh i was gonna get pounded on if i kept going so uh well i'm i didn't grow too big myself but yep but do you follow college much at all either or a little bit more so yeah because i i'm here in Austin and we have uh UT Austin it's here and and uh do you uh-huh you know they they look like they were big you know they're kind of like the Cowboys i mean for years years had a dominating team then they went through this big long slump and and uh last year it looked like they were back and and there was predictions that they were gonna be a yeah you know it'll be real challenge in fact i think they started ranks like you know fifteenth in the polls or something and then you know then it was a long slide down it really was it a fairly disappointing year uh-huh oh really yeah well i you know what they're i mean football in Texas that's pretty uh it's uh like a rabid thing down there isn't it it yeah it's it's pretty serious uh you know i i end up being so busy that i i don't watch much of it and and i don't follow it much but it's obvious that the people around me do um-hum yeah you know and and i sometimes feel bad that i haven't you know i'm not up on it more yeah in fact that's that was our whole reason for cheering this year because that uh Ty Detmer was from Texas down there and that's that's who i follow quite a bit is BYU but right uh-huh and so we were kind of prejudiced towards him good or bad or whatever anybody thinks but yeah they seem that he just from what he was saying his dad was a coach his brother was into it i mean that just seemed like a lot of people were involved kind of like Indiana and basketball or something yeah yeah right and and supposedly uh uh his brother his younger brother is graduating supposedly his younger brother is supposed to be a lot better than he is yeah oh really that'll be interesting see i know uh he's he been recruited pretty heavily he's not sure if he wants to f ollow in his brother's footsteps and go to the Y i wouldn't do it if i were him yeah no i don't know Texas yeah boy if he doesn't live up to that at least his brother's expectations  oh so what would be the your favorite meal to cook none to cook i don't like to cook spaghetti i guess though i make a mean spaghetti don't like to cook huh make a mean spaghetti huh yeah uh got kids married married no huh-uh just my husband and i and the two dogs so what about yours yeah well uh my wife and i we've got a thirteen week old baby so don't do much cooking for him yet uh-huh hm so i guess it's supposed to be dinner party is that what they said uh uh uh yeah what kind of menu would you plan for a dinner party and uh what kind of dishes you might have for it or some sort of thing like that uh-huh huh we don't let's see a good dinner party menu thank you i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming i guess um-hum um-hum i don't know uh something light and easy if it was pretty informal informal about anything um-hum well sometimes we'll have uh we'll have a bunch of people over and cook deer roast chicken oh gosh yeah how do you usually cook your deer how do you usually cook your deer huh how do we usually on the grill we'll take the back strap and soak it in Italian dressing for a couple of hours and throw it on the grill and it is good yeah yeah i imagine real good i would imagine it is either that or hamburgers we really don't have dinner parties yeah yeah i understand um-hum we just had uh deer stew sort of uh deer deer steak stew ooh uh-huh um what was it about a day day and a half in the crock pot um uh some deer steaks ooh ooh uh-huh in kind of a mushroom gravy um-hum um some veggies and a did you kill the deer delicious no no the times i've been out deer hunting i i i can go out in the woods unarmed and deer will be tripping over me and vice versa no uh-huh i mean i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles so no this this was given to us by some friends uh-huh um guy was in a uh in a hunting club um-hum and you know but the whole group goes out hunting and then at the end of the day they split it and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share and the rest of it's split with the rest with everybody in the group um-hum oh well that's nice well he wound they they went out last year and almost everybody got it the limit so there's everybody had deer coming out their ears uh-huh so yeah we still got some from last year yeah they they gave us some deer and some of it's still in the freezer and they was about eight months ago they gave it to us yeah no we we either crock pot deer or we'll uh you know put it out on the grill so that so that the bulk of the uh tallow will dribble off of it um-hum um-hum yeah we have we usually have most of it made into uh hamburger meat though yeah and cook you know spaghetti with it chili yeah that is good so deer spaghetti is real good um-hum anyway um no i think if i was going to have a dinner party i'd probably have uh sandwiches or something along those lines and then uh um-hum um you know just something light finger food sort of something or yeah yeah or maybe have something roasting out on a fire oh well anyway um we don't do much in the way of entertaining but usually it's one other couple come over for a dinner a hum um-hum let's see what did we have the last time we had guests over ah yeah we had a uh a turkey loaf oh was kind of taco turkey loaf uh it was good uh scalloped potatoes and ooh no it was mashed potatoes mashed potatoes with uh melted cheese melted over the top of them um-hum hm a couple things like that it was pretty good little dinner hm sounds good this isn't a good topic for me right now i'm on a diet yeah usually the kind oh don't you hate that yeah i've got a i got a a few pounds to lose myself that's okay i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old yeah i have too i was real skinny till i was ten yeah yeah i was was a left fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade grade at two  well you have do you have any pets yeah i do i have a like a seven and a half year old dog um-hum and he's kind of a big Benji long hair and he's white and he's the baby of the house uh-huh uh-huh and tonight he has a friend visiting who's a pit bull so they're kind of running around chewing on things uh-huh hm uh-huh yeah do you have any children or uh we have a child but he's like twenty so he's not like a chip you know like a little kid anymore oh okay i see yeah uh-huh so whether um why do you have a dog what uh-huh and uh why well actually we bought him for my son's thirteenth birthday and he's just been with us ever since and uh uh-huh we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves uh-huh and that's what pets are like yeah but he's like uh you got to have him when you come home and there's nobody here he's always here and yeah uh-huh so it's nice nice to have him there um-hum what about you how come you don't have a pet well mainly because it's just uh at this point in life i've had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um they're not even allowed here um-hum but uh when i was growing up i always had cats and and then um later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well they're totally different types of pets but um i see how dogs are really faithful friends and yeah yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies that's visiting with us tonight her dog is her life um-hum yeah and she has she has a German Shepherd tried to tell her to get a husband and for something and let the dog go but she's not for that she's in control she's in control with the Shepherd uh-huh yeah okay yeah that's true yeah my dad i think uh finds that he really enjoys his dog he says he's the best friend he has but uh but uh yeah oh yeah uh it's just i don't know that's kind of sad though i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my wife and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit um-hum uh-huh it's just when we first got him we didn't like dogs around the house or in the house and yeah but now we put up with about anything um-hum yeah well i've seen that there's there's a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems yeah they leave a lot of hair around and yeah yeah it it it's if like now you have to vacuum three or four times a week and it just i we didn't used to have to do that but uh um-hum uh-huh yeah but obviously you find him worth it or you'd get rid of him but uh yeah yeah could never get rid of him yeah you get you get attached i think that like maybe the first year of his life we didn't get attached yeah uh-huh we were kind of timid about it and because we'd we'd all we'd all had dogs as kids and lost them or something and and we do we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in um-hum yeah and hey i know at times when he's had emergency problems we're just a nervous wreck uh-huh so that's that's part of being a pet owner these days yeah and i don't know but cats i don't know you can have a cat in the apartment couldn't you isn't it well not this one i it's not allowed here but oh yeah the thing i like about cats is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends yeah um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them so oh wow yeah we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them and as they got older they kind of ignored us yeah um-hum yeah they'll do that sometimes so but with a dog they don't do that so um-hum when i was a kid i i raised parakeets oh really uh-huh so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy but um-hum yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didn't think much of those they were they don't have any personality yeah they're they're fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town so um-hum has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the food's not that great but a fish tank's wonderful to look at them you know floating around yeah yeah matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now yeah do you well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there yeah well there's enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but they're down visiting and uh-huh oh really uh-huh so it's kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house uh-huh  yes okay what do you do consider as as camping well um we've done a lot of tent camping that's probably the closest definition that i usually think of but um there are a couple of places in the San Francisco area that are considered environmental campsites that are sort of like rustic cabins they have no um electricity and no water um-hum but there's usually a pot belly stove or something like that and um-hum you can spread out sleeping bags on on uh wooden surfaces so hm it's a pseudo cabin but they call it environmental camping um-hum um-hum well the only camping the only camping i've done really is living in a tent we used used to go to Lake Shasta like fifteen years in a row we really enjoy that oh that's beautiful and uh you know take everything up there park our car unload the car and then go by boat to the camp spot you know two or three trips back to the car to unload everything uh-huh and uh the is it one when you've been there is it one of those uh state park arrangements where no no it was just a little camp spot that we found our you know by ourselves and it was usually in a little place called Calucci Creek uh-huh oh and um you know we put up our eating tent our john tent and our sleeping tent and uh slept in in the tent you know on i don't think i've ever seen a john tent that's well that's more rustic camping perhaps than i've done usually where someplace where we're sort of close to you know what it is it's actually one of those little tents that you take to the beach and you set up to change your clothes in that's what we use to put around our john uh-huh uh-huh that's great do you usually spend then quite a few days yeah it was like two weeks oh wow um-hum how do you like that i don't think i've ever been camping quite that long that seems like uh it was without showers and all you how how did you well just it was it was nice for a while but after fifteen years i got tired of it how did you enjoy that and then my next my next vacation trip was to Hawaii so it was sort of an annual thing every year for a while right right sounds like fun thing about Shasta too is there's so many other things that you can do but uh i've never gone anyplace else really except Lake Shasta camping you know uh-huh is Patterson fairly close to Shasta no Patterson's down by Modesto oh okay it's like twenty minutes away from i used to live in Oakland oh well uh and um used to go camping all the time up there but i've lived down here in Patterson now since eighty eight yeah uh-huh you know there are a lot of uh camping grounds county and state facilities in the Santa Cruz mountains south of here so um-hum tends to be a good place for us to get away sometimes um-hum do you have little kids that like to we have one two year old so actually we'd been camping for a long time before she was born and just now introducing her to her it to her rather oh uh-huh um-hum um-hum it's fun for kids though isn't it yeah they really enjoy it i think that she's at an age now you're not as concerned about where she's going to run off to she can pretty much stay close and you know um-hum um-hum i think her first camping trip she was eight months old so um-hum um-hum hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do um-hum well i'm ready to go camping again i i did go camping in a in a camper on a pickup deer hunting uh-huh uh over a weekend so know lived in a camper on that um-hum that's that's kind of fun we did that once in Yosemite too yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the bears and right that was one good reason in Yosemite the person in the camper next to us had gotten hit by the bears that night so we were glad we were a little more secure um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum but yes in fact i've never been camping at all in Yosemite outside of the uh the camper arrangement i know that they have tent cabins um-hum that sort of remind me of the environmental cabin situation but yeah it it it would be fun to go camping up there again i haven't been up to Yosemite for God i don't know how many years i would love to go up there again yeah it's a beautiful place i think i worry that it's changing so much so quickly the valley has become so popular um-hum yeah i know if they say the road up there is terrible now you know with all the traffic do you remember it a a long time ago i don't know if you ever went there like back in the fifties or it was a long time ago that i went there but i've only been there once oh uh-huh you know my folks used to tell me about trips that we took when we were little um and that at that time there really weren't delegated designated campsites so um um-hum um-hum people would basically come as soon as they could to stakeout their their terrain and put themselves basically anywhere they could find a spot so you go to bed at night and have a few people around you and wake up in the morning and just be surrounded there were no limitations in other words to the campsite there were people everywhere um-hum um-hum yeah yeah but it's beautiful though you look outside in the dark and you see all the stars all the stars up there and everything compared to uh you know living in the city it's a little bit better arrangement today um-hum um-hum  i don't know about you but i haven't had any trouble having any fun on vacation i can't think of any place i wouldn't want to go to take one um well where are some of the places you've been oh i know a real good place is Virginia it's real nice it has mountains beach whatever you want um-hum have you been in any great places lately well i've been a lot of different places uh Hawaii Japan Europe oh now i haven't been there and and most of the fifty i haven't been to Alaska yet yeah oh really you plan on going yeah i thought we might go up on the uh inland ferry that goes up there from uh from British oh yeah now i'd like to go uh to Canada on the boat right my parents went not long ago or to Key West have you ever been to Key West yes is it pretty oh yeah it's a long desolate stretch but well desolate in that it's all uh the same scenery after a while just like driving in the desert you know after a while it all looks the same oh really oh no no i've never been huh is it very expensive huh no no not compared to Hawaii huh well actually Hawaii is getting cheap too because uh really with the economic uh situation uh situation we're in they've lowered the prices uh quite a bit well that's nice to know well that's good where do you stay when you go to Virginia on the beach um yeah i've been to Virginia Beach and i've been up to the uh homestead in hot springs in the mountains it's real nice uh-huh and uh oh let's see i've been to Charlottesville through Monticello uh my husband's a a landscape architect and he uh he really liked that and to see Thomas Jefferson's home uh-huh yeah i bet well if he's a landscape architect he ought to like Washington DC in the daylight hours yeah now we we went there went there to stay at the Army Navy club with my dad and that was real nice that was real nice your dad's in the military uh no he used to be he he's a retired attorney now uh but he was the uh he was uh uh retired retired in the reserves for quite a long time and uh he's active in something right now i forgot what it is that's how close i am no i don't mean that but um i he's somehow connected still with it well being from uh living in Texas you probably like cool weather on your uh vacations at least we do yeah sometimes sometimes you know when it in when it's getting really hot in Texas you know you want to go someplace cool uh yeah well usually vacation time July August September it's time to go somewhere else yeah have you ever been to Arkansas oh yeah now i've i've been but not to way up at near Branson oh i hear it's just booming up there now um yeah up around Silver Silver Silver Dollar City have you been there no no i haven't i heard on uh what was it Sixty Minutes or something a lot of the country western um people are starting to build their nightclubs up there yeah i saw the Sixty Sixty Minutes also last year we went to uh the Oregon coast and and that is really beautiful yeah oh really really and that is really beautiful and it's also unlike California completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know how about population is it very uh crowded and and uh there's really uh several nice places to stay along the coast there we stayed at what was called the uh kite capital of the world what was the name of that city place hum Lincoln City oh and it is really nice uh we a very nice place on the beach and very reasonably priced compared to California particularly oh i bet really i bet but but it's not as crowded either so in fact most of the that's right most of the Californians that uh want to stay on the coast apparently the families and so forth they come up to Oregon and Washington coast to stay because it's much uh more economical huh yeah i'd like to go up around Washington sometime to see yeah we've we've been up that way and well this that trip we also went to uh Vancouver and out to uh Victoria which is very nice yeah well i think the furthest west i've ever gotten is the Grand Canyon well you got you haven't been to California either then no huh-uh no well if you go to California don't go to Los Angeles unless you really want to just see the movie stars set up and so forth oh i won't no no no but uh San Diego and San Francisco are both very nice right really i know my grandparents have been to San Francisco years ago and they said it was real nice  what kind of crimes you have in Hattiesburg uh actually about anything you can imagine uh from you you know this petty theft kind of crud going around vandalism up to uh certain amount of organized crime where uh gangs are starting to you know show up and actually you know qualify as gangs oh boy that's and Hattiesburg's not that big is it fifty thousand or so yeah uh about fifty yeah right around fifty thousand we i think we this census we just missed fifty thousand by a couple of people or something like that well but uh yeah it's it's right at fifty thousand yeah we're real disgusted around here in Austin we live in the city and on December the sixth uh four teenage girls were murdered and mutilated two blocks from our house at a yogurt shop um-hum murdered and mutilated mutilated uh they cut them up and they put ice cream inside their bodies and then they burnt the place down or tried to burn the place down as they left uh what these are girls who worked at this ice cream parlor or uh two of them worked there and two of them came to pick them up when they got off their at at eleven o'clock that night and all right so this so this is a place the the place had shut down already right or just shutting down just closing and i don't think the police have a clue uh they've had the FBI here and have some sort of analysis of who might have done it what type of person might have done it but um yeah character profile psychiatric profile yeah but it's just they're still begging for help and and and i just feel like some of they're helpless at uh trying to solve this one yeah yeah ah shoot the the big problem is there's no real punishment for crime anymore i mean the bigger the crime the less likely you are to get punished for it yeah that's true my wife and i read a lot of uh true crime books and you know court cases things like that i mean get adequately punished anyway yeah yeah and it boy it just upsets us when people get off with little or nothing they're they're on they're out on probation probation in fifteen years after murdering half a dozen people and yeah yeah it's just not fair well they slaughter innocent innocent lots of innocent lives and they get you know a few years and a slap on the wrist and someone else turns around and you know embezzles a couple of thousand dollars from the local bank and they you know they practically get fried yes yeah i think about a year ago here in Austin they were we were uh the gang problem was getting real bad and they hired a hundred new policemen and a lot of them were dedicated just to the crime unit or to the gang unit yes um-hum yeah and just recently they announced that they've pretty much got it under control there was only one gang related murder this past year yeah that's good if nothing else they've got the gangs pushed down to where they're you know not going to be very active at least as far as you know murders or open crimes are concerned yeah i think one of the things that they need to do more of which i seen a little bit here in Austin though is getting actual people in neighborhoods involved yeah the neighborhood watch type programs yeah that's one that's the one thing that starting you know the only two things that are really making a difference yeah are when the local people get involved and when they start doing something positive with families families have gone in the toilet in the last twenty thirty years yeah uh and it's as though they're really trying to push to make sure they go down the toilet lot of people lot of institutions they seem to be fighting against family seems to be that way i seems like everybody that we've heard of or know that go for any kind of psychiatric psychiatric help uh every problem you've got is blamed on your parents yeah and that to me that's just defeating the family right there yeah well to a certain extent it can be traced back there and and and that's okay to say so as long as you understand that you got to forgive i mean if you can yeah it's not like they doing it on purpose usually very seldom are they doing it on purpose you know you know out of my own family i i guess maybe i didn't have everything i wanted when i was growing up but i've as i've gotten older i've learned to accept the fact that i got what i needed i was clothed and sheltered and educated and yeah i had some modicum at least of acceptance and support i haven't blamed any of my future problems on on on the family upbringing or whatever yeah well that's the way it was with us we had i had a pretty good family life by comparison i had an excellent family life by comparison to a lot of people out there it may not have been perfect but they did what they knew how to do and they did it the best they knew how so yeah it's just i like i can't ever imagine my son committing a crime and i think he knows that you know that that's just something that not in in his world but there's so many people out there that do commit violent crimes and and small crimes and think nothing of it it's yeah yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go it it it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family i mean almost invariably children aren't taught respect they're not taught discipline they're not taught the need to  uh did you watch the Bulls this morning you know what i watched a little bit of uh of the Bulls game and i uh had to leave um in fact i i think the Bulls were ahead when i uh when i left who won the game they won in a squeaker they won by they won by two points uh they were behind as they headed into each quarter and then they came back in the second half and at the end i think they were is that right uh looked they looked like they were closing it out and then Detroit kept coming back and uh Isaiah missed a three point attempt at the end and uh i think the Bulls won by two uh-huh wow they've got the don't they have the best record now i think they do as a matter of fact one of the uh commentators said that they expected that the Bulls would uh if they continued at their current pace uh set an NBA record for seventy wins in a season yeah wow yeah they looked real good and they they do and they uh you know i think by uh by relieving some of the pressure off of uh of uh uh Michael Jordan really helped them out you know he doesn't have they don't have to rely on him to score every you know thirty or forty points at every at every game so right yeah well they they're they're balancing their attack and i think they look like uh they'll repeat although uh here in the Bay Area people are real impressed with what Don Nelson's done with the Warriors oh i know i'm yeah i saw the Warriors i saw the Warriors uh just a little bit of the highlights of the Warriors uh Dallas game i saw the the second half of the game last night and they were impressive they look good Billy Owens looks like he was that was a good move for the Warriors to trade for him yeah now i don't uh i haven't kept up with what was going on with uh with the Warriors well they traded away uh Mitch Richmond or is it Tim Hardaway one of the two uh who along with uh Chris Mullin was you know though three were three of the best in the NBA and and they made a heck of a threesome and they traded either Richmond or Hardaway to Sacramento for Billy Owens and uh uh-huh good move yeah oh yeah he's really worked out well they've got the the Warriors have got a team uh and uh i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the Lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it Boston in uh first place yeah uh i think Boston's in first um i you know i haven't kept up with any of the other uh teams uh i'm so depressed with the Dallas Mavericks you know boy they've had a hard time they said they've lost a lot of squeakers oh man that well yeah but i mean just this whole year has been just disastrous for them and uh you know they're going i i think they're going for an all time record of how many losses you know losses in a row they can they can they can uh pull out it's unbelievable yeah how do people in Texas deal with Dallas Houston and San Antonio do you for example like San Antonio uh in Dallas uh actually actually the the the Dallas area here uh pulls for Dallas uh San Antonio pulls for San Antonio and Houston pulls for for the Rockets so there isn't much crossover huh you they're really i mean not a whole lot you know i mean you find them they're find them be to be pretty loyal uh you know with with the local teams yeah um you know it's kind of i guess it's kind of like uh there in the Bay area you know you don't find a whole lot of uh uh of Sacramento fans yeah it's true because San San Antonio isn't that close to you are they really isn't huh-uh it's you know it's it's about the same uh same distance from here to San to San Antonio as it is from there to Sacramento so it's yeah it's not really a local you know no is it yeah so it's not something you'd drive yeah i was thinking maybe David Robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing um he does a lot of local stuff there in San Antonio and they i mean they have got a great club you know they've done a good job i mean of course drafting a franchise like him certainly uh yeah yeah that always makes a big difference so yeah i mean that's i think the way it uh i think that's the way it works now in basketball you you know Magic was a franchise for the Lakers and you know uh Bird for the for the uh Celtics and yeah and you know uh you know i used to think that that one one player really doesn't make the club but it really does you know you get somebody like Magic and you can see the decline of that team well it it's Steve well yeah i once he left you know i mean it's it's just not the same uh it's not the same team there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for well i think you're right and i think Isaiah Thomas would fit in Detroit and i think those things do make a difference and there are marquee players and i think i think Jordan and the and the Bulls have to be oh yeah uh considered the likely favorites i don't know who would meet them in the west um i don't know how good Portland will turn out to be by the end of the year they were so disappointing who won that Portland game you know i wasn't i i didn't i watched only a few minutes of it and i wasn't paying attention uh so i don't know uh but Phoenix you know Phoenix and Portland have both been very good clubs and uh  well Michael what do you think about um funding for AIDS research do you well um uh that's something i've never thought a lot about um i've i work in a hospital and i've worked in the hospital for about fifteen years and i've taken care of a few AIDS patients oops um-hum uh-huh uh-huh um when they asked us did did we want to um keep it the same or uh spend more or spend less i think uh yeah i think right now what what they're spending is adequate uh my for my personal opinion um-hum uh-huh um because i think it's something that's gonna take them a while to come up with a uh vaccine for i don't think it's gonna be that easy to come up with or i think they already would have by now you know yeah uh-huh and um so i don't know if if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now i think they're doing the is as much research as they can possibly do you know and uh what about you uh-huh well i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now you know i'm not either i'm definitely not aware of how much yeah uh it's something i've never really kept up with at all uh-huh yeah i mean i go ahead um-hum um i don't know i'm not sure uh i know uh i've always thought more about the disease rather than the the research you know what i mean and uh that sort of thing uh-huh yeah um if if we were talking about the money um i'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough simply because i don't know that much about it you know yeah yeah i mean i i can see that research is needed and you know definitely i mean it's becoming a major problem oh yeah i think so i think so yeah yeah but uh i guess the area that i think more about is i would like to see them focus on uh preventing it uh in more you know yeah well that's true that's true because um it's a such an easily preventable disease right and i i feel like just saying uh safe sex is not the answer it's it's uh abstinence in certain cases and yeah and knowing you know um no it's definitely not that's true that's true um myself um um i'm just recently or about to get a divorce uh-huh and uh course i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything but it's sort of scary yeah to find yourself single again you know and um because you never know what's gonna happen you don't know who you're gonna come across you know course it's it's not that i'm wanting to um-hum yeah i'm not gonna wanting to go and have sex with everybody i see but it's something you got to think about these days a single person uh-huh yeah um-hum you know and um i mean it certainly changed my attitude about that in a hurry and um yeah yeah i think for a lot of people it has so certainly yeah so but um uh i know that uh in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing to prevent you know so that uh the drug addicts won't be getting dirty needles and everything and uh i don't know i don't think that's a bad idea uh-huh drug addicts um-hum yeah i know it uh sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction it just sort of keeps that going uh-huh yeah yeah but um i don't know at least drug addiction can be treated whereas AIDS so far cannot be uh-huh you know so i don't know that i think that's i'm not too too much against the the passing out of the free syringes myself i don't know what do you think about that um-hum well yeah boy that's that's a hard issue it really is it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic yeah i mean i i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed but as you say um people i mean in the meantime well someone who's not ready to give up drugs um you know if they're perpetrating perpetrating the AIDS problem passing that on to each other then you know um-hum that's true that's true yeah you know i guess if you consider the two problems drug addiction an AIDS AIDS would have to have come first i guess as far as yeah yeah something to uh to do about it so so i don't know um course there's so many things in the world where uh-huh if you solve one problem you may be creating another you know yeah and uh so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse and which is the most important to solve at the time and i don't know but um yeah uh-huh yeah but i've never looked into how much money they're spending i have i have no idea um-hum and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that yeah but uh i really have never looked into it i have no idea um yeah i haven't either i've heard you know uh different voices speaking up and saying we're not spending enough and mostly that's what i've heard so i don't know yeah yeah right sure yeah and yet i know it's um it sounds like big money to me but it probably takes a lot yeah i think it is i think it is yeah it does every it seems to take more than uh for any little thing they do it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would you know but uh so um-hum yeah did you have any fear working in the hospital with that uh that's one thing i've never really feared um uh i a lot of the my family uh-huh you know they fear me working like that and under some some of those conditions but um uh i don't fear it at all um i work in in the operating room a lot and um and of course when we um-hum uh-huh um-hum  well Delphene do you own a P C well yes i do i have a T I P C oh in fact i have two of them i have i have one that i collected the the uh ports for one at a time oh really uh-huh like first i bought just the uh the central processing unit and the monitor uh-huh couple years later i bought a printer and then i needed a a hard drive yeah oh so uh there was this guy at TI selling a a TI PC for four hundred dollars and it had everything had the works wow and it had the hard drive and everything um-hum so i bought that one instead of buying a hard hard drive for mine so now i have that one with the hard drive and mine with no the the the other one with no hard drive with a hard drive uh-huh and what i thought i'd use them for was just to to do some work out of my house for you know people who needed uh word processing and stuff like that oh okay well that sounds interesting um-hum the my husband and i own a PC and i use mine for like keeping our home finances uh-huh and i also i i play several games on it uh-huh and i also was doing some work for my church doing some word processing on it for my church and that was really interesting being able to do that on the computer they were surprised at how much could be done um-hum with a PC yeah i thought i might uh get some extra income somehow or another uh i imagine if you advertise like in the yeah oh the i guess like The Texan's or if there's another paper up there at at your office yeah you should be able to get some work that way yeah i think i'll I'll i thought about doing that one time in fact i saw somebody else advertise in the Dallasite once uh-huh and uh thought about putting an ad in the newspaper also but then i might just get too much business yeah you really you have to be a little more selective but i right you might even want to consider cold calling a couple of places for or checking the newspaper um-hum uh there might even be cottage industries now listed in the newspaper because that's what it ends up being a cottage industry um-hum um-hum well i i found a uh book once in the library that had sources for um work at home um-hum uh you know some of them required that you have a PC but most of those wanted IBM compatibles yeah is that what yours is and as as you know the TI PC is not IBM compatible i was thinking that they had recently come out with one that is yeah they do the the um the Business Pro ah uh-huh which is that's what i have at work but uh yeah i still have the problem of upgrading mine either to a Business Pro or just going out there and buying a an I B M clone yeah um-hum there then i'll have three P C's well they're real inexpensive to get the clones now um-hum and i don't know if you watch your sale ads very often um-hum but if you do particularly Best Buy uh-huh and Circuit City and Circuit City i saw a three eighty six hundred and twenty megabyte hard drive with dual floppies and um-hum oh gosh the VGA color monitor um-hum and it also included quite a few other things i mean pieces of software and a mouse for about two thousand or less well um-hum and that's a really nice package for about that much money uh-huh i saw um in fact i believe the one i saw was a three eighty six also it only had one one drive though but it had a hard drive uh-huh you know some of them have the little uh the the small the three and a half floppy yeah plus the the bigger one those are nicer those i prefer that over the larger floppy um-hum i've never used one of those at all they take up it you can get more information on the disk you're kidding no i don't know what it is i guess because it's harder um-hum that you can get more information on it than you can on the larger ones and they're a lot easier to transport because it's harder to to damage them oh i didn't i didn't know that oh wow being in the harder plastic case um-hum so that's just a something that i've come across um-hum well i'm gonna look into getting one of those I B M clones well that's mostly um now that's what we have we don't have a real IBM i don't know of too many people who afford IBM but right but uh we've had not a minute of trouble out of ours not a minute um-hum and i would i would recommend it to other people  let's see i know i can guess i know what the rules are in Washington DC no handguns are permitted in DC at all but on the other hand in in uh Virginia it's supposed to be close to wide open right um-hum uh sort of yeah i live in Virginia i don't i work in DC so i'm uh and i'm well i'll give you a clue i've if if guns caused crime there would be a lot of crime in Virginia and not much in DC but uh so how does that rate you in the uh the scale that they've given us on a scale i guess i'm about a nine and a half so i've let's see so ten means what ten means no controls and one means uh one means total restriction one means total restrictions i guess i'm i'm about uh yeah i've i'm between nine and a half and ten i'm i'm not saying no control but uh nine and a half but uh are you an NRA member yes i have been since uh you know it's it's one of those things where they say uh that you're biased you're uh you're you're uh right this is a rather a interesting you're a member and so then the question comes up uh well if you really believed in it why wouldn't you be a member right but anyway i uh hm let's see okay now so you tell me where you are in the scale then i fall i fall i fall smack dab in the middle yeah um you're about a five you think sometimes it's right and sometimes it's wrong huh exactly i mean i'm originally from New York it so well it's i know it can be uh it can be kind of scary the idea of just everybody wandering around with uh uh you know absolute no limits or anything like that on the other hand the truth is that all the bad guys let me put this way all the guys that i'm scared of already have it right already have them or can get them if they want them and uh and uh uh when John Lennon got uh nailed right shot i should say uh one of the some some of my friends were saying you know that's another argument for gun control i said oh yeah he should have lived in in uh he should of have lived in in uh Ireland where they have a total ban you know in northern Ireland yeah that well i mean the same thing went everyone everyone uses England as an example saying oh well you know there there's no one has guns in England and look at the crime rate there it's so much lower but but the reason when i say i was really talking about northern Ireland you know because in northern Ireland there is a lot of crime and it's totally banned right right and uh the uh the uh how do i say this the uh the thing that i have noticed with uh this topic is that that i know some very intelligent people and i i say well here's a little brochure why don't you read this and see what it says i don't want to read that okay and uh um-hum where as i'm the other way i'll read i can read about when i say i'm the other way that's not to say i'm open minded uh as much as i think i am but i'll read anything and uh try and and pick it apart so uh let's see what was the other thing i was going to say uh now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then Virginia should have a lot of them should have a lot of crime uh i don't know that that kind of reflects my my feeling about it because you notice the states where they claim all of these things are coming from they don't have a very high crime rate right well i mean look at DC i mean you're talking you're talking about a district where handguns are illegal to be have to have at all and it's also the murder capital of the country and yeah yeah well the the the thing that i see is it's not the availability because availability is you know cocaine is is is outlawed too but right exactly but but it's the uh it's the nature and and my feeling if you go back to England uh England is one of those places where they have relatively low rates but also the rates of other crimes are lower right and the other thing that happens is they also have the ability to stop you and say uh mister you look like a pickpocket would you please empty your pockets crime um-hum and if you try that here in the States i mean you could unload four four pounds of dynamite and uh you'd walk because they they're not allowed to ask you they're not allowed to do that right so it's it's kind of like uh dandelions i don't know if you have any if do you own a house uh no well anyway if you had a lawn what okay uh uh if you if you've ever had a lawn i get the point yes i've had a lawn before if you've ever had a lawn uh and somebody says uh wait till the place is full of dandelions and then go try and and pull the heads off as fast as you can you'd be pulling heads off all day you know of of dandelions right and whereas in England where they come up they come up to a kid and they say uh you look like you've got a problem and he says i don't no i don't and then they say well uh let's go they can even go to your apartment and uh force you to open your apartment and anything they find in there is used as evidence so the result is that uh right  all right so i guess we're all right um i don't know what the laws are up in uh New York what's the law up in New York for capital punishment like it yeah well Governor Mario the uh holy one up here Mario Cuomo has been against capital punishment since he hit office here i'd say six years ago he's um-hum he's for the concept of um uh life in prison without parole and every single year up in here in New York state the uh government the state assembly gets together and tries to pass a death penalty bill and every year he vetos it and upsets people gets sort of repetitious yeah he upsets people up here um every time he does it i don't what it is down in Florida these days it's legal down here um i i know they've done a few most of the time they'll get real close and then they'll pardon him or it hardly ever gets to that point uh i don't think they've done one in a long time but i know it's legal and i know one just about happened recently but it never went through so they try but you know very few actually go yeah Mario up here is claiming that um the reason why he's against capital punishment is because to send these things through the court system um-hum on appeal then another appeal then another appeal ends up costing the taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no chance of parole so you know if it if it comes down to a money issue yeah i you know in that case then i'm all for putting them behind bars as long as there's no chance of parole but you know what it's like when they yeah there's always those loopholes yeah they fill the court there the jails up and suddenly let them go and they're back on the street we had this murder up here um Art Shawcross up in Rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here ooh and he was let out on parole from up in uh um Watertown and was that was that on purpose or was that a a snafu uh he was just well actually he it was on purpose i guess uh-huh he was uh he was a real psycho though and uh as a matter of fact it this happened under Cuomo's watch so the Bush administration was thinking if Cuomo is going to run for President they were gonna do instead of yeah that was his dirt huh yeah instead of Willie Horton now we have the Art Shawcross deal you know so so yeah i don't know what your feelings are about it being in Florida where you've had it before yeah um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically in terms of if you're absolutely sure i mean uh uh i i would feel that you better make sure it's one of those cases that has virtually no possibility of no you know you you pretty i mean supposedly you get through the courts you're not supposed to have any reasonable doubts anyway but i guess it would have to be one of those extremes in the first place but there's enough of them but i i've also heard that that these things cost so much in the end that uh that it really doesn't save you any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think uh personally i don't feel that capital punishment punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i don't think that really works that much yeah well of course you know we have New York City up here i'm in being in Rochester we're kind of yeah they consider us more in Canada than in New York State area but uh up here you know we have we don't have too many serious problems with crime but i know in New York City it was a real it's a big deal they would like to have it back yeah and uh i think it's gonna boil down to changing the governor if they really wanna put it through yeah uh they're building more prisons up here to try and put people in Attica is not too far away from where we are and that's at capacity and of course you know New York City is just packed with criminals that have done everything right it's so i you know i don't where it's going to go to in the end i just think that um i i i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's going to work and reduce the court load and yeah the like oh down here it's not all peaceful either though i don't if you've been following any of this stuff course we had the big snafu right now with the the Mets thing but there have been a lot of uh a lot of things going on down here all the Gainesville murders yeah yeah i we heard that yeah course i don't think they've they that then actually down here there's been more more publicity going on on police police screw ups and and uh beatings and everything than than actual murders and uh the Gainesville with the Gainesville picking up people seemingly  do you have a particular attitude about public education okay well i have one child that's in public schools now i have three children that went to a private school and then we put them into public school system and i think we did them a big disservice by putting them in public schools hm um i think that they my child now is in public school and we're getting ready to put her into a private school because of it i just don't feel like they're they're getting enough out of it you know for academic yes yes i just don't think that academically they're and the school systems here is supposed to be really good they have i don't know if you're familiar but Texas has uh oil money that finances their school system you know there there's no state taxes paid here uh-huh oh i didn't know so the money from the taxes from the oil go to pay go towards the schools and running of the schools so they're supposed to have a really good program but uh i don't know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight As and they're really struggling in college now hm and uh i think that it has a lot to do with it i don't i don't i don't know where where you can fix it you know what you need well apparently in your state there's more incentive to send your child to public uh to a private school because in New York you pay taxes for public schools and then if you wanna send your child to private school you pay again yes well you do that here too you pay higher uh property taxes for the area that you're living in depending on the schools and the area you're in oh okay i got i got the impression you said the oil money paid for the schools so no it it supplements the schools that for therefore there's no state income tax that goes towards uh the school systems ah uh-huh because of that you know because of that but the property taxes that you have on your home depending on what area you are you know like they're higher in certain areas than they are in other areas you know but uh sure right i don't i don't have any experience myself with private schools so i really can't say they're better i did go to public schools and what i'm finding um right now i have two kids and i'm going back to work and i'm substitute teaching in public schools um-hum and what i see in the high school is i don't know that it's public private i think times have changed i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen um-hum um-hum exactly yeah but nowadays the kids don't do their work and they have the nerve to say to you so what are you gonna do and you're not gonna do anything exactly well there's no disciplinary actions you know that can be done taken against them at all yeah but you yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their kids i teach art and they'll go yeah that's cool well maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should learn to act like grown-ups instead of the grown-ups trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked being friendly being friends with the kids being being friends with them and you know they don't wanna be so strict they don't wanna be so hard on them and i find that the kids are not turning in quality work because there's nothing to impress upon them that they better uh-huh right right and you know the kids i think that that's right i think i think a lot of that right there and and i think that that's where you come into the private schools the private schools have more power you know i mean because in public schools these people really don't have any authority to do anything or to really punish these kids in any way i mean they can't even hardly give them detention you know without well maybe they'll make them having to call their parents and have their parents come in and all this kind of stuff i mean it really is a major thing well you know yeah well maybe they'll make them stay home for a day but that's no torture for a kid no really exactly yeah to stay home is like oh yeah yeah and i know kids if they you know if they're late enough often enough they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents because their parents work so you know it's not a problem and i find that you know uh-huh um-hum they send oh because they send the report cards and and failing notices and stuff home in the mail um yeah well they they sent me yes that's true it progress reports progress reports well see up in Oklahoma now they do that but here they don't do that they give these progress reports to these kids my son is a senior and he failed a class this last six weeks and i'm like Kevin how could but he didn't even tell me you know and so i called the school i'm like i didn't even know that he had was failing this class and their like but we sent the progress report home with him well you think he's gonna give it to me i mean is he you think he's he may be failing a class but he's not an idiot oh sure they yeah they never have homework they always did it in school i have a fourteen year old son who is just getting into you know realizing that he can dupe me i think right right i know i but i i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to well they have to have parental support the parents have got they need the parental  Joe what do you think the election turnout's gonna be this year do you think it's gonna be typically uh this this year uh i think it's interesting uh we i mean there's so many candidates still that uh we have well there's uh we have uh uh Clinton and uh uh Brown of course yeah and then uh i don't know if you've heard much about this this other guy the independent Perot Brown oh yes he's from Dallas he may be drawing off some uh Republican votes and uh so it seem George Bush has completely locked up the republican although i think i don't yes i guess he has but if do you think there's gonna be enough excitement that we'll have more people voting uh i don't know i think that's i think that's hard to say i know uh Clinton and Brown are both trying to go after what whatever the block vote whatever that's supposed to be and uh i don't know i i think it'll be interesting i know a a lot of people have you know are are starting to feel are are more you know with the recession uh recession and everything i think a lot more people are starting to uh become more politically actively i mean yeah i think i think there will be more why what do you think well i i don't know i i think in terms of uh the national elections the election later this year since Perot is from Dallas and if he gets on the um-hum um-hum uh ballot i think there we that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual oh you see if yeah right right but i i think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections yeah i and i think it represents uh malaise due to well my vote doesn't count it doesn't matter anyway it's it's really i think it's more of a problem in the local elections right yeah yeah i agree yeah yeah i yeah i definitely agree with you there i mean it's people i mean that that don't care much about uh uh like federal things or you know things you know uh like the deficit people who don't who don't really care about stuff like that really don't have any clues to what's going on like right under right in their own towns or counties or state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know i it's it's too bad i you have more control over your local politicians yeah yeah you you'd think people would be more i don't know because they're more in touch uh they're you know geographically i mean uh geographically hm easier to get a hold of it's easier they're easier to get a hold of it's not a long distance call for one thing exactly sure yeah and i mean most of them are even you know you'll see them you know you know however many times a year they're actually in your city you know in your neighborhood or whatever but uh yeah i guess yeah it is interesting how that works and people just i don't know they just do you vote uh yeah yeah yeah i do vote uh i know if i when i first registered uh i guess with the last election uh i was uh in my late teens so i only really registered and voted for the uh who was that then that was uh Dukakis and uh uh yeah Dukakis and Bush i guess it was the last time that was i guess that was the first presidential election i voted in but uh yeah at that time i was really apolitical i mean you know that and like you said about uh local uh government or local uh politics i was just you know not in in touch at all well i i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think they've got enough going on yeah yeah that's that's that's true yeah that's not a part of your world no no that's true um campus elections are more important i suppose campus campus yeah yeah yeah that's that's that's another that's another thing too but there there's voter apathy there isn't there yeah well i'd say so sure i i know i've never voted in any of the just uh and why i i don't know i just don't see any i don't uh i don't see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even that smaller uh isn't uh arena of politics i don't even see uh you know any kind of influence or anything or any you know yeah uh um but uh federally definitely i i think everybody should be you know uh should definitely be uh uh aware of uh you know the presidential elections they should be you know uh participate a little more but then uh yeah yeah they should they should participate uh you know but also think about this if they're dumb enough to not vote do we really want them to vote um yeah yeah but but but i i i think it'll be interesting to see you know uh i think the people that vote are the people who um jeez now now that's hard to say it's hard to say who votes and and why um some of us i think do it out of habit yeah i i mean that's a good habit to have yeah oh it is it is and uh  your turn oh i i start okay well uh we keep a budget to an extent um and really it it we were really forced into keeping a budget because i'm i'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid uh how about yourself well i have to say i really don't have a budget both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say and uh we're both so uh frugal that um we really don't need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing yeah well i guess that really is sort of of keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically within your means yeah although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological yes uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um um they were where i came from in uh Dallas yeah so uh oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco that is a huge difference uh that presents um a real shock actually actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but yeah but you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful place to live yeah it's God's country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it yeah um so budget is not a problem for us uh least it hasn't been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasn't been when i uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly saly salary for engineers that in my discipline was like oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was um-hum you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then yeah well that's that's a system too sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so i guess you're indirectly budgeting um-hum uh just by by the fact you said that you're both very frugal uh in spending the money so i mean that's that's a form of budgeting i would think it's kind of a kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then yeah uh how big is your family uh well we're we have one on the way um my wife and then we're we're having one on the way in uh in uh September i see so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have no i think it's just going to be one oh all right how about yourself i have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point oh do they budget at all i mean do you have them on an allowance or i give them uh i give them an allowance and they um i basically give my son ten dollars a week and i put half of it in the bank and i give give him the other half in cold cash yeah and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wishes do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket yeah if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually  okay no my father was in a nursing home and uh-huh i just uh i really hope that i would just die before before and matter of fact you know i feel the same way for my mother yeah how long ago was that uh he was in the nursing home about four years ago but he was you know in there for several years okay yes but that was uh okay so that was fairly recent and even then yes a lot of the conditions i think you're right they haven't improved that much no they haven't and they they uh the way they the way the uh nurses and the nurses aids and they treat them yeah um-hum yeah the they treat them they treat them just utterly horrible they cuss them they tell them how sorry they are and that they're you know they uh one uh aid told him that he was no longer a man yeah huh you know i mean good you know it's it's it's really really bad and and on and on top of that i worked in a i'm i'm out of the warehouse now but i worked in a warehouse in the company for the company that i'm working for now sounds tough yeah right and two of the women that were utterly horrible uh-huh worked uh in the nursing home worked off and on for years in nursing home and they hate old people oh yeah that's that doesn't seem right does it yeah oh yeah that's really i'll say you know this really makes me feel good about what's going but uh yeah i you know you walk into one of those places and you basically start to feel depressed because they don't a lot of places don't have a good atmosphere they're just it's almost like they just shove people in there and wait for them to die right you know and it's it's really it's a bad problem uh i work at Honeywell up here and i was talking to a guy that's actually working toward mobility aids for handicap people and one of the things he's done is interview uh nursing home directors because they're looking for get this they're trying to find out ways to restrain patients so that they don't look like they're restrained because apparently the family members who come to visit get upset understandably upset when they see that their loved one is in restraints you know uh at the same time you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever oh how horrible right so it's an interesting problem that's just one of the many things that you know you have to think about in a nursing home right but you know the stuff that you told me is there's no excuse for that you know i know it there is no excuse that uh uh you know my uh one thing you really must do you know i feel like that go to a nursing home drop in at times that you don't normally drop in right stuff when they're not on their guard you know right and don't uh i i would go visit a nursing home uh several different times several different nursing homes before you came to the point of having to put a family member in there oh sure you know it's it's really a good idea to look at places and see what's out there and see what the the modes of treatment are right and and how people act right it's uh it's you you it's the same it's the same premise as day care for a child yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do and uh-huh he brought up a real interesting suggestion that works well for families that have a lot of kids in it like i come i come from a family that has five kids uh-huh uh-huh well the way he said it was our parents spent you know quite a bit of time when we were young taking care of us you know call it call it three years per child now if you have five children that's fifteen years total certainly uh-huh therefore shouldn't it be right that they should be able to stay with one family member uh in a rotating fashion for fifteen years free of charge well you dadgum right if you know there you go it it's essentially repayment right if you uh if the uh parent and the children will do that but there's okay yeah that's it but the thing is hold on i got one more thing and i'll let you talk because we started talking about that you know we started saying well you know some family members might not agree to do that i'm sorry right and he said fine let the one who does agree to do it keep him keep the father keep the father or mother for a longer time and charge the family member who doesn't cooperate just say basically look uh i'll take care of mom and dad for you but you have to give me a kind of a payment for doing that for you right you know so essentially it it relieved them of the burden uh-huh uh and at the same time everybody kind of comes out happy i don't know if that would work but then again it it depends on the family size right it may work with some families and it may not work at all with some families you know but my Lord you know i had a a yeah uh-huh  so uh i i guess it's subject is uh gun control yeah i um probably would put myself on a um five or six scale being up here in the uh northeast um i'm considered liberal but uh i believe in the right to own and uh have a gun for yourself if that's what if that's what you want as long as you don't have a record um-hum in the past of um committing crimes or uh something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh uh with regards to gun control the uh like convicted felons you know they shouldn't be able to have one um also i'm in if if if you look at it uh like say a waiting period i'm in favor of a waiting period as just that a waiting period before someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but uh i i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and so i can kind of see both both sides of of the of the uh issue on that yeah absolutely you know that's that's the one concern that uh i have too is that you know once you go down the path and you start with first it's it's background checks and and uh then it's suddenly age restrictions and then it's totally illegal um-hum yeah um-hum and you know i i come from up here i'm not in New York City area by any means so i'm in a a Rochester's not heavy crime area yeah but um you know and i and it's been a political issue up here um a a big deal about whether or not they should people should have access to handguns and uh some of these Saturday night specials and plastic handguns and uh-huh all of these new things i think pretty much up here everybody agrees that there should be more control on semiautomatic slash keeping automatic weapons banned uh-huh um just because you know what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do with an AK-47 i mean yeah that that is true um as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy they would be it would be interesting to have one shoot one but uh but you're right there's no no real legitimate need for one unless you consider um like personal defense like if your home or something that's it's kind of extreme i i don't personally own one but uh it's it's really it really is a touchy issue i know uh the uh like you mentioned the plastic handguns the Glock yeah it seems to me like like that that weapon they could it seems it seems to me like they could bypass all the i i think the um the major concern is is that they think that it can be slipped through airport security like it it say invisible X rays seems to me like technically that'd be very simple to solve just put some sort of a uh a metal flake flake or something that would show up on on X rays you know it to show the outline of the gun and then you'd still have the advantages of the gun which is i believe light weight and uh it would yeah yeah up here you know we have a lot of hunters up here if you go just to the south of uh Rochester here you have a bunch of state parks and there's a lot of hunting that goes on and uh that i think is by far the majority of people that own guns around here uh-huh tend to either be hunters or they live in the inner city and they're concerned about um uh their safety um we've had up here the NRA's main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting uh the people who are doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like New York City where you have an NRA movement that's more um attuned to personal protection versus hunting um that's pretty much how they've gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials um-hum um used to be they'd mention and with every membership you get fifty thousand dollars dismemberment insurance yeah yeah it's uh the NRA they're uh they're almost a little too radical in the other extreme i'm i'm i'm pretty strong in favor of of personal gun ownership but they uh they might even get a little carried away you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but well it's a powerful lobby i mean i've debated issues um on some other issues regarding the cable TV and that and uh the NRA lobby is the most powerful that's up there in Capitol Hill and uh they do a number yeah yeah uh-huh  all right do you have any uh strong feelings on schools well um i think that uh the majority of the problem with the school system um is similar to the majority of the problem in a lot of other areas in it's a question of economics and the school system is not designed to be successful um by that uh it's not really profitable for good teachers to be in the school systems uh if there are good school teachers good really qualified people as school teachers it's because they're dedicated not because they're rewarded for doing so um the school the public school system uh needs to be viewed i think kind of like the highways and hospitals and everything else it's part of the infrastructure it's something that has to be and has to be you know highly highly maintained in order for the nation itself to be successful and when you um when you neglect part of the infrastructure be it the roads or the schools or whatever then everything kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price i've i've uh heard heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but the counter argument to that is that uh there are schools around that are uh private schools not necessarily uh parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than they are in the public schools and they and their track records are much better hm uh the uh in in fact these days there's a lot of uh there a lot of uh Catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and and i'm not a Catholic so but i was just reading about this and what they were the the argument that i've heard is that uh and i subscribe to some of it by the way that uh our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and the public schools are not very good but the all all of the good schools are private schools over there and uh it's not that we're spending i i think that we're spending a lot of money uh relatively speaking on schools but uh as with other things you know it like Detroit Detroit or some of the other problems uh with Detroit it's not the worker it's the uh it's the management hm and uh management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the New York school system where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where um basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that yes yeah uh the rate of of graduating students went way way up and they ended up taking real courses but it was because they wanted to and because they chose to instead of were being forced to and and the the people were forced to compete and and the good teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff yeah and and well i see that as a as what i consider the biggest problem uh as with with uh oh there there are other problems and number one it would be nice if if teachers got paid uh uh i i hate to see the how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh uh sanitation engineers yes you know well the sanitation engineers that go out there with uh and just lift uh i hate to see those guys get paid more than teachers yeah and um-hum and different teachers are uh under a lot more stress and don't get any tips at the end of the day at you know at Christmas time yeah so uh uh from that standpoint and frankly the private school systems uh uh including colleges and things like that uh do quite well uh because there is a lot of competition um-hum and if somebody decides that they're going to if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop going there yeah and uh or they get a horrible reputation and they get this uh what do they call that uh  gun control um well i guess i'll go ahead and start off uh i'm from Kansas originally and uh in growing up you know basically yeah uh-huh uh we all learned how to uh properly handle guns and have the proper amount of respect for them you know we did the hunter safety training and that kind of thing um and uh-huh uh-huh so you know i i guess i really am not uh in favor of a lot of restrictions on on handguns just because least at least the environment i grew up in uh we're all taught in an early age to to respect them and handle them properly um-hum uh-huh um unfortunately most i guess most people aren't um and so that presents kind of a a a problem yeah um funny you know some restrictions may be necessary but uh you know a total ban or something like that i think is kind of out of the question yeah yeah yeah i uh i went through the same thing i i uh you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff we've never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because um-hum you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you don't you really you can't hunt with it uh right i mean you know you you can know how to treat them or you know how to to use them properly but i just have a hard you know i don't think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles sure just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun for it's easy for a kid to get to it and and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle oh yeah yeah so i yeah i'm along with you there i just i have real hard time with handguns but uh like i say i don't want anybody taking my rifles away from me but uh exactly exactly yeah uh did did you hunt much out there or in Kansas or in actually you know i have never hunted uh which is the ironic thing uh i've done a lot of target shooting uh-huh yeah um-hum uh you know to to get some skills but i've never actually hunted yeah well that that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean there's there's a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where you know if you could get some proper training and education it's you know i think you'd you'd find that all the the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old um-hum yeah i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasn't hunting yeah i had to know how to handle a gun and right i i think you're right though i you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just don't get that kind of training yeah and uh yeah and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff um-hum oh yeah um-hum exactly i mean a gun lock is cheap insurance yeah yeah you know um so i i i don't see any reason why a parent shouldn't do that well i mean i don't i have a real hard time with even keeping a a loaded weapon in my house uh um-hum oh definitely i would you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i um-hum you know i just there's nothing more valuable than life itself so right right yeah but yeah i i definitely i you know was reading the article on uh well on this Ross Perot you know how he's talking about running for the Presidency and i guess he's a conservative uh you know he's more of a Republican politically but um-hum he's got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess he's really for he's he's for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some yeah yeah he uh some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that aren't registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldn't want that to to happen yeah exactly you know i mean the guy seems like like a nice alternative but the problem is that i mean at least for me he's uh economically conservative which is good but uh socially he seems to be pretty liberal um-hum yeah yeah um which is not my bent i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for uh abortion rights uh right uh and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the NRA is their best friend and yeah the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the NRA sometimes goes overboard you know um-hum yeah i was just going to ask what you thought about the NRA uh you know they're i think they're like any lobbyist you've got extremists on both ends you know and they're saying that there's nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know um-hum and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying power power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and right yeah the slippery slope argument yeah and i you know i  well actually uh i i don't think i'm in the uh uh majority of in in Texas i don't think i agree with no uh i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a oh really you don't believe in it a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment but um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion yeah i'm not thoroughly opposed to it i still think it's sort of true that a a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought you sound a lot like a friend of mine a a girl i hang out with she has very uh-huh very black and white opinions you know there's no gray in her opinions you know she she probably would agree more with you but but i don't know i think i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again i've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done and we see that more and more like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who yeah raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know that's fourteen years old what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult uh-huh yeah i certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose yeah i'm not sure executing them uh does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh no it doesn't but it costs less yeah that's a factor and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in Texas for a little while and they're it that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia i mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia but even in Georgia that's the attitude for the most part if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine uh-huh yeah but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues yeah then i don't like you very much anymore yeah well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of dealing with crime and i guess uh i would like i don't know the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a they don't have a crime problem either no you can't they don't execute anybody in Britain oh really or France and i don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either and they don't have the crime problems we do i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two yeah i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh when i see people enthusiastic about it and uh uh sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that that bothers me but it but uh you might be right i mean i i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch you know i would never in a million years want that job but i do believe it's necessary and i on the one hand i i guess i admire the person who has the hum yeah guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and i couldn't pull the switch but i huh well actually i what the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it uh i don't really think it's a subject um very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else i think it just becomes a uh symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so yeah i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the right civilized western country now i'm i'm not so sure of that i'm i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor the other way around uh-huh what what's making you become more convinced that it might be a uh i guess i'm i'm my view of good way of punishing uh my i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and that uh uh costs and other factors justify uh um executing people maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that um um than anything else and uh yeah i've also never been a victim although i have some i have two friends whose wives were murdered and uh oh gosh yes if it ever touched my family i can imagine that uh uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case  person i've ever gotten yeah me too i guess it's the east coast time you know everybody else is asleep well i figured i'm available now and actually i've had this thing on speaker phone and it's it tried about fifteen time oh yeah yeah i've got i've initiated a few at the office like that and it takes a while during the day uh well it's an interesting topic wanna get going okay i oh okay here we go okay what are your thoughts on fitness uh well i exercise fairly regularly i work for a company out here uh in uh Livingston New Jersey Bellcore yeah Bell Communications Research and um we have in the corporate center where i work a health enhancement center HEC they call it um-hum and it's about as convenient as can be it's uh just two floors down from me and uh so i exercise regularly during the daytime when i'm at the office do they have Nautilus machines and that kind of thing and they have oh a bank of maybe six jogging machines they have a a um progressive weight machine that uh you know you dial up the weights on it it's not Nautilus but it's similar to that and then they have uh bicycles and free weights but they also have people who chart your progress uh and encourage you to come if you slip off for a couple of weeks they send you a a nice friendly aggressive reminder that says hey we haven't seen you for a while and they also provide towels and shower facilities and lockers and everything so uh you i've been through the routine i guess like most people where you know i've joined health clubs i've been at the university where you know it's a pretty good distance away you know quarter of a mile walk and uh nothing seemed to work for me as well as having it in my own building doesn't work at at at home you know i've bought home exercise equipment and stuff and right is this something you do on your lunch hour uh no i generally go down there um midafternoon um the time that seems to be best for me is around two o'clock two thirty but oh they allow you that free time to do that but yeah and that's you know there are people down there all the time you could almost hold meetings sometimes because people tend to set up a regular schedule and go down there uh but the the etiquette of the place is that you don't really talk too much business oh i really wouldn't have thought they'd give you that much free time this is part of your day when we're down there uh yeah yeah it just you know works out that way um and there have been a lot of studies i have friends who uh huh who work in the recreation field for companies like this and actually um a break like that increases productivity and and with the commensurate um increase in physical fitness by the people who attend these centers regularly you have uh fewer absentees and things like that so the corporation can justify it pretty well um and it's not like i'm taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because i'm now physically fit and reenergized i mean that my routine around two two thirty to go down there for an hour probably makes the last three hours of the day then more productive than i would if i you know just sort of went on through so well i i i used to exercise at night and i found that you don't come home tired you come home with a new found energy so you i can see what you're saying yeah yeah and that's what the late kind of the late afternoon is i you know i have a very light lunch because i know i'm gonna be working out and uh you you know usually then my lunch is just a a quick tuna sandwich at my desk so then and i sort of skip that luncheon right time and uh you know catch up on reading and then work out so that's that's kind of my routine hm i belong to a Y and i substitute teach so i would love to get there Monday Wednesday Friday or you know every other day but when the phone rings at six o'clock in the morning that's it um-hum and and it's kind of upsetting because if you go once a week it hurts every single time yes yeah you know i what i like about exercise i love the inaerobic exercise i like the weight machines and i like the free weights i enjoy that it's sort of a personal challenge to get better at that and you do see results real quickly um you know the the um-hum um stationary bike and those skiing machines that's work i'm not crazy about that yeah yeah we have the Nordic machine and i tried it a couple of times it just made me feel stupid and uncomfortable and uncoordinated so i don't do that i sometimes it is used regularly by you know people but uh i i didn't like it well i find i i you know i read somewhere that twenty minutes on the bike is what you need every other day and and i can do that and be pretty comfortable about it but i tried the Nautilus machine yes it you do feel kind of goofy but even five minutes makes you feel tired you work harder on that thing um-hum um-hum yeah it it appears so i generally use the um the treadmill uh i kind of like it it's it's mindless you just get on and it's a a way to sort of um reach a Karma very quickly you know  uh i'll start um up here in Rochester or down here in Rochester recently they put in a law for mandatory recycling in our area which involves collecting newspapers and and bottles and cans and a recent new statute that they just put into effect requires us to open and sort every single piece of our junk mail and actually separate the uh standard nonglossy paper and uh from the glossy stuff hm and uh throw the plastic windowed envelopes away while recycling the junk cover letters for all of the sweepstakes entries and all this nonsense um-hum so it's been uh hectic it takes me a lot more time now to go through my mail oh my Lord here in uh Framingham they just started recycling and we have to mostly they're doing the plastic bottles which we have to soak the labels off of and you know milk containers orange juice containers and uh they're doing the newspapers and we have to sort out the ad pages and just you know the regular newspapers go in huh hm and uh we can put like regular white paper in and they've started recycling in the school systems white paper only not yellow paper or lined paper you know just the plain white paper well they they've got up here where we can recycle our magazines our our um uh any correspondence paper anything that is not of glossy wow um finish except for magazines they'll take magazines they'll take um uh most kinds they take plastics i think beginning with numbers one and two on the little bottom uh on the bottom of the bottles and the like and of course we've had to bottle bill here with Mario Cuomo for many years uh-huh right so we've i actually what i did is i went out and i got a separate trash barrel where i put my recycled papers in and we don't have to separate out like for example a Kraft envelope um-hum you don't have to sort that from um a sheet of typing paper um i basically just kind of keep pushing down on it and i i try to get it all in there every week and then take this fifty pound barrel out to the end of the street every Thursday so they can pick it up and haul it away um-hum that's what everybody's complaining about they gave us these big restorage bins you know they're plastic they look like milk crates only about they're about three times as long um-hum are they the blue buckets we have them yes Framingham has a lot to catch up on and um you know it's quite a pain in the neck well you know what happens what we hate is when the wind picks up everything blows everywhere because and and people won't put things on top to hold the papers there right or they'll or even worse is when it rains oh God they don't like it if you give them soggy they won't take it if it's a soggy magazine uh we we have these stores up here that do the same thing as far as bottles and that if they're not washed out right they're getting to be real stinkers here in Framingham too they used to take them no matter what but now they have to be washed out and everything else and it's like nobody bothers anymore well it it is it's terrible because uh we have a chain store here Wegman's and they'll only accept bottles from uh products that you've bought at their store yeah so if you're shopping in two grocery stores you have to remember okay um this came from yeah because they won't well we don't sell this so you know we're not gonna take it um-hum um oh it's terrible we've just recently um they've been they've been fighting more and more because they wanna they wanna have it so that we can give them all of our junk mail right that would be nice in it because it's terrible i mean i normally normally i open just bring the mail bucket i get every day and just hold it over the trash can and just start shaking you know yes no i'm not interested in this no i'm not but now we have to open every single piece up and sort it oh that really so you know you don't fill out Publisher's Clearing House you know you got oh let's see now are these yeah you have to take all that stuff out yeah are these stamps uh recyclable and we have this book that tells you what is and what is not recyclable oh my Lord so you got to like scan down let's see now it's that must be hysterical it sounds really funny we have people here they started locking up private dumpsters well this doesn't because everybody was taking their trash to the dumpsters so they didn't have to recycle oh yeah it's it's been it's been rough you know they they've been complaining because  i you know actually in this modern day and age it seems like uh uh we have more and more leisure time because uh we have so many uh convenience appliances and whatnot and we don't even have to cook dinner anymore uh yeah really but i uh i've heard i don't know this for a fact but i've heard that a lot of families really don't spend a great deal of time together that kids the kids maybe on the average get uh something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents that's what i've heard too uh it seems bizarre to me i don't quite understand it although i think probably the the worst thing that's happening in the world at least the modern world today is television yeah not so much because uh it's bad per se although there is some pretty crappy programming and i think there's also some uh i think um poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time right it's so darned easy to turn the thing on i know it i've i've found myself sometimes just sit down after work and so i refuse to have one in the house yeah oh really well good for you good for you a lot of people i've talk to a lot of people about that and i've thought about it myself and i thought about it a lot um but uh i still haven't done it yet well that's good well i'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you i mean the kids can be a real pest uh and turning the TV on is almost like magic you know it's uh like sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them that's true i've noticed that but i don't think it's too good i don't think so either um so you know i don't know i take advantage i don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but i take advantage of um dinner time we always eat together and you know whenever you're with your kids you wanna interact with them rather than just ignore them do you keep your kids uh active in sports or anything or uh i guess our big outlet is music um our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello oh okay and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello so there's plenty of okay plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice i guess that's not a big surprise no not for kids but i mean i imagine with infants you are most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them yeah well i i i try and read to them and although you and i take them to the park and stuff and oh you know reading is so good yeah i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore yeah well they get to this stage uh but i read you know there's this Doctor Seuss sleep book have you ever seen that yet sleep book no yeah it's called a sleep book and uh you ought to get it i tell you i read that book to my kids so many times i almost have the thing memorized uh we've got a quite a few of Doctor Seuss's books and yeah well i think i think his sleep book is my favorite oh really um-hum well yeah i like to i like to do it and they enjoy reading and i've actually i never read a lot growing up and i never read until a few years ago i just started picking up books and so it i've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read to i like to get away in a book you know um-hum um-hum and so i've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids um-hum to try so how much time do you think you spend with your kids on the average per each day oh i probably spend an hour or two oh that's great my wife works at night so she does uh Tupperware so she's gone a lot at nights and so i spend a lot of time with them oh i see so how old are your kids again they're two and one two and one um-hum yeah so you have your hands full with them that's for sure yeah  uh do you have a couple of children i have one she's twenty months old uh-huh oh boy how many do you have how many do you have at least you're sleeping i have uh two boys one's eleven and one's fourteen oh i imagine the activities we uh encounter with our kids are quite different at this point they probably are but maybe you can give me some insight and i can remind you of the old times huh oh i remember them fondly it seems like the the baby like young children uh destroy your sleep and older children destroy your life yeah and i don't really mean that it well i've heard that it only gets worse my husband and i sit around thinking gosh you know what are we going to do when she starts going out and having friends and going to school and getting exposed to all the other things out there oh i think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this yeah and you really have to wing it you know as you go yeah yeah but i i remember fondly having the small ones they they seemed real happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just seems that everything is more serious and and complicated it's more complicated it's emotional it's not a matter of giving them a lollipop anymore it it just gets harder yes but um what we've done and you might want to do as you know as time flies by is i'm remarried and my husband never had any kids uh-huh so we were trying to figure out how um how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what we call the family meeting um-hum and once a week we get together and this is a chance when the kids can say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it yeah and we have sort of an agenda that's like good news this week bad news this week uh suggestions any new business any uh hm any questions questions any anything you know and we how long does that last how long does your meeting last well it it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where kids want to go do something else so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through you know collect that sounds like a good theory or a good way to do it well you know we we actually sit and talk to each other once a week at least you know not that we don't all the time right but it it it works out nicely and i don't know you know i think i'd do that even if i wasn't remarried if i had thought about it yeah and you know we plan also plan a family activity because people are coming and going and it's hard to be all together to do something so uh-huh what kind of things do you do on the family activities well it could be a game of Scrabble and or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person um-hum and um it's it's not something that's impossible i mean the kids will usually want to go to a game park or something you know we can't do that you know we try to keep it real yeah right it's getting quite expensive to do that these days oh please yeah that another thing that comes up with us is family vacation yeah we just kind of knock our heads we don't know how to make that right it seems as if we do what they want uh we marathoned a trip in California we stayed with some relatives for awhile and then we went to Sea World and we went to Disneyland and we we went to every kid thing did you drive there uh no we we flew to California and we stayed free at my aunt's house so that gave us a base in San Diego yeah yeah and we saw Sea World and the zoo and this and that and our lives were sort of normal because we you know it was someone else's house so we made sure we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing then we drove a bit further and when we were on our own it just kind of fell apart because we'd stay late at the parks and i didn't enjoy it after awhile you know once is you know it's interesting but it's really not my cup of tea and family vacations are kind of difficult yeah you know sharing a room with the kids is not much of a vacation once they're old enough to know the difference true true so yeah my husband wants to go on a family vacation we're on the east coast like you and he wants to go out to uh the Grand Canyon and do that sort of thing when Helen gets a little older but it's hard to tell i at twenty months old he's he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but i'm not sure if she's ready for any of that if she's you know if it could hold her interest hm so we don't really have anything any kind of family activities to do we basically just sit around the house and she runs from one to the other and we read to her that's something she enjoys well i guess the playgrounds used to be hot when the kids were little yeah there's not many of them out there though like was when i was young huh i mean there was a playground just about in every neighborhood but i don't even know where one is around here anymore there might be some at the schools yeah you know that you can use when it's an off time you know on a weekend or something yeah that's a good idea and a lot of if you have a a YMCA or something they have kind of a tot programs where they have little exercise class for kids her age and all kinds of things uh-huh yeah hm what help yeah go ahead probably probably be very hard to be the instructor twenty months old huh yeah but that's not your problem that's the fun of it you  so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy well i don't know what do you think oh i don't i don't know i had a little bit more time to think about it i was thinking of like uh i don't know i started i started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports and um-hum and all those you know demographics studies that they do that um you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that you've made and everything kept tract somewhere and i don't know i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but um-hum i know they use that i mean they they sell those to well what about the required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment yeah that was that was that was the other one i was thinking of i think that's uh i mean i know drugs are illegal it a subtle thing actually um i uh have worked at Texas Instruments uh uh-huh and uh they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees um-hum and actually to tell you the truth i really didn't think much about it i i hadn't you know it really didn't relate to me but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have uh-huh and also um uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity and yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it it's actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure um-hum so what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this although they don't actually execute execute it themselves it's really the government's that so in that sense at at least uh philosophically it's really borderline legal um-hum well i i think that um i think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior and if they're you know if they're on some kind of you know controlled controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person know who is able to evaluate them i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a you know a chemical you know well what about this uh AIDS epidemic now where you find that uh uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for the people that are carriers and don't uh don't reveal it others yeah and and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't get uh it destroys their libido yeah that's that would be kind of an extreme now uh you know if they ever i mean i've heard of things like you know making them you know uh marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all some some place like in a kind of a so what about that as an invasion of privacy yeah well i guess it kind of borders on where yeah i mean what do you value more the invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to you know other people so really it it gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare yeah of society i guess that's always that's been the big role of government i guess well are it's supposed to have been i mean generally yeah yeah well yeah that's kind of a difficult one to go into i mean that that particular case now it because i mean there's a lot of people that uh i mean they could require one you know obligatory obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because i'm sure you know there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know the the AIDS population i guess that have it that don't know they do a growing part um-hum and are spreading it but again to require you know such a test and just and then to make make it known they have it is to subject them to to discriminatory discriminatory practices and other things i don't know uh i don't know how exactly i feel about that maybe chop their weenies off  okay i um to let you know what i feel about drug testing uh i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against right testing those people who are in critical uh jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people's safety right for uh for uh uh a larger number than just their own personal safety correct i just think that it's yeah uh unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned huh and uh we have had situations here where people were accused of um uh utilizing drugs and uh it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives right right and the same goes with uh you can eat poppy bagels poppy seeds um-hum and they'll come up as a as a positive for drugs as well which is i you know i'd i'd just heard that uh just recently and i thought that was interesting uh uh do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or yeah i i do i um i have a little problem with somebody testing uh for drugs just in general as an invasion of privacy uh but i do agree with you or regarding people that deal uh with groups of other people that their lives should be they should feel a little more safe and there should be more of a safeguard you know air traffic controllers airline pilots uh anybody that deal with the public in a uh i don't know what uh a fashion that their lives are in their in in their hands yeah i i know that they were up here in New York um uh i've noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn't thrilled with the idea and we have uh uh-huh various government officials here who basically don't feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they're continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it's antidrug war right um figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of anything internationally let's make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and within the community yeah and and that way we'll we'll nail those nine to five worker users without really solving the problem of trying to really do something and through education and that yeah yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this um that's than uh anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal right yep you know all that um well did you hear about the uh what was happening in the Boston area uh for i guess for about the past five they've been testing babies for AIDS uh oh really but not releasing the information yeah i they were just testing to find out how prevalent it is uh in what demographic and segments of the population but they weren't telling anybody if they did it when when the results came up positive or negative they weren't telling anybody hum well their sure they were probably afraid of being sued well i'm sure and also bringing light to the fact that they weren't getting parental permission for it yeah they were just doing this test yeah it's one of these slippery slope issues where once you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing it's the same thing with the lie detectors yep and uh the physiological test tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees yep and uh at times it's hypocritical as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things certainly don't want them applied to themselves right exactly they want to they want to be just above in that regard uh yeah i i i don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in in Rochester Rochester no in western New York there hasn't been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in New York City yep who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage uh well there's always there's a standard joke about the Northwestern pilots oh yeah wasn't that that thing in Minneapolis or something when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or they had their light yeah  uh what are your thoughts well uh interestingly enough i've been reading in the paper about uh the option that says basically none of the above yeah and and uh given the choices that's sometimes how i feel i generally support President Bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the the economy is really not his fault i don't think uh-huh no no but uh as far as anybody else running i think wow is this the best we have to offer two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah i uh uh on Sunday night i was listening uh listening to uh the radio and they had they had speculated that uh there was some rumor that Tsongas was thinking of running again yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out he's still got a lot of support in New York apparently uh-huh and today today you know it today is the New York primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good he's still on the ballot in New York and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump back in uh-huh well that doesn't that seem sort of uh uh it doesn't seem seem like it's useful for him to uh doesn't it seem like a waste of money though for him to come back into the race this late uh what are his chances of winning at this point well obviously he thought they weren't too good if he if he backed out exactly uh i don't know maybe you know New York is a big primary uh-huh and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry New York strongly then he could still make it uh-huh sure but uh i don't know yeah what what did you think about the Buchanan this term uh it's hard to say it's nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know uh-huh uh-huh but it it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend himself yeah so i think in that sense it's good i don't think that uh he's experienced enough to do the job uh uh-huh on the other hand maybe he is i mean the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it uh-huh right right well it's yeah i i agree with you it does seem that he came in and kind of fluffed the pillows uh you know uh for the campaign for the campaign anyway so we didn't have to hear the same thing again how about you yeah uh we didn't have to uh we didn't have to ignore a lot of uh Bush's success because you know he really did a lot in the last term he uh with with the Gulf War and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his his accomplishments you know i i really do think i am going to vote for him again next term but um-hum but uh i wanted to know exactly everything that happened you know a lot of times maybe i forget well when you look at it too how much does the Gulf War really count i mean how for example how much has it helped us as as a people oh sure i'm sure that we can say it helped the uh enemy rate of Kuwait um and uh sure it shook a people a few people up in Iraq but uh-huh uh-huh is is that a success or is that just sort of uh part of the job description as far as the President goes right right uh what what i mean is though the strong sense of uh nationalism that occurred you know right after the war uh sort of heroized George Bush you know whether or not it was you know a success for us or whatnot he tended to come out of the out of the yeah experience you know as the great American hero and uh oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time yeah yeah and it so i i i am i'm glad that uh he can't get into office this time without at least uh addressing a lot of the the home front issues yeah uh-huh and uh well Todd uh it sounds like uh we may have covered a uh a minuscule portion of politics today a very minuscule portion so what about Libya what about Libya i have no idea what to say about yeah you you've heard of the goings on there i guess yeah i i don't know uh if you know if you'd asked me the same question about uh uh Kuwait you know at this early in the game i don't what i would have said then either i i don't uh now of course the last time i listened to anything was on Sunday uh and they had still refused uh the concessions by the Security Council so i thought it was let i have to make sure i get the uh stories right because because there was also yesterday the attract the attacks on the Embassy but now didn't Libya right  uh do you have any brilliant inedeas about how to reduce crime no i really don't they need to do more with uh you know the police forces they need to make sure you have more people out on the street i think you know to try to keep track of what's going on and be harder on criminals when they go to court you know make sure they go to jail and they serve all their term it seems but other than that i don't really know what about you well it it seems like such a catch twenty two you know my first inclination is to say stop being so lenient when people do something rotten you keep them in jail and you make them know that your serious you're very serious uh but then again uh right the taxing situation you know how can we pay to keep all these people in jail that's when you say well don't raise my taxes you know maybe we shouldn't lock up the guy who has too many traffic tickets yeah maybe we shouldn't do this and you know and then you stop start eroding it right you know i substitute teach i deal with high school kids and right oh you do and i i find that attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and they won't even go oops you know they they just have no regard and i'm not saying they're gonna turn into criminals but i think it's a general trend toward people just relaxing their standards so much and i think that's why we have more crime because parents and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young that's true um-hum oh and they just keep pushing i believe i believe that's true i think you have to do more the teachers as well education but before they get to the high school of course because by then they're pretty much set i think yeah well you know you start way back when yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you going to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about you do your work and he said well how about i throw these scissors at you and instead of getting uh flustered i said well i wish you would because then i can really punish you i can send you to detention et cetera if you just bad mouth me and generally giving me a hard time there's really nothing i can do um-hum right and and i think you know minor criminals feel the same way like what are they gonna do right and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep going um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore so people don't think it's any big deal and they just go out and do it again nothing's gonna happen to them well we had a yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them um the people who were in the car who got hit two of them died and two of them seriously injured this guy you know crossed a divider he had been arrested twice for drunk driving driving um they didn't lock him up they took his license away but they didn't take away his car key um-hum you know there he was you know it's like you know in the old Arab countries you know you steal they take your hand away i mean this guy can still drive as long as he can get into a car he's driving right um-hum so it doesn't do any good people just do it again same thing with when you have like sexual offenders and you don't make sure they have you know he's just yeah and i adequate counseling then they just go out and do it again because you haven't really fixed their problem at all right so and that's probably the problem too because do you bother counseling these people or you make them go to jail will it really do any good to counsel them or is it just gonna waste taxpayers' money well you know i think counseling is kind of like dieting until you decide you really want it to work you know right right it it's not gonna work anyway you have to cooperate with that kind of stuff i i it's a real scary problem i don't know what the answers are yeah and the problem is yeah i guess that's why we have the problem nobody seems to know what to do about it but yeah that's true yeah you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties uh i guess you know the the top of the the bad guy ladder maybe you know some of those people would be affected but there's lots of crime going on besides murder where right you know it's still out of hand i'm just afraid that if you put back in the death penalty every place that people be um the juries won't want to convict a person because what happens if they are they're really innocent because once and you kill them they're gone you can't like fix the problem so there'll be that much you know there'd be really really worried about sending them to jail when they really should be in jail they'll be like well i don't know and the people who don't wanna put them you know to death who think that's wrong won't convict them either even if they really believe they're guilty because they're really just problem on their part things like that my husband makes a joke about well an armed society is a polite society if if good guys had guns as well as bad guys then you know maybe that wouldn't be but i said nah you still have survival of the fittest because you know then the bad guys would become better at using the guns you know right right and if nobody had guns they would just use some other  yeah go ahead okay well um i've never i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast um i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times you know right and you make more money but it goes away anyway right well i don't have to worry i mean i don't have to think ahead as much like you know but i haven't really saved anything i'm still trying to uh i've i have school debts i'm still paying back and stuff yeah i have three children and a house so uh it's a serious it's a serious matter but uh my wife's just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the oh okay so you have to budget pressure off but i must i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like right tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i don't i've started keeping a budget on computer right i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh um-hum i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going right then you it's it's easier even if you don't stick to it i think it you know it's better to have you a little bit more conservative hm right i believe if i had to that i could estimate all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan yeah but but even if you can't i don't think have enough a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly where every penny was going before i had it but it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway yeah but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children what you're gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and that's uh you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow right and that's hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated don't ever you know just right just blow a little bit that's you know right but you'll find that the kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly right i remember doing that as a child and i've i learned to say no pretty much constantly and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month i'd feel better about it yeah yeah so who knows maybe this'll get me to do it you don't have children yeah no i sure don't well that's a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them oh i know i mean i've i've had i have a cat and that's you know that's well that's one solution that's hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know that's a lot some sort of you know when some there's times when i if i couldn't afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them for her first you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know that's an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they don't take no for an answer as easily well then uh yeah they are a lot simpler but but i'm i'm just saying you know i yeah it it would it would be hard to know that someone else's life was completely dependent on you you know yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what they're gonna need in five or ten years that's uh really difficult right it's hard to see that right now even though you know you have too yep right well i've made my confession yeah i'm and i'm glad we had this conversation because it makes me think i need to sit down and maybe write  what do you think um i don't know uh regarding um should the judge do the sentencing or not i think the judge should have some in influence but i don't think the judge should i think that's too much power in the control of one person i agree i really agree with that it uh it just doesn't seem to make sense that if the trial is by a jury of your peers that the sentencing should be somewhat along that i you know i guess the judge should give the parameters right right right and then the jury should work kind of within there and if they feel exceptional one way or the other do you know what i mean right right yes i do i i have been thinking about this you're about the tenth person they tried to call for this so i've had lots of time to think but yes i do because um oh is that right otherwise why have a jury that's the point right yeah right it seems to granted you're found guilty or innocent by a a group of peers of your peers but then the punishment you know can be very very severe depending on the the judge's personal uh predilection to that right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury than you do with a judge and that's that's been my experience and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice right yeah i i would i to just their own idea and they wanna get it over with right i mean they're human they're gonna have their their pet peeves and they're gonna have the things that they really care about or don't care about uh-huh right um so let a group of people have you know try to try to make make you know use that uh make that decision yeah i would feel much more confident if that were me so unfortunately though it does string out the uh process but you know well it does but i think it's because people are trying to be conscientious where a judge it's their job and you they just wanna speed it along and get it done and i don't think they stop and think about that individual as much as a group of people would yeah right see i i also think there's a problem with the plea bargaining system in our in our country in that you can uh plead to even though you're guilty as sin yeah yes yes yes excuse me you plead to a lesser crime yes yes i think that that in of itself is a sin i think that we're having a lot of problems um with just everything and the whole the whole system is bugging me it really is our jails are over crowded with people like Leona Helmsley who's seventy two years old and with a blank check in front of her yeah yeah i don't think should go to jail i think the punishment should fit the crime i think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous and i don't think they should get out on parole in three years right i think they should stay there they did it they stay yeah i well i and people with traffic tickets and that there's another way to handle that i think yeah um although i'll tell you the there is something about that woman uh her crime was is what they quote call a white collar crime as opposed to a blue collar crime such as crime stealing so uh well but she stole well yes but if you look at it in relation to the amount i mean it's one million dollars which to you and i sound exorbitant it's a lot of money but compared to the six hundred million that they paid in five years that's like one dollar when we owe six hundred that they the six the six hundred million that they what now so they paid taxes six hundred million in taxes over that five year period oh i see what you're saying yeah so if you look at it they don't say that very much in the newspaper yeah well no but they also diverted uh millions uh to their own personal assets that were hotel monies well possibly you know i don't know but if they're willing to correct it i i don't i don't see that she belongs in jail the same as somebody who goes out and kills and walks away i mean i there are worse things that people are getting off with you know that kind of thing oh see yeah yeah i have to i agree with that there are worse things that people have been getting off with but i don't think that that we then should have Leona get off i think that they should be hit even harder see i'm an advocate of the death penalty myself yeah now i don't know of a lot of people that are well there are and there aren't and i just happen to feel that if somebody does the crime well yeah i mean if they murder somebody they take someone's life get them out of society i just don't feel like i have to pay my tax dollars to have them in jail i yeah i just it's a tough line yeah i know i agree with you agree and but i don't think the way we're executing the the capital punishment is is a deterrent although i think capital punishment is a deterrent i do too if it's done right and that means that this is the way it is no ifs no ands no buts a certain yeah it has to be a consistent thing right a certain number of appeals and then that's it don't stretch it out for years get it over with and get it done yeah um-hum
