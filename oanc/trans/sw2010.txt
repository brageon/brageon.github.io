 okay okay you there well have you had this with one of your parents yet uh not with my parents although my parents are now in their early seventies uh-huh and uh fortunately they have to this point been very physically healthy and very self sufficient and they really look after themselves and i think considered what they want done as they get older and maybe less able what what is do they want done that's interesting that they've already said well the it it's more that they have when they retired and we are from South Dakota uh-huh so they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls which is the biggest city in the state uh-huh and set themselves up near medical facilities and i i can't say i can tell you what they've uh decided as to okay because i think some of that is that maybe you think ahead somewhat but you don't uh book those facilities yeah right and it depends on their health too i know some people say they never want to go to a nursing home you know where others say well you know put me there if i get that bad you know uh-huh now my parents are seventy nine and eighty one uh-huh and they're they're still taking care of themselves but when they were your parents age they were doing much better now it's gotten to where it's just barely and we know it's going to be probably anytime you know that that we're going to have to change them from their home or something you know well have they do they recognize the coming and try to make the decision themselves no my stepfather is one that's always had a horror of nursing homes and don't ever put me there now my mother on the other hand i do not think would mind you know uh-huh uh-huh uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and it's and rather than in a city where you probably wouldn't know anyone so that would be to their uh-huh advantage but uh i guess you know i don't know how long i have a brother and two stepsisters but we really haven't really discussed it that much either we should have by this point you know at seventy nine and eighty one but i guess we're just waiting to see what happens and then i guess we'll make a make decisions then uh-huh and uh but my stepfather's health is is failing bad you know i don't know if he has starting of Alzheimer or or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery he's been going down hill you know uh-huh and uh so anyway i uh by this time we should have probably made some decisions but we haven't so i i can see a lot of friends here in the neighborhood too uh one's mother just got to where she couldn't take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and all that kind of stuff she just wasn't doing it you know so she has come to live with her daughter in the neighborhood yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and uh you know i guess not that it's happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents uh-huh and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and it's you see all the different options and you see that they all can work uh uh-huh i've almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many mothers it's always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe they'll have a stroke or something and and then then they'll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first uh-huh well if they're uh that's the thing if they're physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children uh-huh uh the other side of that is that if the children are no where near where the uh parents had spent their life then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place uh-huh uh in this that you are unless that you develop new friends and uh the best thing is kind of a combination where uh the at least one of the children if not several are uh uh back in the area where the parents uh had spent their years and then that would make it easier yeah if if you were but like you say then to uproot them and take them to another state or something yeah uh-huh but uh in some of the cases i was talking about in the neighborhood though they have been up rooted from another state but then but then maybe things had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any more anyway you know uh-huh too uh they you know get to where they don't get out that much anymore maybe especially if they hadn't always lived in that area they're moving from yes well it's it's not an easy choice because it's but uh it's something that we all face and we uh right and then then it's then it's our turn so we better better handle it well because it will be yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents may not be as workable for us it it's certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh the uh the care is is not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems right and of course one thing we haven't even discussed that makes a big bearing on what you do is the cost yes you know if the parents if they are going into some kind of of nursing type home you know that helps helps them uh you know do they have the money to pay for it or are the children going to help out to make up the difference you know if there's two parents that might be three thousand right  okay do you have a boat no do you like to boat oh yeah oh yeah yeah i went and saw boat today i about flipped over it what kind i'm not i'm not sure what kind it was i saw it just sitting on the side of the road oh a ski boat though yeah oh yeah no doubt about it we have a seventeen foot invader yeah oh yeah and yeah it's we've only had it a couple of years but it's so much better than the other boat we had a an older trihold that was just horrible because i mean God you felt every wave but the uh the invader is really neat i really like it it's got the bow up and the bow down and all that stuff so it's kind of fun that sounds neat yeah so we ski every weekend well at least you have weekends off yeah we didn't i think i'd go nuts oh i know i know i don't have that luxury yet oh really yeah i am in the restaurant business i run restaurants and uh didn't really don't really have that time off yet so oh yeah that would be difficult where did you see the boat it was out out in out in Garland oh well there's been one sitting up in Addison for the last few days that's really neat it's a Baja but it's huge i think it'd be more boat than i'd want right now yeah this one's big too huh well eventually my husband thinks that we are going to sell everything that we own and live on a boat in the Caribbean oh that'd be great yeah i think we'd kill each other i think i could probably handle that well i think i could for awhile i do not know but yeah for awhile but i'd i mean i'd have to get away from him eventually but another friend of mine has said that he and his wife are going to do that and he said that they're just planning to take their bikes and then go into port every once in a while and say see you later and take off and he said that they thought they could keep their sanity that way well that'd be great yeah i do not know if i could live on a boat who cares about sanity though well i know what could make you insane floating around in the middle of the Caribbean i know it no telephone no fax machines nothing nothing exactly well that's another thing good thing about our boat is going out on the weekends at least we are forced to talk to each other and there's nothing to interrupt us and it's just so relaxing oh that's true so even if we do not ski but now that the water is warm enough we have been skiing a lot and my little seven year nephew is coming next week so i guess i will have to teach him how to ski well that's good seven that's about the right age yeah i think that's about when i learned yeah do you ski oh yeah oh yeah do you have your own ski and everything yeah i sure do oh yeah it's a lot of fun my husband has a wet suit so he can ski pretty much year around if he if he has the guts to but uh it was really neat last weekend we were sitting out in the in the boat and a a a school of shad came bebopping across the water and he threw the line out and caught a fish on the first cast oh really yeah that was really neat i had never seen the shad do that so that was pretty cool huh so anyway that's kind of different yeah i was amazed yeah i kind of i kind of enjoyed that boat i looked at today it's nice and clean it wasn't yeah it was not that old really did it have a cabin no it didn't it's open open up front had a little and it was open in the back too in the back kind of had a little yeah deck in the back of it also oh really yeah it was kind of different i thought huh it must've been pretty big yeah it was huh rather large i do not know how big it was or anything i was just looking at it and until i got around to the for sale sign how much was it uh fourteen thousand oh my i wonder how old it was was it very old yeah uh pardon me no it couldn't have been that old it's huh was it inboard outboard yeah you don't know how big the engine was no i did not even i did not even look at it i got around the price tag and said okay i said that's enough yeah well ours will be paid off in ninety three and i will feel like i hit the lottery then i guess but yeah i know it it's pretty nice it's nice to have it's a good way to get away Kyle is afraid that he doesn't want me to to pull it by myself yet but the way our drive way is there's like a forty five degree turn so i do not think i could get it out even if i wanted to um where do you all where do you all go skiing we go to Lewisville and but it's really nice i mean we've talked about getting the the slip so that if after work if i wanted to go out and play around in the boat i would have plenty of time because now it does not get dark until nine o'clock but oh i know it it's really nice having it in the garage because then if we want to go to Whitney or you know Grapevine or any other place it's just there and we can load up and go yeah that's true so plus i don't have any idea how much slip rental is it probably probably get a little expensive i would think uh somebody was talking about that at one time they were talking about uh was it one hundred fifty a month whoa something a hundred twenty a hundred twenty a hundred fifty a month oh i know it i think i'll keep it in the garage that's outrageous well it yeah it is and just to have a place to park you boat yeah especially on water even yeah with some wood going around it that's pretty wild yeah ev erybody's got to make a buck though oh that's true the name of the game i think well that's what we were coming back from Arkansas i guess last October and there was a marina for sale and he said now that would be a fun job but yeah i can probably do that for a while working around the working around the water and take off on the boat anytime you wanted to yeah yeah you know hang out the gone fishing sign yeah in it's truest sense right really i do not know a lot of people say boats are just a hole in the water that you pour money into but we've been real fortunate we have not had any problems so but Kyle's real good with the maintenance i think that that's real important so fortunately he knows what he is doing there well that's good does he know how to work on them or just minor stuff well just the minor stuff uh we took it in for its hundred hour check up and all that stuff but you got to do stuff like that to keep the warranties good yeah yeah that's true so that's fine i can live with that took took it in and got it got all of its shots right yeah it's kind of like our only child now right well hopefully someday you will get that dream boat and oh i know it or that time off one of the two yeah really yeah you kind of need need them to go hand in hand i guess yeah it helps it helps yeah because i mean i there's times you know even our weekends where we don't have time to go and it's sad because you think God you are paying all that money for the boat and it's just sitting there oh i know it so but it's well worth it when we do get to go and hopefully it will be good weather this weekend so we can go man it's supposed to be i hope so well i enjoyed talking to you okay maybe i will get you again sometime all right bye-bye myself all right take care bye-bye  so uh let's see what what was the topic i forgot oh oh we are supposed to talk advice for people taking for parents uh help their kids through college yeah do you have any children no i just graduated from college yes oh did you where did you go i went to Clarion Clarion uh-huh huh uh would you i mean if you had children would you want them to go to a certain place or um i would want them to make that decision and i would you know uh i pretty much made my decision on my own and my brother older brother likewise yeah uh-huh and uh you know we we were both pretty much happy with what we did so i think i would not push them towards any one place yeah uh-huh yeah i know i kind of feel the same way i i just finished college a couple years ago and i uh you know it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder but uh you know i went to a college that was fairly local and i feel like my education you know you get out of it what you put into it i think uh-huh but you know i know it's some people are real adamant about you know going to a certain school or whatever uh-huh i do not know i guess it a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something i do not know but yeah exactly i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is first of all they have to decide what they want to major in and then you know find a school that's good for that but uh-huh yeah is that why you picked the school you did or well i picked it for a couple of reasons it was only about an hour and ten minutes away from home so it was far enough away that i was away but yet close enough if i ever wanted to go home i could uh-huh yeah yeah uh so you lived there at school then pardon me you lived there at school yeah i lived up at school yeah uh-huh uh another reason was uh i paid for my entire education so i had to look for something that i could afford economically you know uh-huh right you know and uh Clarion was oh it was roughly around six thousand a year uh-huh and that was for tuition and yeah that was for everything and now i did not go out a lot and i did not order out a lot and i you know i did not spend money on myself uh-huh uh-huh but uh then again i was there for school so yeah uh and then another reason was i was not sure you know i always wanted to go to school for nursing and then at the last minute i changed my mind uh-huh and i knew that Clarion was known you know for two things actually for their they are known as a teacher's school uh-huh and also for their business so that's what i ended up going for is for business uh-huh for business so uh are you working somewhere then or no no not yet i am moving shortly so i am not looking around here oh i see where are you going to move to uh Maryland uh-huh oh are you do you have friends there or my fiancee is down there oh i see so does he work for a company down there yeah he works for the government oh i see oh the big company yeah so yeah i i have been working for TI for about twelve years i guess so uh-huh but i am not originally i am originally from Illinois but you know i have gone to college i guess a few different places but i think you know most for the most part you know the teachers have been pretty good and i have got out of it what i have what i have put into it uh-huh so but you know i think i think that's most of it personally but that's why i you know with my kids i think that you know i am just going to encourage them to go and i am going to try to help them financially but uh i think you know financially i am there's only so much i can do for them and i will say here's what you have got you can either you know go a couple of years locally and you know then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then we might be able to handle it but exactly uh-huh otherwise you can just go for four years you know somewhere and i will try to try to help you but uh i do not know you know the financial end of it like you said i put my wife through school too of course TI paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff but uh it still was a challenge to do and uh so i think you know financially that's that's one of the big aspects exactly yeah you know you it does have a lot of bearing on it whether you are paying for yourself or whether your parents are you know right yeah well did you uh since you were paid for school yourself do you think you had a different outlook on it like your grades and things like that uh yeah because i was paying for it myself i kind of slacked off because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted uh-huh i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me you know uh-huh uh they pretty much got to the point well well you know you are at that age and you are going to have to decide what you want to do if you goof up it's your fault it's not ours you know right right and then lets me go and i mean i did not do poorly i finished with a two five that's not that wonderful either uh-huh yeah but uh you know i i i mean i worked i did not you know goof around i worked it was just harder you know it was i do not know i was used to being you know on top and when i started there it was like you are mediocre so yeah right yeah well see i think you know i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it and and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too but if you if you grow to expect that you know you kind of go there as sort of a vacation uh-huh you know i that's the way a lot of my friends did it and you know they were not they did not take it very serious i know i took it real serious because i did not start to college until you know yeah i was about eight or ten years and uh you know out of what i should have been in school uh-huh but uh you know so i think that helped me be real serious about it and i i ended up graduating with like a three point six oh wow that's really good yeah so i you know and that was hard cause i had two kids and you know a family and everything else so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time but uh-huh yeah see well i screwed myself up also there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said what are you going to do and i said well i am going to go because i have not whipping butter the rest of my life you know yeah you are right exactly so i went and i just took business well being as i was paying for it myself you know i just kept you do not get into your major until like your second or third year uh-huh right and i am going into my third year and i decided well i do not want to do accounting anymore right uh-huh and i thought oh my God i am paying for this myself i am not switching completely because i will put myself a year behind so i switched to finance and i liked it better right yeah and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five you know in my last year my senior year uh-huh yeah but i would have really liked to go on uh secondary ed with math education but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself i was not going to put myself behind another year uh-huh right right well my my wife was sort of in the same situation she was she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go for uh-huh and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it uh-huh but you know by then she had practically got her degree so so you know exactly i think if uh i would have went with the math i think i would have done a lot better because i was more interested and that's what i i knew that's what i wanted uh-huh but uh i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two oh my gosh i would like to see the results on a study done i think they would do a lot better because they are more focused uh-huh yeah they know exactly what they want to do yeah i think i think you are right when you pull yourself away and then you get out and you say man i really need this uh-huh  okay all right well i am uh the product of uh i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother uh we come from a my mother and i were uh really practice first generation divorce in our family yes my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty seven uh-huh when i was seven years old and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known to have a divorce uh-huh uh-huh of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my father's side of the family and also uh uh uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth uh-huh right and they all felt that there there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce oh mercy uh it was always my mother's fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude yeah that that's too bad so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough um um that's sad it really is uh so you know that's so changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of uh-huh um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family uh-huh uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession profession in Des Moines Iowa that's that's wonderful she was a secretary to uh uh the judge as well as for him so that was a really high high status position she made over thirty thousand a year uh-huh well that's wonderful that speaks well of your mother well yeah she a real hard lady yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know she had high standards yeah oh bless her heart but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees and i am the director of music in a church um and but it's interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with challenges absolutely challenges that have to do with my sex uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions uh-huh right uh-huh as many of the woman as many of the men who are doing the same job i do and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man uh uh-huh so i am pretty i am pretty obvious pretty constant i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church so basically that's that's well i am done talking do you want to talk surely well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie and i can uh relate to that uh uh-huh uh i think it's it's the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh uh-huh the lesser of the two oh always and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to uh-huh like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snail's pace but we are progressing indeed so that's the main point is that we are going ahead uh-huh uh-huh and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh uh-huh men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways uh-huh uh-huh but there are a lot of die-hards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also uh-huh i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess it's fear i i mean what it could be if they are after they are not sure of themselves sure the one's that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves uh-huh and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level uh-huh and they do not have any uh ego uh problems that they are fighting uh-huh uh-huh and uh i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term uh-huh uh-huh uh and i what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh uh-huh uh-huh we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other uh-huh and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other uh-huh and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal men have a lot of trouble with that though uh-huh they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if that's i mean that's it's a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but it's just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man uh you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry it's always over control issues it's always over power issues it's never over you know it's always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about uh-huh uh-huh i think it's just i think it's just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh um the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands um and i believe that strongly um and uh but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is um and i think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict huh uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful wonderful way huh and if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that uh-huh uh-huh i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's true and uh that's really the the divine answer and and the right answer so uh uh uh-huh uh-huh that would be a beautiful relationship uh-huh it would be and i think there are some people that have done that and i have seen it and it's it's just marvelous and i am just in awe to see this uh-huh uh-huh  uh well let's see how many you said yours are all i mean that sounds like an army five oh lord that is an army i came from a family of six and i have only got two and they're one well any number is nice let me tell you well i kind of decided that single single children that that that's not parenting that's a hobby but yeah it's not as fair to the children either i don't think well don't tell that to all my friends they're into quality time i'm just into getting through the day oh yeah but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too well i i can i can spot a kid who really you know whose parents spend every quality time with them you know outside of the work day and when i take care of some people's kids you know when they when they have teachers' holidays and that kind of stuff i will take my friends' kids uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that are usually in day care and you can spot them because they have no idea how to just hang out and mess around uh-huh you can tell how to just entertain themselves yeah really yeah yeah it's a problem for any child and you take one that's used to being uh busy being having something to do all the time it makes a big difference it's not a problem for my two they're only eighteen months apart uh keeps you busy they can they can find things to do and mess around and and yeah plot and scheme and everything else so you did all five of yours complete college well that's great no our last daughter she didn't want to go to school she's uh but she's married now they built a home just a couple miles from us and well how did you go about selecting a college then well we didn't do it right all the time with our first boy we persuaded him to start here and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home i think the main thing is to uh right now i feel the main thing is to look at what they're interested in uh and take what they're interested in and then then start looking for schools do you think that what they say that they are interested in is at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately ultimately graduating at no not necessarily and but like our oldest boy i think he would have he wanted to go to Embrey Ray Riddle and we talked him into going local here first uh-huh and he only went a few months and then transferred to Pittsburgh he went to aeronautical uh oh just learning to work on engines and that uh-huh uh it has to do with airplanes and everything which is what his whole life is and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally and he would probably be flying is what he would be doing uh but but right now of course he's he's working for Pratt and Whitney in Connecticut and they build and rebuild uh jet engines how about the other four other three who went uh the other ones uh the second one she chose we let her go where she wanted to uh we didn't want her to go but she went to Erie to Gannan University uh or Gannan College i'm not sure which it is college i guess uh she went there two years and it was more expensive and she soon realized you know even though she didn't like Clarion she came back and finished at Clarion because it uh saved her quite a bit of money and she got really the same basic education that she wanted uh-huh and our other uh two boys they went to Clarion also and uh did very well there and they've all really got uh they've all really got really good jobs and uh when they were like in junior high and high school i mean had they did they have an idea that they were definitely going to go to college and uh-huh uh yeah they kind of had that they just expected to go Daphne never went she always said she would never go to college she said i i always thought she'd change her mind you know but she didn't and there's nothing wrong with that you know if college isn't for everybody uh-huh but uh it it does make a difference in your pay wage income i think it's what they want out of life because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are they can make a you know a much better income uh-huh like my kids they're all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state yeah i was i was making more than i was making three times what my father was making as an executive in the insurance industry when he retired you know that boggles my mind uh-huh uh-huh okay did you go to college yes i went uh four years undergrad at University of Nebraska at Lincoln because Lincoln is where where my parents lived and there really you did see it makes a difference uh-huh uh-huh there really wasn't a choice i mean the finances uh dictated that you had to go there uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i kind of i am not going to say i resent it but i was well one of the national merit scholarship qualifying and you know one of the Rhodes Scholars kids and the whole bit um uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh my parents didn't even discuss with me going to college out of state or anyplace else and i just knew that the finances you know would not support it if i had known someplace else uh-huh how not i'm not going to say easy but how much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a uh scholarship to go anyplace else i think that i uh-huh would definitely you know have gone now when i finished there then i got a scholarship to go to the Harvard University in Boston and that was uh i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened i mean i was uh-huh that's great taken out of my element you know the the the homogeneous Midwest which is a lovely place to grow up and put into someplace else where people thought differently looked differently sounded differently uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh different life styles yes yeah different life style and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me uh-huh now my kids i keep saying that uh you know i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could uh-huh i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to uh-huh you know them getting an education they really need a a you know a socialization away from what they are raised in especially if you lived a pretty insular community and uh uh-huh right an upper class suburb of Dallas let me tell you it's quite a bit different it's very different see that's the way w e are we're more of a rural type of a area and it does make a difference i they say you shouldn't look at the expense of the college when you are looking you should not yeah not really because they say a lot of times you get more help uh-huh with a more expensive college oh yeah and so in the long run if it's really what they want you know they're better off now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school uh we we did all we could uh-huh but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go  do you have any personal feelings on on uh the subject well uh capital punishment's a hard thing but uh there've been several there've been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to to go along with with that being the punishment given to to the people um-hum um-hum there have been some things you know i mean there's things done that are just so outrageous i know i know yeah that i i don't know how i don't really think there's any other way to deal with it right well i i guess my concern is what we're reading especially in Texas right now with them letting out the people out of jail as soon as they're out of prison when they do and then having them go right back and the day they get out they're back in crime and and especially when they're assaulting people and then killing people i mean the man that killed those three sheriff yeah i think that that that that's a really deputies he is out free walking the street i have a real problem with that yeah if it's a if it it presents a clear and present danger i mean it i think so but it's something that's really hard to deal with the way that our justice system is right now is basically set up in lawyers and and anybody will tell you that uh it is set up right now all the laws protect the criminal they're the ones with the rights right right they have the right to uh you know i think i watched something last week um well that evict uh i'm sorry the accused has the right to a speedy trial but the victim does not have the right doesn't have the same doesn't have the right doesn't have the same the same uh emphasis on those things as far as they're concerned so now the accused can can ask for delays and extensions and what do they call whatever they call them you know right right right and meanwhile the witnesses move and die and and and and and they and there's no one to face them exactly uh-huh uh-huh exactly a continuance continuance they can get continuances on for years before a a thing ever comes to trial and that makes the victim suffer more right right well they can't get any if the judge is going to have any award to the victim it just puts off their collecting it the yeah that too it's it's really bad it uh i um i think that uh you know that there needs to be a way that you know once someone has gone through you know a trial a trial i don't know how to fix it i mean it just seems like there there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made you know when someone has been um-hum um-hum um-hum a a time limit too don't let it drag on for fifteen years has uh yeah when someone has well even when someone has been convicted and i mean it's just so so abundantly clear that they did it right that appealing you know and continuing to appeal like four or five or six times to have convictions overturned and then they have to be retried and all that it's such a waste of time and energy and money and it just that's what keeps that's what's keeping all the the you know the the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time like this right uh do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the result this should be consequences of is capital punishment or or are are there some murders that committed that you think that leniency should be shown oh well i guess there's extenuating circumstances to anything like that um you know like i could i could see uh a first time offender being you know maybe in in a in a robbery situation trying to hold up a a store and getting scared and you know firing a gun and accidently killing someone okay i could see that that might be a situation where uh the person could be rehabilitated but i think just out and out murder and i'm talking about uh um-hum um-hum cutting people up okay you know where there's shown to be pathological tendencies where this person has done it over and over again in a serial fashion or whatever right that those kinds of things and any any kind of violent assault rape included um-hum needs to be addressed in in in that context hm and and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are because they have had them they have had them killed when they've well that bothers me that that bothers me a great deal i had a friend who was a police officer who was killed in the line of duty um um um and the thing that was the worst about it is that these that uh two of these individuals were uh well all of the individuals involved were very young one was technically a minor and so he was sent back to Mexico he was an illegal alien the other two had lived here they had graduated from high school here and they had told their teachers that oh that i mean repeatedly uh during high school they had told their teachers that they were going to be that they were going to to graduate from high school and kill cops that was their goal oh that was what they had told their teachers and so that's what they did and uh they were they were given i think oh absolutely that would be premeditated uh he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they uh several several things happened that night but they they beat him up and took his gun and shot him they killed him um um um with it and it was it was really terrible i mean uh i'd seen him like three or days before that um-hum we'd we've gone out uh with with he and his wife and that was really really disturbing uh-huh you know that that happened and that these people you know in the in the course of the trial you know came up with with all these you know things about well you know they were disadvantaged and all this stuff well nobody's that disadvantaged no well that's right there's no reason for murder no i do not care if you're poor or if you're rich or if you're ugly or if you're prejudice or uh what there that that's just beyond the and there's just no reason i mean no yeah i think so too and that's uh so i i do i do feel strongly about i think this giving excuses is pretty prevalent uh uh you i work in the school district and the all these kids they've they've got an excuse for everything and i can see it continuing on when they're adults yeah i just it's just a a a bad habit uh uh kids have got to learn from the time they're real little there's no excuse for for being bad or making bad choices deliberately or anything it's yeah it's it's uh i i i sometimes think if if i were on a jury and and had to make the decision could i and i like to think i could if like you if if especially especially especially violent um-hum crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a a child a child has been deliberately killed or the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decisions and still the people nothing ever happens to them right you know they stay in jail they get of f time for good behavior and stuff and they get released and they go right back and do it again uh-huh  hello hello this is Marilyn Spivey Richardson Texas uh Marilyn it's Angela i knew that was you well this should be a good one your mother will like it how funny let's see now what do i do push push one push one okay hold on okay are you there uh-huh well do you subscribe to any magazines yes which ones do you uh Soap Opera Digest is one oh how many soap operas do you listen to and uh just two mainly oh and so you can keep up with when you miss with that yeah well it was a special thing it i think it was like a free subscription um that you got to see if you'd like the magazine and you would renew it at the end of it i never did but oh i see do you subscribe to any others but we take Consumer yeah i Consumer Digest oh now we do like that one now what do you find out in that because i haven't read that one it it has all different kinds of uh tips on on like appliances and TV's and VCR's and cars um-hum just different things that you buy and and what the latest items are out and stuff it it's real informative oh uh-huh and then People magazine okay well i only subscribe to two one of them is People magazine um-hum and uh that usually has the latest oh people in the world very interesting and then i subscribe i bet you know what this one's going to be to the National Enquirer because it's good light reading some of it i wouldn't believe but i but it's interesting reading and believe it or not there are a few interesting articles in it too yeah i'd forgotten yeah they're i've i've bought it a couple of times that or one of the other ones like that one you know after reading the front page there will be something that just catches my eye and i'll go ahead and buy it um-hum because sometimes like you said not all of it is believable and if you use your own judgment you can usually decipher what is and what's not well it's good light reading and since our business is at the house i when i'm eating lunch i like to read one or the other you know comes in the mail once a week and and that's what i read when i eat my lunch but i really don't read that many i never do buy them you know like when i'm at the grocery store magazines much i guess pretty much after that it's the newspaper and just books do yeah yeah i don't i don't buy i don't buy then at the store either i can't even remember the last time i bought one at the grocery store in a long time yeah i used to years ago read like Ladies Home Journal and McCall's and some of those but i i just kind of stick to these two now but uh you know because they come to i do subscribe and they come once a week so you know they're and i don't really have time to read anymore right what don't you like about the magazines what you mean the two that i subscribe subscribe to yeah yeah uh oh well now i i guess i just pick out and read out of both of them what interests me there's an article about something way out in the National Enquirer or something i just you know i just don't read it i just read the ones that sound interesting to me usually about movie stars or famous people yeah yeah i i been reading all the stuff about Ted Kennedy i don't like all the advertisements and some sometimes it seems like the magazines are full of more advertisements than they are anything else yeah now that that's true there is a lot of those i don't pay any i don't read those much either i don't either it's just you have to turn all those pages to get finally to the story you were reading um-hum when it's interrupted but i like People magazine too yeah uh uh although it's getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to uh subscribe for a year it was like seventy five dollars and i'm this will probably be the last time yeah it is getting real expensive i'll just buy the ones off the newsstand then once a month or something when there's something i'm especially interested in reading about you know yeah or get somebody in the neighborhood to to do it and then everybody pass it through yeah that's probably what we should do like they they do books that way you know so uh uh-huh okay so does your mother still take People magazine they didn't renew their subscription because of that cost measure huh we all have to have those every once in a while uh-huh yeah well i think we're just going to do like you said just take the ones at the newsstand that that look interesting from now on because seventy five dollars for a magazine that's just that's too much that's right yeah they're all so much more than they used to be years ago years ago i think people read a lot more magazines yeah but uh i don't think people have time to read them anymore well that's true it's just usually the newspapers and and then they're off doing their own thing that's true weekends and stuff are pretty full and that's about the only time people seem to read on the weekends yeah yeah because mainly i i'm like you i read books uh-huh and and it's it's more as i can think more people do i think just read books more um-hum so well let's see if you were going to subscribe to a magazine which one would you pick other than the ones that are you reading um i don't know i i'm i just i don't i'm not that interested in the magazines it you know other than like People or this Consumer Digest and the reason why we got that one was you know it has good informative things in there for things your gonna be buying at at one time or other and you can save them and it's got like tax tips in it and stuff like that um-hum maybe the the other one there's one out that's that has to do with with financial things like how to save money and and what bonds and insurancers and stuff like that to buy that we've got we had a yeah sample subscription to that one and that one was was good too it had a the article the one that that uh was a sample one had an article article in there about college saving for your children and what to do and what not to do and how much the uh uh projected cost was going to be by the time like mine reached college age and stuff um-hum yeah and it's going to be pretty darn expensive and and it was saying you know what to you know how you could go about putting starting to save now yeah yeah like those E-bonds there's something called an E-bond that you can buy and it and it you don't have to pay taxes on it and it's for the child and then when they turn it in when it matures  there we go uh so uh what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary boy i i i don't know that's a that's a a tough one uh uh and it's uh i suppose it's it's changes as uh as perception my perception changes of of what uh i'm getting gypped on this week or this month uh uh that week right uh we're just uh going through uh uh well there's a couple of changes to the to the uh our health plan and uh and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance but uh um if i step back i'm not sure i'd i'd uh say that what what about you well um i uh right now i'm into a weird situation i'm a graduate student that that oh okay uh i don't have that many benefits per se yes um okay but but on the other hand one of these days you'll be out looking for a sort of get yeah yeah my wife has a real job and i simply see from her angle um uh i think health insurance is real real important yeah uh i've i've i've i've discovered i mean even in my case it's sort of they're really um a pain in the neck about it up here because the university makes me buy a small they they have a mandatory they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance yeah they offer insurance to everyone but then the basics that are major medical they they force you to buy here now i'm covered by my wife's anyway but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester right okay for uh mandatory so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case i'd rather that that went to something else and and yeah and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars semester uh you you never use because you just use your wife's right i mean uh and and and it turns out that actually uh the benefits they you know that that hundred dollars sort of would would entitle me to go to the university health services here you know and and use them and it turns out that i do think they're very they're excellent physicians there so through my wife's HMO we've registered for them as our primary care physicians so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the HMO for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank God um yeah but anyway uh otherwise i i would imagine uh good vacation is is important although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job i don't you know uh yeah i it uh the that that's a a negative about uh where where i am in that uh well i came out of uh i worked five years civil service and there it's uh if i remember right you well if they they accumulate it as hours per week or something like that and or hours per pay period or something but anyway it works out as i remember basically to uh you start at at uh two and a half weeks or something like that and it at three years uh it goes to four weeks i believe and i i'm coming up on i've been at TI now uh uh coming up on fifteen years and it and it just uh this year is going to go to four weeks here so uh uh yeah that's a that that is a a a negative but uh oh wow so that's the real but not probably not at probably not a deciding factor but uh yeah i mean i don't you know i don't i know my wife uh i think she gets you know about two weeks a year i guess but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off they you know usually let her yeah well that that yeah that's that's the thing is how how flexible they are for comp time kinds of kinds of things and uh uh yeah that's the the the uh yeah that's uh why it hasn't made all that much difference is because the with the civil service that you could take you could take your vacation in increments of one hour oh really and uh and but uh there wasn't uh anything as far as comp time so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year uh you know an hour here a couple hours there kind of a thing no yeah uh where as uh here i uh things are free enough to that uh the the actual vacation time per year probably isn't that isn't that much different but uh that's oh that's a but the yeah i think the i think the health insurance i think that's that's going through changes everywhere to uh the they've uh uh that's reasonable i think gone through a couple years ago here where they uh will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals and now they're in the process of developing a list of of uh designated doctors uh so that just routine visits uh they will compensate much better for if you go to their designated doctors which which uh my assumption is that that will not include my doctor since uh he keeps real busy without having to to uh yeah yeah weigh are see such of things yeah i think i was watching something the other day about that actually on uh a news special or something like that and they were saying how in some sense that that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and makes you know lowers the cost of everything and all insurance and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people you are talking to they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that so well and and i think in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh to some extent hospitals and doctors have some uh fixed amount and if if you don't work for somebody that's got enough clout to to uh uh give you you know give you these rates and make this agreement then uh you're you're not covered by that and and the added costs get passed on to you so uh i'm not i'm not sure it my uh um-hum right one of the phrases i use is that that it's moving towards uh private socialized medicine that uh in terms of the negatives of of of always heard in terms of socialized medicine you you have no choice on who you who you go to for a doctor and things like that uh where it's the government that decides here it's it's uh at least us who decides yeah uh and but it but it's the the same the effect is the same as the you you uh get left out of the loop more i i i know that their uh idea is that uh if if you have to pay a bigger share you'll you'll be more careful about spending the spending the money and and helping hold down the costs but uh i right i don't know in terms in terms of uh the health care uh i uh find that that uh although i've i've been lucky enough to never have any big problems but that that uh the cost is not a a big factor i want to i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me get better right you want to know that that when you pick a doctor you know you you could pick one who you could have some sort of a feeling about yeah that that's the yeah yeah and  well what movie have you seen recently Valerie let's see the last one we saw was Thelma and Louise oh we haven't seen that one yet well don't bother well oh from a woman's point of view and it was very uh oh it wasn't that good hey chauvinistic as far as women go uh oh it was it was entertaining but um yeah i don't think the general audience would would go for it oh well the most recent one that uh my wife and i have seen was the City Slicker how was that that was excellent it was just a really that is one i've been dying to see a really funny movie at the same time it had a story line about people trying to find themselves there were parts that were sad i mean it just ran the gamut of emotion uh-huh uh-huh and and but it was just entertaining all around entertaining how how long did that movie run uh it's still on to the best of my knowledge but i mean uh time wise how long was it two hour or oh uh it's i think it's less than two hours uh-huh okay okay i know we we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever oh that always seems to happen when you rent them you know yes but this one it was fairly long i i'm guessing probably an hour and forty five minutes maybe uh-huh uh-huh and uh it but excellent acting by Billy Crystal and Bruno Kirby uh was it oh good uh-huh who was the oh Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy oh great so we really enjoyed that oh well i'm looking forward to seeing that one that was next on our list so uh yes i think that uh i can highly recommend that movie this to see okay okay good deal good deal do you rent movies very often or yeah uh we generally rent a couple a week uh in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend you've got to rent it on Thursday right right that's exactly right it's so they get they get taken up at the store so uh-huh uh-huh we will rent two or three movies on Thursday and uh with luck you'll have one or two that are good better get yeah right right most of them are a coin flip oh oh God yeah yeah and we usually have oh we don't get out as much as we'd like we have two children so we occasionally get out to the movies but uh yeah it's it's fun it's a fun thing to do to get out and be entertained for once yeah well quite frequently we have our grandchildren on the weekends and uh we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see and uh-huh uh-huh and what ages are they have you found trouble finding movies for them or but uh uh generally we try to stay in the at least PG range the uh right the oldest is nine the youngest is three he doesn't really pay attention and the five year old doesn't have the attention span either but the yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh the nine year old will watch anything that's on TV uh-oh uh-oh yeah so yeah they have been doing that we've been waiting for a a good movie out this summer for the kids to see the last one they saw was Home Alone and uh they enjoyed that but uh i missed that one my husband took the kids to see that one so yeah my wife took the uh i think the kids to see that one but uh-huh we can generally find something at the store for them to watch yeah yeah well that's a good deal the uh oh we saw this movie Presumed Innocent was the one we rented uh last weekend Harrison Ford okay let me think if i have rented that one Harrison Ford and how does the story line go it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney and uh another prosecutor in the a woman prosecutor in there is murdered oh okay we haven't seen that one and he's trying to find it and it's of course it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her so it's and it's an extremely long movie it's over two hours long uh-huh uh-huh oh gosh oh gosh which uh my wife enjoy she likes the suspense movies i enjoyed it to a degree uh-huh i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me so i thought i better save that one for another day because it's save that for another day yeah because i think he'd like that one you enjoyed that one then yeah yeah i think you it's uh it's something i think you would enjoy yes it's uh-huh okay well that's a good one to put on the list it it's like most suspense movies what was it was on TV recently um Fatal Attraction uh-huh it's one that once you've seen it once and uh the suspense there is not really you really can't see it again so you know all the story and who did what and when it happened so right okay uh-huh uh-huh okay once once you seen one that's a suspenseful type movie like that then it's it's not good for a second watching particularly uh-huh uh-huh at least i don't think so yeah well yeah i don't think too many of them are anymore it's it's a shame but uh yeah i don't know we've watched Weekend at Bernie's any number of times it's just slapstick comedy oh no oh no oh sit there and laugh and my one grandson and i my wife can't understand it but we like Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure oh gosh you know it yeah we've heard about that one but we haven't seen that one either so well it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies which is another funny one yeah we like to laugh oh God oh i i have a theory i like movies for entertainment i don't want to uh go away depressed from watching a movie right right right i agree i agree life's depressing enough that's for sure well i've certainly enjoyed talking with you okay bye well you too Jim thanks for punching in and uh i hope you see a good movie soon have have a nice weekend okay bye okay bye-bye  okay i had uh just my last car i bought was a new one i ordered it from uh you know from the factory with all the little options and stuff i wanted on it all the goodies it was a Oldsmobile an Oldsmobile had you owned Oldsmobiles before yes i had i liked uh i had had a four four two and i when i was younger and that was uh quite a car uh-huh uh-huh and you what just the memory of that made you go to Oldsmobile again or uh well i looked around uh i think it may have had some influence i just liked uh this particular car it was a good buy i got it through the TI they had at the time the fleet purchase agreement oh yeah so that uh took a lot of the hassle out of it and uh you know i got all the things i wanted the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that um-hum are you still driving that car um-hum how old is it now it was eighty five eighty five are you going to be looking again soon or how long do you normally keep cars for a long time or well uh i am now i've uh i bought a houseboat and had other expenses so i'm not i'm not in the any position to be buying a car right away oh my uh-huh uh-huh although i was look like i might have to but because i had a little trouble with it i had to have a valve job and so forth done on it oh my seem to be running pretty good now was it still under warranty or oh no no this was just recently uh-huh uh-huh you put a lot of miles on a car or uh yeah i do a pretty good bit i've got about ninety six thousand on this one here oh my for what almost six well six years huh yeah i drive about eighteen miles out to the plant and back um-hum um-hum each day i mean each way thirty six miles a day well we don't we don't buy new cars that often we drive them you know until they get maybe seven or eight years old and then we'll what we'll do is sell off we'll have one about seven say and one twelve or thirteen years old and we'll get rid of it and then we'll uh-huh buy a new one and and uh i guess right now we have a a seventy eight Chevy wagon and then a a four year old uh Crown Victoria that i love and you like Fords huh uh-huh well my husband's my husband got to chose choose the make and then i got everything else uh-huh uh he he he likes Fords and my youngest son still lives at home he's in in college but he drives an old Ford seventy seven Ford pick up yeah that he loves but no i this was the last year they made the big Crown Victoria and before they started chopping it up and making it look ugly so i it look i i guess some people think it looks boxy but oh yeah always like to to have a room in a car i'm not into compacts i like yeah that was uh something you can relax in something we uh were interested in for our kids while they were learning how to drive was a pretty good size car although two of them decided on trucks pickup trucks right well that's not that's a good choice for a child i think to start to start to drive in yeah our oldest one started in a old Datsun of ours but our second one uh bought a real old i i guess it was a Olds ninety eight but it was one that was still metal before they brought in fiberglass and we she was such a nervous driver we felt like she's probably better off in that you know if she if anything did happen she was going to be all right but yeah that's well that's true i mean they uh they should have a little car around them not well just for safety's sake yeah and i don't know i i look at the new ones on the market now and the the bodies are so sleek i guess for wind resistance you know and and uh they just don't look like they're roomy inside i guess they are i haven't been looking at them to plastic yeah well there's a lot less room in this one i have than the earlier ones i've had yeah this is supposedly a oh really i guess they call it a midsize car but uh-huh is it supposed to seat six yeah it uh well no it's a it's got bucket seats in the front and you can fit you can fit five people in it uh okay a lot of knee room in the back or it's fair uh um-hum nothing anything like your Crown Victoria yeah just you know you can sit in there and it's it's reasonably comfortable right right i don't sit back there very often well i even even in our car i know like when my husband and my sons and sons-in-law all have long legs they're tall people and so if one of like my husband's driving then he soot scoots his seat back yeah me too and so we can't put a we can't put a tall person with long legs behind him same here six i'm six foot four so so it oh my word yeah you're like my son-in-law yeah no that's so you can't then then like i could sit in back because i'm only five four so my legs would fit well fine back there but you couldn't put a a real long legged person back there comfortably that influences my car purchase decision too because i can't really get in a lot of these Toyotas and Hondas and stuff right w ell well yeah i wonder sometimes you know we have the Dallas Mavericks here that play and they'll show them sometimes on TV and they've all got these real low sports cars um-hum maybe yeah well now sports cars they have a lot of room for your legs you know you kind of sit lay and i well i've never been in one so i but i'm always wondering how on earth somebody six seven six eight getting into those little old things you get into a little more of a reclining position they must because i don't know where they're going yeah yeah their feet go way up under i've driven a Camaro i mean uh yeah Chevy sports car Corvette and Corvette yeah well even to get out of it though i mean you're you're only a foot off the ground at the most you got to that's true and it's got to be you know you can't get your leg out and so i i thought i always you always see them standing by it you know if they're advertising they don't ever show them getting in and out yeah yeah right and i thought that's the part i'd like to see is them getting in or out the unfolding and folding act right well listen i never had a car that's had the swivel seats that where you can like when you're wanting to get out you just turn it to the side and then your feet are no i haven't either and and i don't even know if they i know for a while back i saw them advertise that and i thought that might be kind of a neat looks like a real good idea to me a neat thing to have but i i for some reason they don't carry them and i don't know if they found they were unsafe or hum you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable yeah one thing our does our car doesn't have that i'd look for in another car is that that little gutter like it runs so that when you open the door the water doesn't just come off the it doesn't have that so when you open our car door it comes the new the new one does yeah um-hum so they i guess that's the year they learned that's not a good idea because it just comes right off the roof and straight down and just you know i try to put an umbrella up there but that doesn't help too much it just so i get the interior wet and i don't like to do that just along the side there well you all don't get as much rain near Plano as we do here i'll bet well i i don't know we sure been wet this i never seen a spring like this how many inches do you all average a year huh how many inches do you average a year oh i don't know but we're way we must be way above average this year because it's been terrible just rain rain rain you just have had a lot yeah is it is it uh kind of a dirty rain you know i i've never been down in there but you always here how polluted with all the oil no we're no it's not it's not huh-uh it's just rain well i i didn't course no it's uh i don't think it's any particularly polluted here i mean you can i guess if you went uh if you went over by the refineries and stuff you might oh it is up here too it is everywhere but with all the oil right right that's where i was thinking of no that doesn't that doesn't that doesn't affect huh-uh no we never notice that over here we live on the northwest side ah then you don't have any trouble with the water or hi there mister Colombian just had a friend come back from Colombia oh my well i just i i don't know i you know i just hear that when you read about Houston seems like they're course all their advertising or not advertising but news reporting is maybe an oil uh-huh refinery blowing up or something like that you don't ever i i need to get down that way i guess sometime when i retire they have a see what they have well yeah it's not that far i know my grandchildren keep me landlocked they have a they have a they have a uh big you know it's a big complexes all around the ship channel over on the east east side of town southeast uh-huh uh-huh other than that you know it's a nice clean city real modern hum hum yeah i that was where they had when the economy went bad a couple years back they had all the limousines for such good buys yeah we had one of our principals at our of a school here in Plano an elementary school went down and bought one uh-huh i think she paid eighteen or twenty thousand dollars for a limousine and she's still driving that thing around and they tease her um just just you know to see her drive up in front of the school everybody wonders who it is yeah never heard of limousines being a good buy know we had plenty of real estate though it was just a well they they just said you can you know the limousine companies were going out of busy and and you could pick one up for oh yeah oh i guess that's true yeah for a real good buy and they had supposedly in Houston they had a lot of them so i thought well that i don't know we even debated about that at that time but decided no that wasn't the that wasn't the route when our kids were little we had a van which we loved for for traveling we had four kids and they just that allowed them to really move around oh yeah we did we had  okay so uh during the summertime do you dress differently than than you would when school's going on um a little bit during the school year we're um definitely expected to wear hosiery and you know things like that although we can wear slacks yeah oh really um during during the school year and of course that's a good idea because i do sit on very low chairs to read stories to kindergartners and oh yeah you know so it's pretty important to um i also like very much the new split skirts oh yeah you know because then you've but those aren't that new i mean i have some that were way old yeah oh that's oh that's true the old culottes that's right but those are just real comfortable and um you know allow you the privacy and all oh yeah yeah they're very nice do you can you get away with wearing the shorter ones style the ones that really look like shorts kind of the only uh no i think it needs to be longer probably if it's split it it varies though between the principal from one principal to another yeah yeah there are some like um some principals insist that you not wear um anklet type shorts oh yeah i mean socks um that you have to wear hose you know hose but i know of other schools uh-huh where they wear um you know anklets and yeah well my husband was laughing at me one day because my dresses i when i dress to go to work my dresses are pretty long and um um-hum i couldn't find any hose one day but i found some knee highs so i put those on and the wind caught my skirt and he said what have you got on um-hum how embarrassing i know i hate that you really have to check on the yeah it was real funny check on the length well we wear the knee high ones a lot too so yeah it's pretty comfortable i had never done that and i just i could not find any hose anywhere so the one day that i did it and i got caught do you wear um suits very much um no i really don't my don't i work for a computer company but it's not uh real visual i mean it's not like an IBM where you have to wear your blue suit um-hum yeah right but um i can get away with wearing dresses a lot which i really enjoy um-hum um-hum because especially i mean you know it's nice sometimes in in a suit because if you're hot inside or cold or you know whatever you have your jacket but uh i'm more comfortable in a dress um-hum yeah so but i am too and i the best thing are you from Texas uh i've been here seventeen years oh well you qualify but i'm from but i'm from Illinois oh well see that's what's so funny because so many girls move down here from the north and they have these heavy wool suits and it's like God what do i do with that that's right that's right i said well that's the best part about Texas you can buy uh one dress that you can wear pretty much all through unless like it's the like two cold months and winter in December that's right right all right that really is nice i um i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes and i i mean i still have some sweaters that i had you know from before i moved down here things that were were wool or just you know really nice things and yeah and really very seldom get to wear them and should certainly get rid of probably all of them um-hum but like i said i'm kind of a yeah but you'd have to go back to Illinois to have a garage sale yeah that's that's really true because who would want it down here but anyway they they still sit around in drawers and boxes and i i get them out really hum at the beginning of the winter yeah out of a box and put them in my drawer and then at the end of the winter i take it out of the drawer and put it back in the box and sometimes i never wore it now that is silly isn't it well that's really weird because last winter i bought my first cardigan that i ever remember buying and i only got to wear it like twice all winter long so yeah are you from here then well yeah Oklahoma and Texas so i mean Oklahoma did get colder in the winter but um i guess i just didn't notice it because i never really dressed very warm so um-hum well the thing is that you know it it does get cold but it's just such a short season you know and you just yeah yeah can't wear that much well and i found a new dressmaker so that i just am crazy about the style of the dresses so oh how nice i've been yeah i mean i go into every store and i i go do you have Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit dresses and they look at me like i'm strange but Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit it's called Rabbit Rabbit Rabbit and they are the neatest dresses they just are very flattering to your figure and um huh where have you found them um i've been fortunate i've found them in in a catalog and then they're a lot cheaper than you can find them at Dillard's um but they carry them at Dillard's so um yeah they do have them at Dillard's and hum i'll have to look at those that sounds interesting yeah i really enjoy them i've gotten i've and it's real funny too because i've had a lot of compliments on them when i wear them so um-hum um-hum well you mentioned that you liked the long skirts and i i really do too i just i don't know i'm really comfortable in yeah w ell i'm short and i've been told that if you wear the longer skirt it gives you it it gives you more of an elongated look um-hum so um i've always been more comfortable in the longer ones um-hum i like that too yeah so my my husband's kind of whiny he says well i like the shorter ones and i'm like well yeah you don't have to sit with your legs crossed all day long that's real good very well that's exactly right so oh well but anyway but i don't have any play clothes because i spend all my money on clothes that i wear to work for work so on the weekends and well you you work year round right yeah yeah but it's just kind of frustrating because on the weekends you want to go out to play and you don't have any play clothes um-hum so i need to kind of acclimate my wardrobe to a lot of skirts and shirts i think where then that way i could at least wear the shirts on the weekend um-hum that's true put them with my shorts or something yeah that's true well i have more summer stuff i guess for that kind of casual because we do go on a um i go back to Illinois and visit my folks for a week and then we go out to the east coast to visit my husband's um mom and family and we usually go to the beach while we're out there so yeah uh in fact i was thinking this summer that since i'm doing summer school i haven't worn hardly very many of those things but i was thinking oh well i got to get them all together so to take them on our trip yeah well i've lost weight recently so i'm now getting to dig out the things i haven't worn for a while so that's kind of fun oh how nice well i took i went through my closet this spring and i i took some stuff out and put it in another closet in the guest bedroom because i'm so tired of looking over it and it's all just a little bit too tight yeah but it isn't so much too tight i mean i could easily well maybe not too easily but i could lose that weight and then they would all fit fine and you know and there are things that i really don't want to get rid of you know i really want yeah to keep them because they're nice and so i thought well i'll put them in there and then maybe i'll feel so bad that i can't wear them now uh-huh and i'll do something about it but so far yeah well that's something my husband says what are we going to do when we finally do have kids and you have to move out of one of those because i i have both of the guest bedrooms are both my rooms and it's like what are we going to do oh that's funny said well we'll have to get a bigger house yeah that's right hey when you have kids you definitely have to have oh i know and then plus well my sisters have had their children and so now they send their baby clothes and all their stuff down here to me and i'm like well what am i going to do with all this stuff oh i don't think it will fit my dog you think they're hinting yeah they definitely are but it will be nice if we ever do have kids because then i've got the whole wardrobes and fortunately she's had a boy and a girl yeah that's right ooh yeah you'll be glad believe me oh because i so that worked out yeah sure i will be because God i was in was in Foley's the other day and i turned the wrong direction and i ended up in the little kids' clothes and i just picked up something for my niece and it was just it was like thirty bucks i thought golly um oh it's just unreal the time though that it really gets the worst is um is when the kids get old enough that they really care what they're wearing oh yeah i can imagine my kids are twelve and fifteen oh and um you know they're both boys so they're probably not as picky as if they were girls but on the other hand they can be pretty picky and you know yeah i mean i could get away with you know with it not costing nearly as much you know when they were littler because um-hum they didn't care yeah definitely anything was fine but you know now it has to be a certain kind of certain kind of jeans and the the shoes are just about the worst oh God yeah i can imagine uh gee um my son just came out the other day and he's his what is it i think they're Reebok uh-huh whatever my other son has Nike Airs at the moment but these Reeboks oh and i was thinking he bought them in March it was early March he bought them and they are demolished i mean they are absolutely demolished there are pieces hanging off of them oh my gosh the inside of the sole on the bottom has fallen out i mean that's how worn out they are and they cost i bought them on a wonderful sale at Mervyn's they must have been thirty five or so percent off they cost sixty dollars uh-huh wow on sale on that much of a sale oh my gosh and my husband and i were just talking you know it's i mean we're talking minimum of three of those a year oh my gosh that's a hundred and eighty dollars a year for hi s tennis shoes oh my gosh you know and my husband maybe i won't have kids oh it's just awful and my husband bought i mean this year he bought a pair of of really good you know work leather nice men's dress shoes and they were about a hundred and fifty dollars or you know something like that and you know he said i felt terrible spending that amount of money on this pair of shoes he said uh-huh wow but i'll be still be wearing them in ten years yeah and and he's i mean we're talking a just a piece of rag oh no so anyway i just can't imagine before we go visit grandma yeah really well my mother had three girls but i don't remember being that picky about my clothes  well Hal what's uh what's crime like in Dallas well it depends where in Dallas you are there are certainly parts of town uh-huh i would not want to live in yeah because it's a situation it is very location dependent uh-huh and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire oh yeah yeah in Baltimore we have similar i live on the outskirts of Baltimore and uh we live right outside the city and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though i'm in graduate school uh i live here because it's close to the university but you know we have uh it it's really funny the only crime we really see uh-huh is uh just the kids being malicious uh-huh you know and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around that make sense yeah that uh the what they call the latchkey children yeah yeah something like that no one's you know or or fathers are just missing you know so there's no uh no consistency there in the home or whatever there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong you know you know the suburb i'm in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand uh-huh uh-huh uh we get the uh affect of the the city and uh-huh uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes yeah a small number of assaults uh well if we have one murder a year yeah that's probably as many but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately um-hum uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day yeah yeah i think that's we're about the same in Baltimore though um Washington i think is uh close by and you know they experience a lot more i think they definitely have more problems that uh uh-huh in in the area what what do you think can prevent crime well uh the thing is i don't it's one of those things where if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are uh-huh inverse of what they should be like uh wherever there are more uh criminals there are more policemen but that's which came first yeah yeah but on the other side of it is it's it's basically the the problem is within the in the society and the society's views uh-huh and uh well since now i'm in my mid forties when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation that's developed with the uh-huh yeah the drug aspect of uh yeah i think uh-huh uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts um yeah i i i think i agree with you there yeah because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that uh-huh uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that there is a lot in the society where things have changed uh so it's effected all of us uh-huh yeah i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems yeah our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should uh legalize drugs uh-huh because it would eliminate the uh the violence and the uh the under the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense he's one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so it's um uh-huh and he was a District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so that's a really stranger you know it's a different viewpoint i uh you know in a sense i don't i'm not i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh yeah uh it would certainly be an interesting test uh-huh but the other side of it to me what happens if we lose worse uh you well the other side is that unfortunately yeah some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life right uh society didn't try to then save themselves from it they let this person um-hum who had ruined it uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that right yeah their life expectancy was real short but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves yeah they have induced it themselves yeah that's true and so to me that's i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then don't use them uh-huh uh-huh well i think you know they did that in Alaska uh that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana uh-huh but i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus that's such a that's not a true um you know it really couldn't be a good test because Alaska's so different than every other part of the country uh-huh you know so that but that was interesting you know i i don't crime is one of those things that's uh i i don't know you know the drug culture the uh the um you know i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it yeah well the some of that and of course i'm a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that i'd remember that much from the fifties but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality yeah uh-huh yeah that's true that's true we worked hard for everything that's very true and so you know in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays there's so much on TV where uh-huh where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course uh-huh uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and you know there's a million dollars you can have uh-huh uh for mental duress or whatever yeah but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable right and yeah if you're going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is uh-huh we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme and we mean it yeah yeah that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on uh uh and i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and um uh-huh uh-huh that was a very uh that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties uh-huh and uh everything we did and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago there was no his father was even the uh police chief of the town uh-huh so there was no repercussion at all uh-huh you know other than insurance but he was uninsured so uh our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it yeah and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere and they came and questioned us uh-huh yeah you know and but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving right was uh misplaced for years that you know uh-huh yep it was an acceptable social behavior uh-huh yeah very much so yeah that those are some important points yeah i that's those are what are what does your city have for gun control if anything well see Maryland is one of the most we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland i i think  well Nancy uh as as i was talking my brother uh his name is Ainsley and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center oh uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know John Phillips Sousa and uh all of and Franco Goldman in fact the name of the uh the band was because one of the famous uh march composers of all time uh Richard Franco Goldman and his son Edwin actually i may may have those reversed father and son started the band like seventy years ago i think so it's the oldest organization really of it's type in the country and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years oh that that must have been wonderful were you able to hear so well i was able to uh to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a a concert there and uh it was quite enjoyable um yeah sometimes in that uh he also had one of the composers well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also oh so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand and that was when i realized how good he really was was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of uh working with the musicians and and one of his biggest struggles uh with the band was that this was all union musicians oh which didn't give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band uh he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad well um actually that lead into a couple different things um my dad worked with unions um for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but um my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go to a lot of different um kinds of musical events um i grew up in Detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range of things um one of the regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to find out um who the composers were or it it was just always there and there were certain things that um i liked so much but i still have trouble to this day sometimes i will recognize a passage but i'll have no idea what it's from or whose it is and um over the last few years oh and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um that's something that i regretted but um when you mentioned the band music my uh-huh son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year uh-huh with marching band and i really enjoy band music um it oh yeah i i was in the band in high school and that oh what instrument did you play i played the clarinet oh i like that a and uh so i i did that my all through high school and then i guess my first year in college i played but it wasn't a marching band it was just a it was a symphonic band and uh ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department oh and i was i was in the symphonic band that was actually part of the music department and i thought that was pretty unusual yeah what uh my husband Tim played a trombone in high school and he also played in a a band in college not marching band but oh symphonic and that was really the first time that i got to hear a lot of the um band music and some of the wonderful composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and right so i've enjoyed this so much um with our son now doing that and he plays tuba so i don't don't get to see him when he's doing um uh-huh a tuba tuba concerts we just see the top of the bell at the back but in marching season he's easy to pick out right well does he bring the tuba home to yes uh oh my goodness we uh laughed when they're in sixth grade and they try them out on instruments and try to find the appropriate instruments we thought of suggesting that they ought to also find out what vehicles the parents drive because uh the tuba and the sousaphone don't fit in in every kind of uh car yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp oh and she found the same thing that uh she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then uh uh a harp became available which there are just not very many instruments uh and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived in in uh Missouri at the time and they actually drove to Colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized station wagon uh so they'd have room to bring it home and that's dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp yes that she plays uh well i uh because of my brother's uh work with music for a long time he was a uh a critic for the Music Journal and as a result of that he well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album uh library or collection which i have now inherited and um oh i i don't listen to in nearly enough it's the same sort of thing there's so much music that i recognize but don't who is yeah who is the composer but i've based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a a uh two thousand album classical record collection now oh gosh so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years God if i wanted to at this point but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music yes most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room but uh anyway um well he must have collected that over a period of years well he really did uh i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in New York City he had um we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir College hum and you know he did not finish high school he just went straight straight to Westminster s o i never really remember having lived at home with him and after he did get out of college it was not long he before he uh just moved to New York City knowing that that's where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world and um became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties uh when he was doing that i've seen that date a good bit on the uh on some of the albums because he would typically uh sign and date everything that i think everything that he owned he did that with but certainly all of his albums and all of the music uh he had signed and dated i was going to ask you and it seemed that there must have been a big gap um i also have a brother who's thirteen years older and one who's nineteen years older you you don't run into that very often my goodness you have one that's nineteen years older uh-huh my goodness that is a wide spread well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between but uh because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old yeah i mean other than that uh i don't even ever remember living in in the same house with him at all oh i'm glad you got to go and hear him in New York though that um that must have been very special well it was it was thrilling um my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that we'd seen him conduct that particular group which he'd been with so long she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall before oh um and i'm not sure it was probably the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was uh in New York City that was Stokowlski's orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for quite a while and it at one point did in fact uh uh conduct there at Carnegie Hall so she got to see him there and i i didn't  okay okay well i uh i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers i'm not a lawyer uh that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure and i i look at it more from the civil side of things that juries have any sense of of the value of and worth so that they have real problems when it comes to uh uh they can find guilt or innocence right uh but then when you quantify things and that might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate uh that they might leave it to somebody else who uh has expertise in that right i agree too i don't think the jury should be the ones that that put the sensings sentencings down i think the judges should or even a panel of of lawyers if if it got to that point might be better apt than just regular civil people uh-huh not knowing you know exactly what things are from from murder on up to like tax stuff you know yeah because i find that uh i've been on a few juries and uh as a say i i tend to be around uh civil cases because i've been an expert witness some and uh many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to uh come up with the fair value uh or the fair sentence and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is uh you know the range of of possible values or terms or you know how heinous was the crime right uh that uh when i only do something one two or three times i'm hardly an expert on it and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three yeah and and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was a you know worth five years or twenty five right that's yeah and and and most people that do sit on juries some people just sit on them once in their lifetime you know if they're that lucky sometimes or you know what whatever the case may be and and may not have any idea um-hum of what what the standard punishment would be for it and it they may have some different idea i mean it might be more important for them to put a sentencing sentencing sentencing down that was uh yes longer you know that didn't fit the punishment didn't fit the crime um-hum or not long enough or you know whatever the case may be yeah i i think the judges do have that that better knowledge of it the only thing i worry about sometimes is if if you get somebody in there that that has a name that is the defendant and you know sometimes might have have more pull which that does happen i mean we we can't say it doesn't because it does happen i mean not everybody is is you know um-hum has has the right morals sometimes and people can be paid off or politically or um-hum whatever the case may be and sometimes that's not real fair either though so well one of the others things that gets me on on the juries is that often in the newspaper i i tend to hear two things well that go on one is you often see in the headlines the big numbers um-hum uh and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences or get changed right by a judge or an Appeals Court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines uh and we don't have uh again a lot of knowledge so we don't know what is really going on what is uh really the range of sentences or awards that are uh are actually uh in the end applied right right well well also what i don't think is fair either is when you have like a say a rapist come in and and his attorney gets his sentences sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge like i don't know what assault or something or um-hum but which that doesn't make any sense to me either i know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot and and and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't i mean it's embarrassing and all this other stuff and they they're put on like um-hum they were the ones that caused it or whatever but to me when you do the crime then you should pay for whatever you did and and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge i don't i don't think that's right because all's that's going to do is say oh well you know that was a breeze i can go out and do it again and you know yeah have the same thing happen that's that's not right well that's where uh uh the role of juries is is restricted and uh i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it one is it's restricted in the sense that juries only decide the charges that are actually uh brought you know if it's first degree rape second degree degree rape or whatever right they only get to decide on that well okay this person has been charged with first degree rape uh and you can decide guilt or innocence on that uh such like maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's uh premeditated or um-hum one or two of the lesser degrees and the other thing that juries are restricted on and and at least to me this has been one of the frustrating things in my even in my own experiences that you usually don't get to hear all the information it's what information is presented and yeah uh i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards but often juries hear only a fraction of the of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence and to me how can you how can you make a decision if you don't have all of the evidence in front of whether it be whether it pertains to the case or not somebody thinks it it had because they've got it there um-hum so the lawyers the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information don't they yeah and the truth that's brought out is uh as i say when i've heard about you know the oath is to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth is that they want uh they don't want uh the whole truth i mean you can say yeah the because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the of the truth they only put part of it yeah right well that's just like that old witness game well it's a game kids play too but um somebody did it just ah just for your train of thought where they they showed something and they asked there there there were uh like four people  okay we're on okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think i don't think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um i don't believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe it's probably bought across the market and i don't think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all so uh you're you're for no restrictions or uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say if a criminal if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i don't think it would hurt anybody to wait a week uh-huh to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out yeah right and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them from other means i what kind what what kind of means would those be oh i don't know like from each other you know uh uh-huh in other words you're saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns i think so well doesn't it doesn't doesn't London have a ban on firearms England jeez now i don't know yeah don't they carry don't their policemen over there carry these billy clubs that's right nobody over there carries guns yeah i don't know if we could get away with guns completely i guess well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when they're dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them that's right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um and i don't intend to buy one and i'm not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i don't believe in hunting either so you know well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know won't know how to handle it right and uh probably never will do me any good because the bullets in one place and the firearm's in another uh-huh and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course i'm like you i don't like to kill things no i don't either well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason so oh yeah and and there's a lot the crazies are out there in numbers right right well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and i'd have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point hm and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country in this country yeah then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms uprising you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms i don't think we ever will i don't either that's the problem not in this country yeah so somewhere somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh what's the organization that uh right that the rifle association oh yes the gun the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever yeah well i think we ought to have some yeah well i think so too so i'd have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms right i could go for that like like you suggested yeah i think that would i think that's the only way okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then well i've enjoyed talking to you well same here and uh one of these days that name's gonna come back to me oh me me too okay bye-bye okay sweetheart bye-bye  all right and and your occupation is teaching i'm a i'm a substitute teacher is is this Pat i'm talking to now yeah i'm a substitute teacher in i believe the same school system we both work in substitute teacher yes it is it is uh-huh right well i was just trying to make an introduction here oh okay but oh and and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year now oh i've just gotten a another job at an elementary library at Barron well i bet you're you're you may dress differently then for that right i well not really i've got the every day i've got to uh read to kindergartners so i'm going to be down on the floor with them i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be doing working with every day for uh you know a half hour so i'll be i'll probably be wearing slacks as often as i do because i'm i'm if i'm going to be down on the floor messing with them i'm not going to wear nylons and you know nice nylons and dresses well what i wear sometimes depends on on how cold i think the school might be or what room i might be in since i'm a sub and have different rooms to go to and always carry a sweater right well of course you've been at Clark enough that you know it's always cold yes but you don't know uh i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there you know you try to layer so you can add or or or take off subtract right and it's it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual uh i i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools that's one of things one of the things i ask about you know whether whether she would allow slacks and she said she doesn't have a problem with that she just didn't like sloppy dressing uh-huh and and i said well you know that was okay and i'm basically i just you know i wear slacks year round except every about once a week i try to wear a skirt and and in the winter you know i just add a maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer and add a heavier jacket or you know wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer uh-huh that's about i don't i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and you know look really right and well for me sometimes they even have dress up days or they you know have have spirit week that that you wear your different outfits and you have to have the color for that particular school if you if you choose to participate in spirit week yeah right right and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some sort of hat and you never know that though sometimes when you're going in do you no but because i sort of stick to several schools uh i'm usually aware that there might be a spirit week going on and and might might remember to do it and then many schools on a particular day during uh right right i guess football season maybe all year long they wear the school colors for uh game day which right on what Thursday Thursday right it might be Thursday for the high schools and it may be Friday for the senior high schools right right so that would kind of give you a clue i guess and and sometimes you get the long term stuff so you're aware ahead of time yeah of what's going on that so that's and i don't know you know i i think about well the dress code they have for the kids you know are they put one on the parents or the teachers and say they have to the men have to wear ties and there can be no blue jeans worn and because some of the teachers i know wear uh dress up jeans not sloppy looking jeans but tapered jeans that they've had dry cleaned so they have got the crease and uh you know they'll wear it with a nice top and and uh uh-huh i don't know that that looks that bad but if you're going to tell the kids they can have to dress up i guess you can tell the teachers that too yeah it it i see that the i think the elementary school teachers or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than than some of the high school teachers i think uh-huh but it i think it varies it it just so much anything anything can go uh-huh and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools like history at Clark they're all pretty fancy but they're just sort of into clothes and then there's other departments that aren't and they'll just wear your common ordinary you know whatever you might right right right yeah there's a couple teachers up there that that do dress up more than others right might say right and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them right well and you always course it's a standing joke you know when the when the men come in in a a tie and a suit coat you say you know what have you got a job interview today or there there's or you're going to be observed there's usually yeah there's usually something going on that that uh and would would uh cause that to happen and i i don't know how a coach would feel if that teaches health or yeah English you know English or whatever that they had to wear a tie i some of those male coaches that might really right they go around in their little coaching shorts or parachute pants right and a T-shirt right that i didn't ever understand i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period so yeah well at Vines the coaches don't do that they they dress pretty good i would say and then they go to their coaching and they they put their shorts on there whether change then well see that's what i would think uh-huh that's what i would think but they they don't look you know they don't wear their sweat pants or or anything they're they dress like any other teacher would in in a classroom situation not in PE right course we had had one coach one period he'd teach PE and the next period Health and then a period of PE and and that's hard you know so he just left warm-ups on but those i can understand yeah but uh no i think really probably they could they could uh really and i don't know if if they put make uniforms the thing for the kids i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top and i don't think we'll ever get to that no i don't think i think we're going the opposite direction it's the parochial schools that i guess many times they've had uniforms for years i really don't really know if they still do you don't think so well some of them yes they do and and it's not at some of the private schools but even there's a couple public schools in Dallas where where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers you know dress in accordance with that it certainly makes it easier to dress uh-huh well it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run i think that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe uh-huh well i i think it would make a difference at school i i don't think we should be spending time saying somebody's wearing torn clothing or wearing shorts too shorts too short or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high you know i mean uh-huh it's a lot of trouble to to take care of that and of course the kids say then why bother just let me wear what i want and and yet we can't to that either i'd like to see them go to to not necessarily a uniform but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt you know that would that would alleviate any T-shirts with sayings on them but if they could wear a button-down shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy th em anywhere they wanted and you know and yeah but i doubt that that would come about that that will come about just i yeah i i and then the girls could right i don't no not in Plano no not yeah they may get away but they said in the Dallas schools that that helps their educational process there well i think it does it it takes their minds off of of trying to compete Highland Park's thinking about going that route uh-huh so it and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do yeah i i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional but yeah i agree with you on  okay talk about uh what kind of restaurants we we like to go to and what uh makes us go back and i'll start talking about it so usually i just kind of like uh places that are family style kind of things because it's a a casual atmosphere and you usually get good portions of food and stuff and and uh but we were in California recently and i went we went to a couple of very uh i guess expensive extravagant restaurants because it was kind of the thing to do and we just wanted to see what it was like and we got to get some real good food more exotic and uh we thought that the service was very good and uh that kind of makes me want to go to those places again even though it is expensive you know like maybe once a year or once every six months go to it or something like that um-hum but how about you yeah i i enjoy going out but my husband goes out for dinner a lot with his company you know with his work uh-huh so it's something that i end up kind of experimenting with with my girlfriends or maybe taking my girls out when he's gone and uh-huh and so we end up usually finding something that's uh quick service and uh that's hopefully economical and uh certainly tastes good i hate to uh pay any kind of an amount and then have the food be real mediocre uh-huh um as far as to really go out for an evening though i do like to have a place that's not real real formal but kind of on a formal side just because usually their atmosphere is more on a quiet atmosphere and it's real relaxing and then uh the quality of food is usually kind of is affected by how the mood is set so uh-huh um i guess my favorite kind of foods foods would be uh the ones that well i don't know favorite is just going out for a good good hearty steak but yeah i i i find it amazing around here we don't have too many good steak houses it doesn't seem and i i find that amazing being in Texas i'm from another state originally and um-hum i always thought Texas was supposed to be such a good meat state um-hum and it seems to be a tough thing to do is to find a place that cooks up a real good juicy steak so um-hum you know what we have around here too is uh a place where you uh you pick your own meat and you cook it yourself oh really yeah and they they have everything else cooked you know but baked potatoes and all that but you you pick your meat and you know whether it's marinated or or just regular uh-huh and uh then they have a big grill and you grill it yourself you know and then have all the stuff to put on it you know like if you want to huh i don't know butter on it or whatever or garlic and stuff like that huh you can you can do it that's kind of interesting it was really good yeah it's kind of an interesting approach yeah we we thought that was that wasn't too bad but most of the time you know i was really surprised like i say going at these so fancier restaurants and and i thought i really liked the food you know it uh it was different because you know you see all these things like you see all these chef's chef's shows and stuff like that uh-huh and uh and you know i always watched and thought well i wonder if that's any good you know it looks kind of small but actually it wasn't bad at all yeah yeah you know when they have like seafood dishes uh but it's just kind of kind of sparse with different things put in it that that really uh that really taste pretty good you didn't you wouldn't think it goes together you know um-hum but uh but mostly around here now we just kind of just do family family type of things you know yeah because it's uh it's easier to go with two kids two young kids now yeah that's what we have too yeah and yeah you do have to kind of decide well are we there to get a good meal and and just yeah be comfortable as a family or are we looking to spend a lot of time and a lot of money which doesn't work with kids right right yeah that's true so what would make you go back to a good restaurant well i think uh some of the things that i liked were uh uh well i would see the food and whether or not it tastes good uh the service if they're you know courteous or if they just kind of are hasty you know if they just get your order and go and you never see them again or they coming talk you know talk with you a little bit or something um-hum uh-huh and do you find that when you have children that it's it really makes uh you can really tell the difference between a good and a mediocre restaurant by the way they treat you with kids yes i have we have we have noticed that yeah yes so uh you know if they more you you can tell when they're oriented towards kids now if they bring something for them to play with or to write with something you know yeah to occupy them you can really tell yeah the other thing i've liked too is uh now this isn't you don't have this at at family restaurants but uh is some type of a like a a pianist or something um-hum that will play some music while your eating and stuff and that was that that was kind of neat oh yeah yeah we have a restaurant over here called Gershwin's that has a piano player always during your mealtime and it uh-huh it just makes for a real classy feel and uh it kind of carries over the conversations next to you so you're not concentrating what someone else is saying next to you but i mean but you know at the next table but yeah just within your own little group so it makes for a nice nice place to go there was two places that we went to one in San Francisco and one in uh in Monterey California oh yeah and uh the one in San Francisco is the top of one of the downtown big skyscraper buildings and it was really neat because you could had a great view you know of San Francisco and everything uh-huh yeah and uh and that's another thing that would bring me back to a restaurant is the view and the one in in Monterey was really nice because it was overlooking the water too so that was that was a couple things that we liked yeah but well sounds good okay you have anything else to say no i think we covered everything okay well thanks a lot well thank you for being home okay bye-bye okay bye-bye  okay well having uh personally uh helped uh two children attend or or to select colleges one of them not very successfully i'm not sure if i'm any authority on this topic at all well which colleges did they go to well a daughter uh went to the University of Virginia that was a good selection she that's a beautiful school beautiful school yeah really is and she was she was very very happy there and very and very successful in what she picked to do so uh she's just graduated from there so that was a good selection uh our son has this kind of you know he's well he started out going Stephen F Austin and that turned turned into you know flunking out because of of of uh too many parties going on then he stayed out of school for a while then he went to Richland for a couple of years and then he went to to DePaul in Chicago which would have been great but uh it was so expensive so now he's now he's back well i guess the question then becomes how did you all make the selection or did you just let them do them by themselves well in in that case with him uh he kind of made the selections by himself and i think that we should have given him more direction and he was our first you know so we we didn't have quite the insight that uh that we would have had if he'd been our second like we did with Karen so uh but i i think you know i just in terms of of what happened i think that first of all i'd i would know the reputation of the school and uh for more than just academics but you know if it's a party school or not although i think every school is a party school to some degree personally well that's true of course uh you know for me my son he's only six and but i had the experience with my sister going to school and she was i treated my sister almost like my daughter because she was nine ten years younger than i was and it's right uh-huh right and she ended up going to the University of Oklahoma uh-huh i can say that because it was a big well known school it had a well known education and it was a wonderful education but yet it was a small school yeah right whereas i went to the University of Texas which was you know a million people go there yeah yeah i think that for me it's going to be one of those things yes i want to make sure it has a good education but i also want to keep it small enough that you can enjoy it because Texas to me was almost too big yeah i've heard that from people who have gone to Texas yeah i went to uh Iowa State which is also a big eight school like Oklahoma it's way too big yes yes i'm i'm quite aware yeah and uh when i was there it was maybe eleven or twelve thousand people which was just a great size i thought it's it's Texas only had fifty five thousand when i was there oh gosh that's just awful and for me i had to admit the one thing that i lacked was the uh interaction between uh students i knew everybody within my dorm but that was it uh-huh yeah because the school was just too big and whereas my sister when i went to visit her she knew everybody on the whole durn campus yeah yes that that's true it makes a lot of difference and uh so uh course now we're we're already telling our son you know Texas uh Oklahoma's good and Arkansas is good now of course Texas is good only because you know uh-huh you went to school there yeah right uh-huh i went because i went there of course but uh we're going my parents let me choose on my own and i want to pretty much allow him to choose on his own but i kind of keep an ear open as to what he's doing uh-huh sure oh yeah yeah well our daughter chose uh Virginia because she didn't want to go to school in Texas i mean she just sort of didn't want to go to school here well i was when i was in Louisiana in Shreveport i would go to any school except LSU i did not want to school in the in the same state uh-huh yeah same deal yeah and uh in fact she was accepted at two schools in Texas uh Rice and Trinity but she decided she wanted to go out of state and uh Virginia was uh you know in the east it wasn't a you know it wasn't an Ivy League school but it was well it's quite a bit further and it was uh of the state schools that she could have gone to it was one of the cheapest yet one of the best too you know with the academics and the tradition and everything that is there uh she made a really good selection we thought and so uh she pretty much made that herself herself but she did have some others in the wings you know there's another school that she she would have have gone to if she hadn't been accepted there so uh i don't know i think it really depends a lot on the child because our daughter is was just a lot more levelheaded about her process the process luckily i still have twelve more years to worry about it yeah so uh but you know i guess you have to really look at your finances and uh Texas has such a bargain in education i mean right now they do now if the uh legislature has their way they're going to raise the tuition in in double yeah i know i know and see back when i went to school there when i first entered the school it cost me two hundred dollars as an out as an out of state student uh that's something uh but then i was there for about two and a half years they then switched it to forty dollars per semester hour so almost overnight i went from two hundred dollars to eight hundred dollars oh wow my gosh and i have to admit uh that was a shocker i wasn't i wasn't quite ready for that one no i'll bet not it took me only about twelve years after i graduated to finish paying off the bill but that's yeah yeah yeah i know how that is but at least i was one of the good guys i did pay my bill off in full yes i did yeah you did pay yours good yeah my husband went to school on loans too and and we he was able you know we paid his off after we were married but uh well i'm at the university of Texas at Dallas and as a graduate student and uh you know i have to say that uh it's a real bargain i mean for as far as i'm concerned it's been a real bargain of course you know living at home makes a lot of difference if i had to to pay room and board somewhere that would make a lot of difference uh in yeah well what about the University of Virginia how much did it end end up costing uh i think uh on a yearly basis i'm trying to think i would just make it a rough figure of about uh with with the travel expenses and so on although she didn't come home that much uh actually i would say between twelve and thirteen thousand a year that's a long way uh that's not too bad it's not when you look at the you know the school and the fact that she was now did she get to did she get to live in the dorm on that very front row you know that goes up by the rotunda uh no on the lawn no no that's that's an honor that's bestowed on very few and she didn't get to do that although she knew people who did live there but yeah that's that would have been neat when we went to visit it we didn't know what it was and my little kid he was opening every one of the mailboxes looking inside to see what he could find well you know the graduation takes place right there on the lawn on on that in that big fat grassy area and uh yeah they had four thousand graduates this spring and boy that was quite an event i'll tell you yeah we went on the Blue Ridge Parkway last year and we went to visit th at was the very last thing we saw was at the tail end of the Parkway we had we had a blast oh yeah yeah that's a great place to visit that really is yeah it is it i can see why you want to go there that's yeah well they're just so it's just steeped in tradition and and the uh you know they're they still talk about Mister Jefferson the you know i mean the founder of the school of course was Mister Jefferson Thomas Jefferson and they and and a lot of uh-huh and of course you'v e got to go to say hello to Monticello yeah yeah right uh-huh and and a lot of the of his traditions i mean for instance they don't call the students freshmen sophomore junior senior they call them first year second year third year and fourth year because Mister Jefferson felt that one's education never ended and to you put those four designations of freshmen sophomore and so on on the person's education limited them and he felt that you could go on to school forever you should just have the number of years that you were there attached to your name if you want to do identify someone so huh i had to be very careful about talking about seniors or fourth year students you got to get the terminology right well i tell you what i've enjoyed talking i'm going to go ahead and hang up on this end because it's just about time for supper so yes all righty yes it certainly is i got to go make it here actually it it was a fun conversation i enjoyed it well i i this is my last one you're number ten of ten that i can i congratulations well congratulations  okay do you want to start okay um i haven't i don't know that much about the possible what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury but um i think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide um-hum i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide although it's difficult because they all have to be new unanimous now that do you do you agree that they should all be unanimous or even even in uh like they said you know lesser you know trials you know lesser convictions do you think that they should be all unanimous still i don't i don't know i don't know if i feel i don't feel real strongly about that if the um the thing is though i i didn't think that even if it was a lower conviction i didn't think that you could um i didn't think that you really had to have a a jury um-hum unless i guess if you request one you can but i think yeah making it unanimous sometimes might um let the only thing it might let more people get off i don't think it would convict any more people uh-huh and we have so many people already you know the jails are already overloaded well the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous i mean if one is determined that it's you know that he feels that he's you know going against the other eleven they all stay until everyone agrees so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting you know just gives in yeah well if it's no but they they what if they never agree doesn't it just um do they have to go back and do a whole new trial or and they have to stay in until they all agree yeah i don't know i'm not sure if they go i mean to twelve new people agree or what they do exactly but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either you know either he or she can either go free or to jail either one yeah yeah and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe that's a little stringent um-hum especially because there's twelve the thing about it is i think jury selection too a lot of times um the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury and they can sway them that way too that's just that's just it i don't understand you're supposed to you know go in if you have you know like if you've never heard of the people before or anything but i don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total totally impartial to it i know i don't think well i guess you really can't but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either um-hum so um but then again you know they the one of the questions they asked is should it just be decided by a judge and that's kind of tricky too because a lot of positions the judges are in they they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too um-hum yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over i know you know so it it's i i i think i think in in the end the judge has the presiding you know um vote i think he can be you know i i don't know if it's the way it is in real life but i've seen it on TV where the juries go one way and the judge totally totally finds it obnoxious and he completely you know goes the other way now i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what yeah i think in some cases they are but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's you know so that's another thing where they have the power but um-hum yeah maybe juries could be less than twelve people or would that be more fair or less fair maybe there should be more than twelve people i don't oh oh my God if there were more than twelve can you imagine how long they'd be sitting i know i know i don't know i i think it's just i don't i mean i think it's as fair as it can possibly get but i just think it's really hard you know i mean some cases go on for years you know that's true and i've never been on jury duty but they have to keep going and going and going um-hum and lose their not lose their jobs but not go to work yeah i i don't know how it could be more fair course i don't know maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on on trial before it could be really i've never seen one in real life either so i don't have you know i don't know that much about it but i think it seems that we have a a pretty fair system compared to other countries i don't know how we could make it more fair i really don't um-hum the unanimous vote is questionable though and and how how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed too um-hum yeah because uh i don't know if you should have really really have a jury for small a small infraction um-hum but i'm not sure who gets them i don't know anything i know i don't know that much about it either i just i don't know i i guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail you know how they can make it more fair for them or not but then again maybe they should be there so that is fair right i don't i i don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way no whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty uh unique i think when they started it um-hum yeah so how long do we need to talk do you know oh i think we can hang up anytime okay um in um what do i do now do you know anything or just wait for someone else no i don't know what else to say so okay okay well it was nice talking with you it was nice talking to you too bye thanks bye-bye  okay okay well did you go to college yes i did and where did you go i went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia uh-huh um it was Sweeper College it was about seven hundred and fifty students i had gone to a small school growing up uh and a lot of my friends went to univerty University of Michigan but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when i graduated and um were looking for a southern school and um-hum um also U of M seemed overwhelming in size and um what about you well i went to the University of Minnesota oh so you're from the Midwest too i am uh-huh where do you live now um i live in Texas now where are you well i'm in Texas i'm in Austin oh um my brother's in Austin um he lives Lakeway he um had moved uh we're in Plano uh-huh i'm familiar with Plano i visited once or twice and oh Austin is so pretty i really like it oh i love it i love it i really do and your daughter is going to be a sophomore that's correct i have two daughters but my oldest will be will be a sophomore is um because you live in Austin is she thinking about the University of Texas she has her heart set on U T and um you know having gone to the University of Minnesota i know what a big university is like and um one thing that i did this summer which i thought might benefit both my daughters is my youngest daughter got involved in band and Baylor has a band camp oh so she went for a week and it was overnight and they lived in the dorms and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's you know like on a college a smaller college campus and um my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school so um i i i still think the exposure was good yes the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought well you know what were your selection criteria did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford or you know there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision um yeah those um and those were several uh that we did consider um my parents uh um certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south and because i had been in a small school they suggested that i probably i when i say small my graduating class had eighteen in it oh wow and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of one-on-one oh definitely um or small group situations and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology and i also wanted to spend um-hum one year studying in Europe um i had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year oh how exciting i and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing and i ended up majoring in French one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department they also had a strong language department and i'd always loved working with children um and i found that i couldn't fit everything in but because i had had a fair amount of French going in i was able um-hum to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me um oh that was a that worked out very well for you and so that was some of but several of the things you mentioned were the things that um our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M he's but he thinks he wants to be a writer and i don't think that well then he should come to U T yes um and really his his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand um-hum um and so he's used to a bigger size and because my brother is there large classes uh he would have family close by so there there are advantages um but i also because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan which was so large and they really felt um like they were numbers oh i went from a large high school to a university large university and i definitely felt like i was a number um i mean you still yeah it is a different feeling but that was that was my only option i i mean i just really couldn't look at anything else that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than a junior you know a junior college which i didn't want to do so that's how you know my decision was made but um well that's that's certainly um especially today with the cost of college i mean that is a a major um consideration and i do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools and even though Baylor um yes and when you mentioned that we we have friends who have children there who just love it and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are and it is a smaller size and um i do feel like there are a lot of options it's it's but i had been hoping some schools i know give um oh even this year Jay had an aptitude test um what what does he hopes to be a writer yes he thinks that's what he'd like to do but he's really strong in math and science too and huh we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind does your daughter know what she'd like to do oh she she has uh you know interests that are just you know going in all directions um yeah what she talks about a lot is theater which i think is okay Bethany let's be real um she really is is pretty unfocused at this point and i don't know she's taken a lot of French and she may end up doing something with that and i am a single mom so i've been and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake and i'm you know showing them if you're strong in math and science kiddos this is one area where women can make some decent money yes you know i mean i'm kind of really putting the practical application you know and and saying yet d o something that you enjoy um-hum by all means go get that piece of paper you know do you just have one son yes i see well it sounds like he's got some really you know good strong ideas of what he wants to do well he but he has even now that he's in high school um and of course there's there is still time but he's beginning to feel that as much as he enjoys writing he wonders if he can make a living at it you know it's the it's  uh do you want to give a start on it well i think for me i i'm from Alabama south Alabama and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement uh-huh uh-huh uh in a pretty liberal family for for that area at the time uh-huh and so i was very much a part of all the uh you know what was going on there uh uh-hum my parents are pretty active and uh it was very scary and but now we've seen you know uh black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and i guess all over than they did you know twenty years ago oh definitely there's still a lot to be you know to be accomplished but uh-huh for me when i think about social change that's what i first think of because i can remember you know separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and sitting in the back of the bus and everything uh-huh uh-huh you can relate to that now see we didn't we don't have any of that because well like we live in the country uh-huh in Clarion County and uh we really didn't have things like that going on that we you know uh ran into uh-huh so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh uh visiting habits of families and such uh uh yeah well that's true that's a good one right there yeah that there's less visiting done i think on a whole than there used to be used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not you went visiting and uh today you know people they do visit but it's not quite the same as uh what it was say twenty years ago thirty years ago right and i grew up in out in the country too basically in a rural area and with lots of family uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and so we were always at family in different people family members' homes but even now you know they don't even do that right uh-huh uh-huh well they're so spread out i think has a lot to do with it well and they're so busy people people's personal schedules are so busy uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh mainly because i a lot of it has to do i think with more women working in our family you know twenty years ago not that many of the women worked and now uh almost all the women work right right that's right yeah the majority yeah uh-huh and so that means you know a lot of a lot of the social visiting and all was i think probably instigated by women at that time right and now probably because when you work you don't really care to go out and visit as much that's right and now uh i mean my mother does not work and and she you know she's finds finds herself pretty alone a lot because most of her friends are working women and uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but even just social visits people don't do that anymore you're right and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people anymore no huh-uh they don't do as much uh-huh there's a real you have to make arrangements or have an invitation or right you know you don't want to you want to make sure it's okay or i guess we don't not to make invade people's privacy or whatever yeah yeah well that could be part of it i don't know for sure what it is i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance so we really don't have that even we don't yeah well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles oh really and that and most live within ten or or twenty so but that's you know that is rural it's a rural family and oh that's pretty good yeah uh-huh uh-huh most people didn't go away i'm just one of the two out of fifteen that don't live in the you know even in the same state uh-huh uh-huh well apparently there must be work available yeah there is in that area for those that are uh-huh because around here there's really nothing for the young people no good i mean there's jobs there's minimum wage jobs but uh to make a good living there really around here there just isn't too much um-hum and i guess you know that would greatly affect social change i use social change probably the job market has always and the the economy has always affected uh social change uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh probably so well there's the main things i can think of i really tried to think of some other things and i couldn't really well i think just also you know that the women's movement too has affected a lot of social change uh people marry yeah definitely some good and some bad yeah people marry later uh-huh i mean basically i think now again where i'm from in in Alabama that's not necessarily true because people do still get married right out of high school uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but now out here in Texas where i am now that's very unusual they'd rather get their life started first before uh-huh most people get married i mean get go to college or at least get a job and even you know people are seem to a lot of people seem to uh-huh be engaged for a long time before they get married because they do want to be financially set up uh-huh uh-huh yeah well even to get school finished i think a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration and if you're busy with school it's i think it's really difficult for a family right but probably uh you know more women being in in the work force also greatly greatly affects social change because it affects child care and uh uh-huh uh-huh right right yeah i know my my daughter that lives in Pittsburgh she has two little boys and they they've been in day care since you know one's four and one's one but right and they've done well now i wouldn't want to do it that way but uh she's quite happy and the children seem quite adjusted and uh well and they're you know they're they're saying right now we don't know what we just now are seeing the effects of day care on the generation that's just now coming into the work force and in their twenties uh-huh that's right yeah uh-huh yes uh-huh they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care and so you know it remained to be seen exactly what that what that does that's right yeah uh-huh now i'm going to babysit my granddaughter she's just eight weeks old so this will be new for me uh-huh so uh but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all where do they live uh well i have a son and daughter that live in Pittsburgh one in Maryland and one in Connecticut a son in Connecticut well they're not too far though no but like Connecticut takes eight hours to drive home and uh it's too far to you know really go too often uh-huh Pittsburgh's not quite so bad it's just a couple hours Maryland maybe five hour drive well i live like fourteen hours from home in fact i'm that's uh-huh that's worse yet i'm driving tomorrow i'm i'm driving home tomorrow so to go be there for the Fourth of July oh are you really do you uh stay overnight on the way or you no i can drive it all it's just me so i can make it i'm thirty five you're young how old are you okay well you're young enough yet to although it's it's it is pretty i don't know i don't enjoy it that much it's pretty much like get there and uh-huh it's work to get there yeah yeah huh it's just not that pleasant even with other people i basically just don't like to drive that far uh-huh now my son they they flew he rebuilt a Aranca Chief airplane and they flew down last weekend they came down in it and it still took a long time because it's not a fast it's not a high-speed airplane uh-huh but they enjoyed in thoroughly so when you say you're in the second phase of this project what is the second phase of it i'm not sure but you have to change phones you have to call from another a different oh  and hello there so i guess the question is do you have any pets what do you have hi yes we well we have a cat yes named Bounce actually it's Bounce the uh about third a cat named Bounce Bounce the third okay yeah uh that's because when i was little i had a storybook about a cat named Bounce and and the name stuck with you and the cat was um gray and white in particular had to be gray and white so all the Bounces have been gray and white we also have a rabbit okay very good a rabbit named Coco Bunny and i assume that now the rabbit doesn't get out right the rabbit's in in the cage okay right the rabbit is in a cage outdoors only year round and this rabbit has been with us for um oh six seven eight eight years one now do you just have one rabbit in other words it never multiplies okay one rabbit No that's for sure and uh that's actually all the pets we have at this time well i've i've had uh i had three Cocker Spaniels uh up until about how about you um four or five i guess about four years ago and they they were all very old twelve thirteen and fourteen fifteen and they died and but i believe the a child must have a um hum um-hum yeah pet to grow up with so on my uh kid's fourth birthday his birthday present was a Basset Hound right oh which as he calls it a basket hound but that's okay yes but uh anyway so yes we have the Basset Hound who is now two years old and in fact it just had the lovely uh oh yeah cute uh-huh yesterday i got to take the dog to the veterinarian for his shots oh boy that's one of the uh to me one of the things i don't care about having a pet about did right yeah does he live indoors or outdoors outdoor yeah that's kind of no he's an outdoor dog uh he's a very low maintenance dog uh we actually have a uh an automatic feeder and we have an automatic waterer so he always has plenty of water um-hum um um-hum so i don't have to worry about going out there and like for example i'm going on this two week vacation he'll be fine yeah ooh how nice no one even has to look after him although we have a neighbor who's going to come over you know say hello just to keep him happy but uh um-hum he's just in the fenced backyard and he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that yeah well how nice yeah that sounds like a good situation that's about how i would like to have a dog if i had a dog see our cat is also um well outdoors and in the garage at one time she was an indoor cat and then she started to do things in the house that i didn't appreciate claw now has it been declawed no no no no well it has not oh you should have you ever thought of having it well no because she's outdoors okay okay so if she's outdoors i don't want her declawed true true true um but she um she was kind of a feisty feisty feisty little character when she was little and as she has gotten older because she's about seven years old now my wife would very much like to have a cat because she she grew up with a cat then uh the cat lived indoors and the whole bit i just don't care for cats i don't know what it is about it but she i guess because would she yeah yeah well they're so independent a lot of people don't i yes they are you can't say come here i mean it just doesn't you know that's true it could just stand there and stare at you in a strange way in fact my cat right now is just rubbing up against the the wood on the door here staring with a look of don't you want to feed me or to pick me up and love me yes you sweet thing hum well we have a humongous uh our back what do you call it the uh living room has nothing but one big window after another so it's all windows and we can look out in the backyard and we're always seeing the dog and the dog you know he's um-hum um-hum he he knows when we're in the room because when we're in the room and just come walking down the hall whatnot he'll come and and look at us you know we'll wave at him he'll come back to you you know yeah um-hum so he is sociable even though he even though he's outdoors yeah yes he is he's very most loving dog you've ever had i can't i can't really i cannot imagine not having a dog yeah my boys and um my husband have been talking recently about having a dog but we don't have a a fenced in backyard and we don't want a fenced in backyard we're on a corner and we look out at a creek and a park and we just you know one reason we well what you have to do is have an indoor dog yeah i guess it would have to be and we and they can be very nice too after after they've been trained yeah that's true yeah well that's right and they do require a lot of training yeah yeah that's for sure now my dog he you know we've got him trained that we could bring him inside but once we bought the new house my wife said uh-huh no no he's not coming inside this house so uh-hum um well pets pets really are hard on houses i mean there's just no doubt about that we've my husband was in really estate for a while and you know he had more problems over pets um in both rental houses and houses that people owned and other people looked at it and didn't like the way it smelled and so so that's my main um-hum and they do get the carpet uh soiled sometimes objection yeah i mean even even the best trained one you know is going to have problems from time to time and you just can't really get that that smell out and yes well i tell you what i've got some uh carpet uh cleaner that uh you know it's some type of dog smell smell away it works wonderful it really really does um-hum well that's good when we moved into this house both dogs and cats had been in it and um we did not realize that there was a problem and after we moved in it was so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house oh and uh when they pulled the carpeting up it was so bad on the back there were so many spots you just wouldn't believe and um they they we had to have a exterminating company come in and they had to treat the concrete slab oh come on and they had to wear you know gas masks and stuff so we moved everything from one half of the house to the other half and you know then got took took that well actually both now this is from a cat or a dog okay that um took that part of the carpeting up and then treated that and we had to stay out of the ho use for you know ten hours or something and then we came back and then they put the new carpet down there moved the furniture back to that half of the house and had had to do it again because yes dogs need training but cats usually don't even need any training seem like they automatically go to their little litter box they think yeah yeah no they usually don't yeah yeah so anyway we've had that that was a very bad experience well i don't really think we're going to have any more indoor pets well in fact if we're getting ready to go on our vacation my little six year old now he's saying we need to buy a mother dog to take care of uh Copper while we're gone i said you don't buy mother dogs you buy little puppies so they'd have company right well it really is fun to have two pets together um-hum yeah and and and my wife's saying uh-huh no well we had three at one time we had three in the backyard all at one time and they played and they also humped on each other all the time but you know they yeah yeah but they must really have fun together it it's cute to see several several at a time like that oh they did although i'll tell you what it really would scare me like now in the summer when this hot uh when they're playing that hard i you know it's i'm not sure if that was that good for them or not oh yeah um-hum but our dog does have plenty of company let me because of the uh we have a just the kids the fence that we have has slats in it so he can see outside and he is constantly chasing the kids and people walk in our neighborhood he's always and we're on the corner too so you know he has a lot of traffic going by and he um-hum um-hum  okay what do you think about the school systems uh well where i live in Plano one of their big things that they hype it within the community is their school system uh-huh right and uh in fact i think that there's some areas of of Dallas and Richardson that are in the those city town city limits but they uh all of the the housing developments adjoining Plano are in the Plano school district and they use that as one of the things that they uh you know that they try to market when they sell homes in that area the fact that it is in Plano schools uh i do have children in that school system uh and have been personally pleased with that uh i'm not sure that it's that that there's that much glory in the Plano schools versus say Richardson and some of the other areas okay uh what do you see as being a problem with the school system uh probably the biggest controversy within our school system is the use of the open classroom concept uh where uh all uh all the students at a given grade level are in one large area for much of the day uh segregated you know by teacher but not necessarily having walls between the classrooms uh-huh uh i've now had two children that are have been in the system in the system uh one who seemed to do just fine in that tap type of atmosphere the other i'm not so sure about because of uh his attention span i think he's a little bit more easily distracted than was she oh and that seems to be the primary complaint uh i think my biggest complaint problem with the Plano schools right now is that many of the schools do not have cafeterias and kids have to take their lunch back to their classroom to eat uh rather than giving them a a break from that area during the day uh-huh uh and uh that's i guess i'm a fairly satisfied uh parent as far as the school system goes myself uh that that it really boils down to the quality of the teachers uh-huh uh and their interest uh in the students individually is going to make the difference versus you know physical things such as the open classroom versus a more closed classroom uh what do you see as problems yeah well i don't have children in school and it's been so long since i was in school myself i'm not really sure how to answer that yeah when uh i don't know it seems that they're you know that that the difference is between each school i think if it was if it could possibly be standardized a little bit that it would be much easier to to gauge you know how uh a particular group of students was doing right uh the curriculums differ so much and i'm not saying that that's bad necessarily but i think it makes very hard to tell where an actual problem is uh-huh you know you can't really tell from a group of students if it's a if if it's the the teacher that's got the problem or if it's the book that's got the problem you know what the materials that they're using and everything right that could be causing a problem now in in Dallas i know at least at some of the later grade levels they have these magnet schools that i think were initially set up to address the segregation issues uh-huh uh and i wondered uh what the real overall effect on education is of those uh i know i have a niece in the Dallas system that is a uh was just elected to go or selected whatever i i think you have to apply and be accepted to these magnet schools but she's interested in the arts and in in particular in dance what kind of school is that uh they call it a magnet school where it attracts kids of certain interest oh okay and uh she will be attending i think Skyline Arts Magnet uh or arts and something magnet school uh next year when she enters high school yeah i think that's kind of a good idea because you know it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't divide people by by anything besides what they're interests are yeah and it's a much higher it's a learning environment if you're group if you're interested in sciences and you're grouped with other people that are interested in sciences uh-huh it seems like it would it would uh it would help now i would think that would would be a good point as well yeah they they don't have that type of thing in Plano they just have these two gargantuan high schools uh-huh uh but i do think they do provide some type of special interest focus i think the later years uh for for students okay what do you think about about sports in high school and about uh the competitiveness i've i've know i've seen in Plano that there's a lot of really vicious competitiveness between the children at the different high schools well and do you think that's healthy oh not really uh i've not been that aware of it uh-huh uh i live on it is somewhat divided by east and west Plano with Central Expressway down the middle yeah uh-huh uh and i am on the west side but just barely on the west side i guess my kids are younger than that and in they're in the non competitive uh just athletics uh organizations you know your typical soccer and baseball and all that sort of stuff oh yeah uh-huh and because of where we live uh the teams that my son has been on has have been from both sides of the fence if you will oh okay they've drawn from both sides and i really haven't sensed any of that yet i it may become more obvious to me in later on uh-huh i think the one of the more interesting things in Plano is that they have high schools and senior high schools which a lot of people don't realize that that ninth and tenth grade go to high schools of which there there are quite a few in Plano and the senior high schools are only the eleventh and twelfth grade uh-huh now i didn't even realize that at all yeah that's was very different uh they have middle school sixth seventh and eighth um right and then they'll have uh fact they have a couple of huge schools that are actually almost all middle school and elementary school all of those grades in one building huh but uh well i know they've got a lot of elementary schools for the most part yeah bunch of elementary and they typically feed certain middle schools for sixth seventh and eighth and then there a number at least i could probably think of six high schools well now what is Shepton going to be Shepton is a high school okay ninth and tenth okay and uh there's Shepton and Vines and Wilson or Williams and there's Clark and i don't know whether there's more than four i want to say that there are more than just four but uh it's just ninth and tenth grade and then the the two senior high schools are just eleventh and twelfth graders um which is a sort of a different concept yeah that does seem kind of different and they're they're just so big i'm a little bothered by that uh just the sheer  well the weather has been certainly has been hot and it's been humid i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high for uh this late into uh well it's not really late into the summer but the the humidity has hung around all of June yeah are you native to this area no i grew up in Michigan so uh but i've been i've been in Texas for fifteen years oh okay uh-huh so uh but you know i know the summers get hot but it certainly uh this humidity has just really hung on there uh-huh yeah yeah it seemed like well you know last year was so strange having all those heavy heavy rains in April and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until May kind of like pushed the season back a little farther and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity and it just tried to rain i mean i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago and it was trying to rain which yes seems strange to have it raining in July normally we don't have too much uh humidity or or uh rainy time when it's past June oh that's right that's right i can remember it not it's really August that it happens you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry and it just gets so dry and the earth opens up right i can remember the first year i moved here and it didn't rain i moved here like in late August and it didn't rain from August until December and uh-huh from August until December and i went home and told it just doesn't rain in Texas i mean it was great after growing up in Michigan and not and all you know every day was cloudy almost every day was cloudy and i you you sort of forget how much it did rain and coming here and then it didn't rain it was just wonderful well yeah see i i lived in uh Ohio mainly i lived in uh Pontiac just a little while before i came down here and oh yeah you know so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather it might rain on your little parade that's right that's right you know and here it was like pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out yeah uh you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do that's right oh what part of Michigan were you living in oh i grew up in Dearborn okay yeah yeah which is a suburb of of Detroit you probably know where that is because i know where Pontiac is so uh anyway yeah anyway yeah oh a teaching job what brought you down here so you teach in Plano schools yeah i did i did for a while uh-huh so i'm home with home with two children so uh so new career oh okay okay new career but uh anyway so that kind of uh well i had been down here to visit so i finished school and said hey let's you know find a place that has a nice job and uh that's how it worked out well yeah i think a lot of people were uh leaving Michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus you know the the little joke about will the last person leaving Michigan just turn out the light oh yeah oh well it's a nice place you know i mean it's it's a nice that's a nice place though well you know i i said i lived in uh the Pontiac i didn't live in the city of Pontiac i lived to the west of it uh i forget the the county but you know where all the lakes are around there okay sort of i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes it was real close to where i worked it was only like four miles to work and it was wonderful being on the lake like that you know in the summer you feel like you're you know on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake and everybody's you know out enjoying the water and such and uh in the winter time the lakes froze over you could still kind of go sledding and such out there but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes there's lots of really small ones out there yeah you know like maybe a mile two long that's enough to uh do some boating and it was lots of fun yeah that's right that's right Lake i think Lake Whitmore is the only one i have real memories of um which is well i think it's i think it's toward Ann Arbor so it's probably out in that direction but that's the only one i probably could name after all these years so uh-huh yeah yeah but uh but it was yeah just lots of little lakes and of course it was you know a little more expensive to live on the lake but i just thought that was grand and i think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them but there was quite a few lakes all around there it seemed like it was almost like you were living on an island there was so much water around where i was i said i wasn't close to downtown Pontiac i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from from the city limits and it was really nice out there yeah we had uh Pine Knob you know to go skiing and stuff so there were things around there really was pretty nice oh right right sure sure and don't isn't that where they have a summer music festival there too right right in the summertime they have musicals there and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope uh that's right that's right i know we used to we we didn't do a lot of it but we did yeah yeah we did so those are always fun and Alpine was it Alpine was another ski slope that we went to so uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it was nice i always tell people that in the winter we use we used to uh my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on you know make a pond in the backyard for us oh yeah yeah so but uh you know we probably did some ice skating on it but then it chipped chipped and you know it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven so yeah yeah we used to have a Christmas time uh some of our relatives would come up from Alabama and i think most times we would have snow around Christmas and the kids when they were young would just go nuts yeah you know because they were from Alabama where it never snowed and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it you know eternally oh oh oh right right if only it would make nice snow here in Texas we'd be okay at Christmas time my first winter here i i came down in uh early eighty two and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in December before couple days before Christmas it lasted only a few hours like by noon it was gone yeah yeah and i remember getting up and somebody telling me hey better wait to go to work because the roads are all you know snow and i was laughing going yeah right that's a good practical joke ha ha they said no really there's snow and there was but a very short time and the weather got warm so quick it just melted it all away yeah yeah yeah i kno w course when we get an ice storm that's not too much fun no that's not fun either so uh i i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets so but uh well we have our house is kind of on a little hill so uh we get the sled out and uh the kids go down the hill the hill on the sleds when it's icy i mean they just go down the ice and if it's cold we say okay out you go i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there yeah oh yeah i think it's fun even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit i mean sometimes the ice is pretty bad but if you get on the the uh grassy kind of part you get a little bit of traction you know not slip and fall i mean first  well Vic you said your professional your favorite professional football team was the was the Cowboys that's right well you know i i could uh pick the uh Chicago team oh you could yeah i got a lot of northern neighbors here okay and uh they really uh pull for the Chicago what are the what are the Chicago team called the Bears yeah right the Bears right i'm not sure how they'll do this year i don't know who they'll use as quarterback Chicago Chicago right i'm not sure they know who they'll use at quarterback yet right well there's a lot of good teams out there in the professional world and uh course we hope also that the Cowboys do good i know i do and it's your favorite team so why don't you tell me about them well what uh i get optimistic about is just uh the relative age of the team now with all the youth that they've added and sort of a change in the nature of the team to the to more of the uh the the pure athlete type at all the positions um i like them having added a wide receiver with a nice track background that can high jump real high uh-huh what's his name uh Alvin Harper i think out of Tennessee because he was a think he's about six foot three and apparently can catch anything that's anywhere near him and uh Harper um-hum um-hum i understand that in high school he high jumped seven feet i'll be darned when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now uh particularly probably down in the end zone where Troy can go back there and put one up in the sky and let him go up and get it well is he a fragile uh football player you know they had an end or a a wingback or something like that that would go down the field and and uh he did real good for the Cowboys and every time he turned around he was getting hurt getting hurt i don't think this one has any a record like that he seems to be more of a a a sturdy athlete i see i know they have lost a lot of their receivers to injuries in the last few years what's the coach's name Johnson yeah Jimmy Jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year well he did better last year than most people thought including including myself but uh yeah but what about his players uh and their reactions to him and his uh kind of unorthodox professional football type uh coaching well i guess you mean by that that he sort of brings a more of a college atmosphere to it than than certainly than his predecessor yeah right uh-huh i really don't know how they they really react to that It probably does him well right now with with like i said the youth he has on the team uh-huh um i think one thing he did this year that will probably pay some dividends is is changing the offensive coach that bring in a new uh offense and new offensive system that i think the so far the players are are uh responding responding well to and Jimmy's going to leave the offense to the offensive coach well that's the theory yeah uh-huh and what about the quarterback do you think he is uh going to stick in there and not wind up there with a concussion well i don't know whether anybody can for a whole year anymore yeah that's true but uh he is uh he's pretty sturdy but he's got to learn to get rid of it pretty quick uh-huh uh well is Cowboys your your favorite team as well or well really in reality uh they are my favorite team uh uh and have been you know back since the glory days or before the glory days they used to practice you know right over here uh on uh six thirty five and Coit right in that area right well over there at uh near Forrest i think and uh-huh yeah right uh-huh and uh it was a dingy little old field uh uh that uh you you would have thought maybe a a high school would have played on and it's all surrounded you know by apartments and businesses and everything i was shocked when i saw it that's the one that i think that was the place that had the looked like corrugated tin fence around it painted blue yeah and it had holes in it and it had big tire on it where the former coach you know uh stood up in there in there and right but i guess uh you know it doesn't take a lot of uh fancy things to make a good football team well i guess not but since they did uh they were America's team you know back then yeah during that time period they sure were and and i don't think they are now though looks like somebody else laid claim to that do you go to many of do you go to many of the games or have you before uh i've been to several games uh in my lifetime however i prefer to watch the uh watch the game uh via the TV tube well i guess i do too really yeah i i i find myself uh when i go to the football games of uh of uh missing a play by talking to somebody in the group or a stands a fan stands up or i'm looking at the cheerleaders or the clowns right and when something does happen i say what happened you know and then course uh you can see it on the on the playback out there uh but back there when i was going i don't think it was that good uh-huh or if they had it at all you know right that's right i think i went to more of their games when they were still operating out of uh the Cotton Bowl yeah uh-huh than i have since they moved to Texas Stadium uh-huh we we have a lake house see and we go out of town course oh that works out nicely and yeah we just go down there and uh watch the game i'm hoping that they'll be successful and they'll have a lot more sellouts and fewer blackouts this year yes absolutely and and uh if the team you know starts off good this year i think that uh they will be a a drawing card and perhaps they can uh return to their former glory days uh-huh you know i had people uh all over the world you know that i run into uh say you know they think of one thing the Dallas Cowboys and the movie Dallas that's right and so uh i think that uh they will come back and Johnson while he's unorthodox i think he is doing a good job and he's all uh he's all business yeah he is that and he got a lot he got he got rid of a lot of the cry babies uh the people that thought that had it they had it made because uh they were stars right and he cleaned that out real good and and i'm sure he lost some good ones that shouldn't have gone but in his type offense he was looking for youth and for uh uh uh to rebuild a new team and i think that was the reason why he cut all the players uh-huh and i think also that oil man that uh that uh owns that oilman and his partners that own the team uh is interested in making a dollar and and they've certainly gone to uh great lengths to you know to bring the team back into Texas for spring training right and and also to build up the team to try to satisfy the people and the various factions you know uh especially back in the beginning i think he's done a great job well that's n ice what's his name uh oh the uh Jones yeah Jones is his name Jones yeah and uh he's an oilman and he's got a little money behind him and uh and uh so you know the they've got the stadium out there it's a  well now i i have a question for you do you like uh fresh water fishing or salt water fishing okay i like well what i usually do is fresh water fishing i haven't been salt water fishing since i was about ten is that right yeah and i do everything up at Lake Texoma oh yeah i'm a striper fisherman oh you do okay oh where do you fish for striper there oh everywhere wherever those little suckers are but uh we camp at the lodge Texoma State Park okay over on the Oklahoma side and uh but usually when we go striper fishing when i go out for the big ones we travel down the you know where the channel is down the middle of the lake oh um-hum uh-huh pretty much we usually chase them down through there okay so you're out in a boat then oh yeah oh yeah do you ever go up there oh i've gone up there camping like at Eisenhower State Park and i've observed fishing but i've never actually fished there uh-huh oh it's good fishing up there yeah so you like to go for striper then yeah of course i won't you know i won't throw anything back well the time i went and watched i went over to the uh to the dam and it was right after one of the major major rains that we'd had uh in fact i think it had been over the spillway recently when we went it was back down but uh some of the roadblocks were still up or there was evidence of them oh yeah uh-huh and people were they really had the gates open oh my gosh that's supposed to be the greatest time to fish big time well i couldn't believe some of the striper that these people were pulling out and there were just people galore for that matter just just everywhere just huge fish yeah oh yeah oh yeah it's fun well my dad got me hooked on it so to speak and uh yeah oh God pun pun and uh we'd go out he liked to go out about five thirty and you know watch the sun come up every morning and uh boy we all right we knew a bunch of the striper guides and and so we'd follow them and he had a CB on the boat and all that kind of stuff and we'd just follow the channel and when it's you know middle July through late August when it's so hot they stay down real deep all the big ones do yeah follow that channel on up deep in the channel huh i'll be but uh so now my cousin will i make him get up early in the morning and take me out striper fishing and then we usually fish under the bridge at night with the kids and his wife and stuff like that because where we go a lot of times oh wow uh the waves are so big i don't want my kids out there because it's sort of dangerous but i love it i love it right well i used to fish go every summer to northern Canada oh really and so i i've been spoiled by that uh but i had a string of seven or eight years in a row oh of uh sort of a close knit group we would just hop in the car and drive straight through two thousand miles oh how much fun and uh we started out fishing out of a lodge and then we started uh either taking our own canoes or renting them when we got there and hitting a few of the oh my goodness you know smaller lakes along the river chain and uh catch Northern Pike and walleye primarily uh-huh oh my goodness and sometimes Lake Trout also oh how much fun so we'd always go the first week in June you know essentially as soon as school was out and everything is all over and done we'd uh we go uh uh-huh course one year i went two weeks too early with a friend that was he at this point he'd graduated from college and was in the Army and he had a two week period he he had to work with before he got shipped off to Germany oh my goodness and so i went with him in the middle of May and much to our surprise when we got there all the lakes were still frozen no yeah the first week we were there we just had to camp and oh you're kidding ooh not for me uh we could go on the streams they were open up you know the flowing where the water was flowing but the lakes themselves were still iced over for the whole yeah whole first week we were there uh-huh oh my gosh ooh but then the next week they were just just like day and night difference we had some rain and wind and it it cleared all the lakes off and uh you know the fishing was already really picking up but uh uh-huh those were my favorite fishing trips the most serious fishing i guess i've done yeah yeah when i take the kids out like i say we in fact Memorial Day weekend we went up to the lake and uh my cousins have a boat my boat is sitting in my driveway not running and uh so we go up there and we decided oh that we'd you know go out first we got everybody's tents up and camp made and all that and said come on let's go fishing we hauled in well we brought in thirty three fish and we had thrown a bunch of little ones back good grief yeah and uh so then we had a huge fish fry the next afternoon and we went back out fishing and we caught and brought in thirty three more and had thrown a bunch of the little ones back but we had more fun those kids wow they've got real fishing poles but they're the little short ones right and it was so funny because i mean they'd just be hanging over the side of the boat mom i think i got a fish i think i got a fish oh it was hysterical but that's incredible boy Jamie's getting to the age now that when i get up and go fishing early in the morning he wants to go too you know he doesn't want to get left behind anymore oh boy yeah so it's getting a little difficult to do that but we love it we just love it well i need to break my kids in they i have a son you know Wesley that enjoys it but he hasn't really caught enough fish to appreciate any fishing so i i'd like to break them in a little bit uh-huh uh-huh well i have to watch it because Ashley'll out fish her brother half the time and so you know that gets a little sore uh-oh yeah but where we camp there there's a you know little bit of a inlet where we park the boats and stuff so real early in the morning before it gets hot and then you know right at dusk uh-huh um down in the trees down there boy all those little sunfish come up and they'll go down there while i'm cooking dinner and just start reeling those little babies in and they ha ve more fun with that right huh what do they use for bait oh usually i'll buy them a thing of worms or a lot of times i'll just give them a piece of bacon and they're taught they'll tear up bacon and stick it i mean those they'll they'll bite empty hooks that's what's so funny yeah good grief and when we're out chasing the big stripers we use those perch for bait yeah use the little ones for bait yeah why not yeah it's great oh me but we just love it up there in fact Jamie wanted to go up this weekend with it being fourth of July weekend but uh i can't put the tent up and all that kind of stuff quite yet i'm still pretty sore fourth of July yeah oh me so anyway but have you been um salt water fishing i haven't really done any of that uh and oddly enough uh Jackie's parents live on the the Carolina beach in North Carolina and and we've i guess we went out one time right oh my goodness and just fished you know from the shore like in the winter you know one Christmas trip uh-huh but other than that that's really been it yeah they uh i've always wanted to actually go out in the boat i think i went out on a a snapper party boat in the Gulf once upon a time but uh and i was i was too sick to yeah uh-huh to to enjoy that right  okay you have three boys i had two boys and two girls right my youngest is college age but he is so he's still around occasionally but um he's he's twenty two and in his last year of college but uh we were very active with them when they were young whatever they were in gymnastics or soccer or baseball or basketball whatever we were always involved in the parent club and coached some and went to all the games and and course in Plano that's a big deal we'd even where we lived in Albuquerque before there's a lot of parent involvement in children's lives how about where you are that's good well i try i try to as much as possible um my oldest is nine he plays plays soccer and is getting ready to start playing football oh oh my and uh i'm behind him a hundred percent on that and right and my my middle one is five he's playing soccer and T-ball oh dear my youngest is two and he wants to do it all so yeah he's learning from the big brothers huh that's neat though and sometimes those that see their older brothers do it turn out to be pretty good because they pick up skills yeah that's that's right seems naturally you know just they start so young just kicking the ball and are are you pretty involved with with their uh that's true i try to be as much as i can do you coach them or go out to parent nights oh no i i uh go out to as many games as i can get to uh-huh uh-huh it's kind of hard hard hard with me just because i'm in the restaurant business and i have to work weekends but my wife's there all the time and oh mean that's that's one of my that's my downfall on my side of that that that aspect um-hum um-hum which is i think's a lot of people's too just in general right is that is there that everybody's working you know the the dad's away at work and then the then the wife goes away to work and kids are stuck with sitters and they're not involved in there as much with their their with their kids they let somebody else raise their kids right right right it well that's seems to be a a pretty current trend i i work in the schools and i see a lot of kids that what obviously are looking for a family and usually find it within a group at school rather than at home because their parents are off working or uh usually you know a lot of times it's a single mother trying to raise and of course i i deal with adolescents so that's where it fourteen fifteen that's where it really starts coming out this lack of of uh family life what do you what do you what difference do you see in those kids that than ones with a mother and father in the participation well uh they look for their security and their uh self-esteem uh outside of the home and usually in the wrong groups really and and uh acceptance right and they find that they're very easily unfortunately uh the kids who make them feel the most welcome right when new students come into school are the kids that are are uh on drugs or party a lot on weekends and things like that and and uh yeah wrong side of the fence they're the first but they are the first ones that will come up and say you know you want to sit at my table in the cafeteria and let me help you to your classes and things like that and and uh right when you've got a a child that's just coming from a situation a move is a terrible thing on a child it's it's just such a traumatic especially if they've lived for any length of time oh sure i mean the in in the first place and they come up here and no friends and here are these people just throwing themselves and before you know it you've got a a kid involved in things you don't want them involved in and it and most of the time the move is made and then mom and daddy go right back to work right away and the kid's coming home to an empty house or they're coming home to take care of little brothers and sisters and and uh you've got these ready made friends just ready to go that that's right and and uh i you i don't know what the answer is because i am a working woman and and i don't like to say if the women would stay home any more than i like to say if the men would stay home and and it's right well you're fortunate that uh your kids are grown and i mean did did you did you work when your kids were growing up right when when my youngest was in third grade i went back to work but i stayed home up until then when by that time my oldest was right oh she's about six years older than he is so she must have been in about uh tenth grade i guess my oldest was and i had one in tenth and one in ninth and one in eighth and then this third grader and and uh right but i went to work for the school district where i was home in the summer i had two weeks off at Christmas i got left school at three four o'clock every day and was home to take them to anything they needed to go to in the afternoons did you work in the school or in the administrative end of it uh no in the schools i i uh i did work some summers but it was never my work never took uh first place if if my kids needed me or needed to go somewhere that's where i was it right just did you work at the same school that your kid was going through and um i when my youngest was in elementary school i worked at in his elementary school for three years right and uh but i had an understanding with the principal that under no circumstances was i to be treated any differently i don't want i said i don't want teachers coming to me in the middle of the day when they couldn't get to anybody else's mother in the middle of the day that that it would be handled the same way they handled dealt with other parents other kids it it gets real easy when a mother is in a school or a father even for a teacher to every time some little thing goes wrong to run and pretty soon all you're hearing is negative things so it you know and those things need to be dealt with in the classroom by the teacher and not tattled necessarily right right well it puts you it puts you in an awkward situation puts the child in an awkward situation but it it it worked well it worked well with me and i and i told the principal i said if if uh my student my child does something that you feel deserves licks or some other discipline have at it you know i'm i'm i have always right wanted them to respect rules and teachers and and uh i don't want them to think that i'm going to come riding to the rescue where every time something happens but well they need to i mean any any child as far as that goes there's that there's that certain there's that that fine line between A and C you know that you have you need to ride and all kids do they they need discipline right well i think unfortunately what what we're seeing in the very few of the instances is that uh for the parents who cannot be there to parent during the day their idea of parenting is to come riding to the rescue and take their child's side without knowing the whole story or even when they do know the whole story right it's it's either another student's fault or it's another it's a teacher's fault or it's it's anybody's and they consider that being a good parent and that what when really what the child needs is their attention more of the time and it's well that's usually what gets them in trouble to begin with not enough attention not enough attention like you were saying they go off into the wrong groups and get hooked up with the wrong people so um-hum um-hum um-hum it it it's and it's it's difficult i understand i i know a lot of single women that are working two jobs just to keep a roof over the kid's head and keep food on the table and i don't know how these women are supposed to have time to to parent it's it's i don't i don't know what the answer is to it it's it's really sad i there may not be i but it it beats being it beats being homeless you know and you don't know if there is one there may not i mean it's just an ongoing ongoing problem right  hello hello hi my name is Leslie hi Leslie i'm Carol hi Carol where you from uh Plano Texas oh you're kidding so am i oh well we're right here in town then maybe we know each other yeah you're not from choir are you uh oh Leslie who Leslie French okay what choir are you from uh Christ United Methodist well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by Judy Dillon oh okay i'm in the soprano parts you're a soprano well i well we can chitchat easily without any sweat then yeah what a hoot i i'd forgotten about this thing i have been so bad oh good well i have too i have too and i obviously it's working now i should oh i guess so i've only had uh one other chance at this thing and i will do better well okay Leslie what are we gonna discuss Leslie we're supposed to discuss food and cooking fine and uh did it describe it to you at all well it i was hunting for all of my stuff and every time i pressed a button they were already talking by the time my phone clicked back in yeah i have a cordless phone that doesn't do well okay well and it says uh which foods would you recommend for uh a menu for a dinner party and then maybe we can share a recipe with what they kind of what it kind of said great we can do that i don't care what you serve i'll let you go first you're in charge of the call you ready to press one uh yeah okay let i'm pressing one right now okay go okay well i was thinking about if i did a dinner party right now i'd do a Mexican Mexican fare of sorts because that's about the only thing i'm creative at and uh what kind of things would you put on it well for appetizers i'd start with the you know the typical cheese nachos and uh melt the cheese over the chips and uh put some green pepper or i mean chili peppers on top of that for those who like it hot and then another good good um recipe for appetizers is uh bean dip i don't know if you've ever done that but you put just the uh refried beans and then a layer of uh um-hum of sour cream oh that seven layer dip well it doesn't really have seven layers mine doesn't anyway and then i put like a layer of cheese and then some salsa on top of everything and then you just use it for dipping your chip into and okay okay you that's a wonderful recipe yeah it's real good and then a what would you use for your main course probably go with fajitas oh yeah uh season up some good chicken and beef and chop up a whole bunch of things so that they could kind of pick and choose what they like and that's an easy way to please everybody yeah yeah that way if there's something that they don't want then they can just simply leave it off on their own that's right that's a good idea so i haven't done many dinner parties though lately i've just been uh well i'm a very casual informal person so most of my quote dinner parties um-hum would probably be very laid back we'd probably do ribs or chicken or something like that on the grill put with corn on the cob and maybe a tossed salad fresh fruit that type of a thing yeah um-hum i'm a i'm a lover of paper plates in the summer time and disposable plastic forks throw them away for an easy cleanup yeah uh-huh uh-huh so i i'm afraid i'm not a real fancy sit down kind of use your best china oh dinner party kind yeah that's me too in fact we don't even have our dining table yet so i guess we've been pretty casual for most of everything so well my life is kind of casual so my dinner parties would be also well speaking of dinner parties are we still doing this uh um well what's a good potluck for eight to ten people what do you yeah we you know what i was planning on doing i didn't know if it was needed but was a salad i mean that's i didn't know if it had to be a casserole of sorts it can be anything okay it can be anything i i may just bring fresh fruit because i know everybody will eat that even though it's not okay you know someone'll bring a meat yeah yeah if not we go meatless i don't care yeah we don't we don't we eat too meach too much meat at dinner parties anyhow that's right yeah it's kind a yeah yeah well that's that's my my love of if i'm not going to have a full meal is to make sure i get a good salad in there and a good you know thing of fruit and that that'll satisfy most anybody so i think they always go over well yeah okay how long we supposed to talk on this about three minutes i hope i think we've probably discussed all they need to discuss yeah okay well then if we're done it's all we do is just say good-bye right well okay i've enjoyed talking to you and i if i have a Mexican dinner at anytime i'll do i think i'll run your yours by and have fajitas and bean dip and the whole nine yards yeah i'll get yeah yeah sounds good nice talking to you bye-bye okay i've enjoyed talking to you bye  well Tom just tonight i was working on my car out of necessity and i had uh uh had a long age old problem of my bright lights not working uh this is the type of uh switch where you flip the the lever the turn signal on the column yeah and when i would uh put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely which is even worse than them just not getting bright exactly and i had presumed that it was the switch and uh this is uh an older car it's a seventy two MG so i had to mail order the part uh which i had done and tonight i went out and uh at least hooked in the new part only to discover that that apparently is not the problem it's not in the switch because it does the same thing with the new switch oh so i'll be faced with having to return that product and uh hoping that uh you know that they will accept it although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used did did did you do the diagnosis or or was it just an assumption that that's probably the part that failed uh i had done what diagnosis i could primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car uh-huh and uh pretty much decided that that had to be the problem i talked to one mechanic about it and he suspected the switch also uh but i've not you know i really don't know what the problem might be it it the other switch could be the main switch itself uh that turns the lights on or off which is on the dashboard uh-huh uh it might be tied into the equation somehow but uh yeah i know uh when working with the uh flashers there is uh usually a a special fuse that operates the flashers do you have a separate fuse for your high beam as opposed to your low beam i i don't know i should look at that i don't remember seeing one in the uh in the the diagram but i'll have to go back and look at that diagram yeah i don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse i know sometimes when you think there are uh things running while they're at the same unit like the headlamp uh-huh you tend to think well there's one fuse operating the whole thing but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires uh the use of a of a maybe a higher fuse yeah that's a good idea so that's a possibility what i've typically found when that uh companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all and i hope that that's the case this time is this a a mail order parts house that specializes in in parts for uh old imports right exactly it's out of uh Kansas um um so it's not J C Whitney or somebody like that somewhere no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but it is not either it's obviously doesn't quite fit so it must be for a different year so i'll have to try to return that as well yeah have you found any uh uh reliable import service people in the metroplex well i had one person that i used for years and years on this car because i've owned this car since it was new and uh but it's over like in the Brook Hollow industrial district down on Stemmons and Inwood area oh yeah uh-huh and i hadn't used him for some years and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized instead of uh all import cars he has narrowed it down to where he only works on uh German cars and German cars i'm not sure that he works on much else at all but he doesn't work on British cars any more and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it i'll be darned so uh uh i may have to check with that person as it turns out that one that shop is near where i now work so i'll uh i should be able to take it in and check that part out i've not had to to exchange any other parts recently uh because they were defective now i've had had pretty good luck i just however did uh have to get a a uh one of these jam box portable dual cassette players uh repaired i'd purchased it at at Sam's and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty and i should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt uh-huh because uh i didn't take it in right away and let a whole year go by uh some of the buttons didn't work right where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play and as it turned out it had a full year's warranty and i could have gotten it repaired for free but i had to take it in while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost oh my goodness uh but it didn't do me any good because i had i had missed the window by about a week or two so i didn't even i didn't really uh even bring it up when i went in to pick it up oh no but uh that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect well ours wasn't within the last year i guess it's been within the last two years Judy has an Oldsmobile that we bought new and it's one with the uh electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer and uh i don't know what else it all controls but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort and we found that the uh uh we were having two problems it was idling fast when you first started the engine to the point that we park on a hill under our car port and when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley and knowing that you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard otherwise it would just wrench control away from you good grief and the other problem Judy would have is occasionally she would uh be driving along uh decelerating like coming to a stop sign but not yet stopped at the stop sign and the engine would just quit uh-huh so we took it back to the uh Oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing so they adjusted timing and the problem didn't go away so we ended up taking it back again i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around but the second time around they looked at their uh recall service and their uh service reports from region or headquarters whatever and and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error in the uh computer control unit which fortunately they replaced under warranty because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part huh my goodness and uh so once they replaced it then the the car seemed to work fine huh for a considerable period of time and now it seems to be we don't we're not experiencing the stalling but we're still experiencing a very uneven  hi good morning do you have recycling in Sachse good morning yes we do we've got um a pickup twice a week that they come out and they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody and they take it uh-huh do oh really and it's twice a week uh-huh really we have recently started uh a bin program here in Plano where uh used to be we we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up and now they have uh these large green containers and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet but they're but they're planning on doing it very soon apparently the trucks that they had um lined up they needed the parts for Saudi Arabia and so that put off the program for a while but uh do you recycle oh um uh my kids do put it that way they they've been recycling cans for extra money so that's that's been their summer money and they're fixing to go to Disneyland so do they uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh well that's great well that's the way we started too my daughter was going to Camp Goddard um which is through the Plano school system you know in the fall so yeah uh-huh couple of years ago and she had to earn money for it and she was too young to babysit so that's how she started she started recycling cans and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and uh aluminum cans and plastics uh-huh uh-huh really is is is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go and they weigh it or whatever and no the the only thing we get paid for are the aluminum cans um the rest of it we just do because um my husband has become hooked on recycling and so you know we don't get paid for that but that's okay you know that it's it's not that much of a bother really you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever and we use a lot of two liter bottles yeah um and like milk cartons and things like that it's amazing how much plastic you generate yeah i was amazed at how many cans that we got uh because when the kids first went down i said that you know that's great and i was thinking you know maybe i'd help supplement it you know when they turned them in but yeah yeah uh-huh its amazing how many cans you go through yeah it really is yeah it really is well all that stuff and how much how much we have reduced and how fast they accumulate our waste you know that we we're generating a week um uh-huh i know our neighbors when we first went to this bin program said oh there's no way you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week they were real upset but they weren't they were only picking up once a week and we said to them if you recycle you'll you'll you know you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container and uh it's it's really amazing the other thing he does that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings yeah really no he he got a little mulcher thing it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower uh-huh and we mow once a week you know no no more often then that and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay on the on on the um on the lawn and it's amazing it's amazing we don't collect any of that and that that has cut down a lot in what we throw out yeah well well we don't ever we don't catch it either mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard so if it mows gets mowed i do it normally and i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it it's too heavy uh-huh yeah so i just mow i just mow it and leave it and it just soaks in yeah sure it does sure it does it really does and it actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer if you're not uh if you're catching your grass clippings that that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn it's amazing uh-huh yeah oh i like it better doing it well one it cuts down on my mow time anyway and you zip through it quicker yeah yeah uh-huh that's true that's true that's true well i i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it probably we probably will it's it's really not that much trouble we keep a large plastic uh just a you know a garbage bag in the garage yeah and as soon as we use something you know we crush it up and put it out there and then you know every few weeks we have recycling a recycling center like near Wal-Mart they're they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in and it's really no trouble uh-huh and uh i feel like at least we're doing something yeah you know uh um i read a book one time or a magazine a magazine article and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution it seems like a small contribution but it's not if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers they would save save thousands and thousands of trees a day really a day just from not throwing out your newspapers and uh when you read that you think well gee maybe it is a big deal you know what what makes me sick is is when they show the the dump sites uh-huh you know and and how big they are or like in New York the barges that that go up and down the the river and they don't have any place to put it and it just floats in the and it's like ugh uh-huh yes yeah yeah yeah yeah and that's and that's really not necessary no it really isn't if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference it would make a huge impact so i'm excited about the recycling program in Plano i i can't wait for them to get it started um because that it'll be that much easier for us you know like i said now we have to take it over to to Wal-Mart it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up um yeah it it's it's convenient out here for them to do now what what do they pick up it's just they pick up the the plastic the glass and the newspaper uh-huh oh they do uh-huh and do you have to sort that or do you just put it all in and they will do the aluminum no you just put it in the one bin and and i guess they do the sorting but um they'll do the aluminum cans too but we don't give them those the kids keep those so right right so you're doing that now you're doing the newspapers and the glass oh uh-huh uh-huh well we don't we don't take the newspaper to begin with when neither one of us are home to to read it so we don't have the newspapers but the the plastic and the glass uh-huh uh-huh at first when it first started it it it was hard you know because you're just used to throwing everything uh-huh my husband would come home and go through the trash and say uh you threw this away you know he would get he would get all upset and i'd say it's just such an automatic reaction and now we think before we throw anything away i mean it's really funny we we really it is once you get into the habit of it it's okay it's just it's just making it a habit that's hard oh i know well the kids have even got to the point where they if they see anybody going in the trash can with a can you know they they're oh no don't do that and they go to the sink they rinse them out and they put them upside down they let them drain and and then uh after a couple of days uh-huh they take them all outside and i put them in a big bag anyway and then they dump the bag out and then they crush them so that's their activity thing they go out there and crush so uh-huh uh-huh tha t's fun yeah yeah yeah oh that's a lot of fun that's a lot of fun well that's great well i'm to hear you're doing that yeah i my sister was here recently from Connecticut and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans oh really  we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and and making the decision on a family basis and probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process well not so much personally but my um husband has an aunt who has been like a second mother i mean always lived in the same town and took care of him and such they live down in College Station where his parents do too and they put her in a home last year she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to uh not be able to be in her apartment on her own uh-huh uh-huh so they found a a place nearby that they put her in last year so it was pretty much a physical decision uh yeah although she is uh in pretty good health and she's doesn't take any medication it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point um then she was starting to get uh you know lose memory sometimes and which is kind of frightening when she's in the car yeah my husband's family are reaching that point but it's it's so difficult was she in favor of it or or was she uh well yeah when it finally came down to it um she just got to the point after the i mean it wasn't a very um strong stroke it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore kind of opposed to it uh-huh and she got kind of fearful of being on her own she never really ate very well it was one thing she hardly ever took care of herself and she didn't eat she ate very poor so i think she was you know bad uh nutrition on top of yeah and uh she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore so so often i think though elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad i work with a lot of elderly people i'm a trust officer um and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating very much or very balanced meals well she was almost ridiculous like she'd eat ice cream and cookies yes well you know that's part of the aging process that your taste buds goes back to the sweet taste it really is yeah uh-huh she'd didn't one oh really well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore oh that's too much trouble that's too much trouble didn't want to cook yeah and the portions people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals i do that right now and i'm not near nursing home age yeah although they've got uh Meals On Wheels which i understand is a really good you know way to handle that so that at least they eat yeah um-hum so as a family you all just visited nursing homes or probably in College Station there wasn't a whole lot of choice no i don't think there was um i know a little bit more from a a coworker her mother-in-law had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in um-hum um she was ambulatory and so there was a lesser care uh then she got uh uh hip broken and then uh she wasn't as ambulatory so they were almost you know to the point of saying she can't be here anymore but um-hum i remember from her checking around she ended up staying at the Arkansas House i think out in Arlington something like that uh-huh and uh you know the type of facilities whether it's a shared room or two separate rooms that share uh a uh bathroom all of them all seem to say that people there are going to steal their items oh yeah that's a given they they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half senile um-hum and sometimes the the help there does it i think hum so they they uh don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items very limited space waste but um at least they all seem to have some um-hum you know people that monitor their uh medication intake and dining facilities you know go to the dining room and and eat some good meals i know when my friend's mother-in-law first went in i mean um-hum very antisocial maybe it takes a while for them to say okay well i'll be with other people but adapt yeah yeah i don't understand that they they don't want to be with anybody else i as i think i mentioned i was in the trust business and i've seen so many elderly people usually there has to be some wealth involved which is great if if you're financially if if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money but uh-huh the the places like Presbyterian Village and some of the the retirement places where where they have different levels of care seems to be so much better as far as elderly people adapting they're able to move in while they're still independent and still social and and they do group things uh-huh and then as health or or mental capacity deteriorates they're able to take the next steps without so much change and oh i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in it's really kind of difficult yeah i have a um my aunt's mother is uh gotten ill recently and uh she lives in Pennsylvania they live in Alabama and they're saying hey we need you to be closer and yeah you have uh women like that i don't to men it seems like the women out just out live their husbands but very reluctantly that whole i mean they don't get out of the house they don't socialize but it's my home and i don't want to leave it uh-huh well and it's the first step in in actually accepting that you are failing and and aging um you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on and and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed to make the change um they they became in fact that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision and that scares me the the thought of forcing somebody to do something but it's it's so lonely you know they can't get out and see anyone and i mean it's hard for for someone like me to understand that because i think i think what do you have there it's a house it's walls and it's furniture but yeah uh-huh not as independence there's nobody there don't you want to be close to me yeah i mean you know be with other people i just don't understand why they so much want to just stay in that building and there's no family there they don't get to see their grandkids they don't get to see their children they just there in that house uh-huh uh-huh yeah and the quality of life really isn't there yeah oh it's tough it really is that's from the child's standpoint the child is going why don't you want to be close to me and your other family what does that house got attraction i never really thought of independence uh-huh well they fear being dependent on somebody they they fear being a burden to to family members uh my husband's mother will have major surgery and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation she'll let something slip and we'll say wait a minute and and that's it she just well i didn't want to bother you she can't accept that we want to be the care givers well when she got home who took care of her yeah well she stayed she stayed in a temporary nursing home until she was okay ah you know it's just but it's frightening to us b ecause we live pretty far from her she's down in Temple and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on um-hum um so it's difficult it really is and we're all heading that way and yeah my husband and i we have been thinking about his folks are in College Station and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the Dallas area and uh-huh there's nothing to hold them there in College Station since they're retired so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here yeah  well hi Nola this is Vic uh do you have any hobbies that uh that you really participate in um most of my hobbies include three three little girls oh they keep me pretty busy is that right i uh we're home schooling uh-huh so i um am real involved in learning how to teach and teaching and that kind of thing um i'm also we're expecting a baby in August so i've been trying to get some things in the house organized for that uh-huh and have repainted a couple of chairs and repainted a dresser and some of that kind of thing um oh do you have uh as part of your home schooling do you have any like uh handicraft type things that you've done with with your children um yeah we do different things uh i sew so uh i haven't had a lot of time for it for a little while but um uh-huh that's one thing that we do do some of um i uh-huh do you actually sew some clothes for them and that sort of stuff or have you before oh yeah yeah um i oh that's good have i can do lots of things and i enjoy lots of different things i don't have a lot time for most of them but when i do i like uh i like art i like uh uh-huh the sewing um let's see what else i can do you know lots of different things like cross-stitch and different things but i just don't spend that much time on it uh quilting right um i've made quilts for the girls' beds and things like that um well that's nice something they can keep for a long time and enjoy later on yeah something to cover them and keep them warm keep them warm that's always beneficial too that's right yeah um well i think most of my hobbies are i don't really have any handicrafts that i can speak of i've done some woodworking type things but uh uh i don't really consider yard work a hobby either i guess it's uh i think it could be i do a little bit of gardening yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby yeah it's more tedious yeah but um i'm interested in music so i do a few things in that regard oh what do you do well i uh uh my children are uh learning to play the piano oh wonderful and it's been ages ago since i played but i still like to sit down and and play around with the piano myself some and i have twelve year old daughter that's far surpassed any ability that i ever have had huh um i would love for my girls to take piano lessons but we've been unemployed for a while so i haven't had a chance to do that so yeah and uh also there's an instrument of all things called a recorder uh and i i play that some just by ear i don't and music on that uh-huh oh uh-huh i used to play the clarinet and i still have one or actually recently just got another one and uh i play it from time to time as well you're more interested interested in the instruments then in voice well i am in a a church choir in fact it's that organization that uh it is doing this fund raising using uh uh the T I thing for that for that for that as a matter of fact and that's that's why i'm enrolled in this is our choir is doing it so that that i can pass a good bit of time and i do enjoy that a great deal the T I thing oh that's neat uh-huh um and i bike i bike ride i guess that's really the closest thing to a bonafide hobby that i have uh-huh just a sort of combination between bicycling and exercise or hobby and an exercise so that's probably the extent of my hobbies uh-huh i've enjoyed music too um i was in choirs from fifth grade on i think and um and uh had just a little piano a little violin i even had a little bagpipe at one time did you really well that's different yeah in in ninth grade our high school is Northern Highlands in New Jersey uh-huh and they uh they they just that year they began teaching bagpipe for the to put together group for oh you had to play the yeah it was fun it was interesting i bet that was that's very different yeah uh but uh we all enjoy music too um i don't know if they want us to specifically to do more on the craft side or well i'm not sure that it really matters a whole lot at all probably not that's sort of been my interpretation of of these conversations um in fact i think we probably uh have talked long enough yeah cause would be my guess so i don't i don't know how long we've gone but yeah oh i'm sure it's been adequate so i enjoyed talking with you okay nice to talk to you too and and good luck with your children okay thank you bye-bye all right bye-bye  okay um well i guess first of all i i could have asked that before do you have children no no okay because i i didn't know if that would make a difference in how you felt um what what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two yeah i think it's a good idea i think everybody should should uh put in their time so to speak for the for the good of the the nation and for the good of themselves i think it's uh would everyone everyone grow up and mature and and realize what this country's all about yeah i just um i guess that's my that's something that my family has always believed strongly in and um i had opportunities in high school to work in some programs um did you oh and and i agree with what you said that it's uh it benefits the person doing it so much i don't think they realize and i uh uh-huh i i think it gives you a better perspective on life and uh it gives you a little bit uh more a glimpse of the the real world and and it would certainly help the country too uh yeah really yeah i think that's probably like uh quite a few things that that the kids uh maybe not so much nowadays but used to go through you know they just they were they did things for people yeah yes you know for their communities for their their uh families for their friends where now i'm not sure they really do yeah well i think sometimes through groups and organizations um my first when i first thought of it i thought it uh when they asked the question i thought well that sounds wonderful and then i wondered if people were unwilling but but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long um but i do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um um-hum they do still have opportunities yeah that's probably true but i i think that's a small uh number that could you know but even even through those groups groups do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to no um not since um not as much as i remember growing up and that was something uh i think in the fifties and sixties um seemed more common in the last two decades um-hum yeah i think that's probably true but i think it's probably more true still still in the in the smaller communities then in the larger cities yes yeah where uh where abouts do you live what part of the country well i live in Richardson right now which is just oh okay we're in Plano so we're not far apart one of the calls i'd gotten before was uh down to Austin and and i know right yeah okay sure a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest so i know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area yeah gosh i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area but you're right yeah but i grew up in a real small town in Florida oh i mean a real small town and uh i think it was just of course it was back in the in the fifties and i think it was real prevalent back then i i think people thought more of others than they do now you know yeah as far as doing things for them and and then gaining benefits from it well and maybe um maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back um if we've lost some of that and it it seems in the last decade or two um that's true maybe that's a way if if young people had to do it um uh-huh maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things i always thought was a wonderful part of our country um yeah i do to i do to is helping others i'm not sure that that today's kids would go for it though i think you would have to start younger yeah you know i i don't know how young you'd have to go but i think by the time they're oh early teenagers anyway i think it's too late now at least around here um yeah i think uh i think it does help um even preschoolers you know they're um things even just starting around the home you know little ones can do a little bit to help the family right um-hum and and just watching the parents do things too um it can start a pattern there's always something no matter how young and then that helps develop that attitude um i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more you know i think this is certainly a possible way um to handle it but i wish ah that's something that i think that has been lost in families and i think that's a good place to start again uh yeah i would have to start in the families first because if you don't it for your for your own immediate family your sure not going to do it for anybody else yeah and i do think um the schools do try and do something even with food drives and um sometimes what Richardson and Plano both i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is i mean that's uh uh-huh gosh i'm sure not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas and uh that's probably true that's probably true it's i know our church youth group um starts with projects young but they they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia area every year they've done this for fourteen years now um-hum oh that's great um and it is it's um and they've also see that there's there's a different way of life and those families are really close some of the things that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there and um um-hum it really every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed and it's changed their perspective and and that's just the two two weeks during during the summer so if two weeks um could have that kind of effect i would um-hum well that's that's great i'm glad that there are still some areas that think uh that that get the youth involved in that sort of thing you know like i said i think it does well that's even even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference in their attitudes yes well well i guess um did you have anything else that no i i guess that's about all okay okay well i i enjoyed talking with you well good talking with you and i hope you have a good evening thanks bye bye you too okay bye  okay i guess we're supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldn't be too much trouble for the two of us right no as many years as we've been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems they're not a lot of problems where i teach right but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems uh with dropouts um when i was in Minnesota last summer um-hum there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didn't know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didn't even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis um-hum and uh they just didn't come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school that's really sad isn't it right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades um-hum but then the follow-up the next day was i was kind of glad to see because it it said that you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible you know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors i think so too you know like what are their plans after high school you know and what's their home situation you know that the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that the main goal is making money now right right and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right right sure but there can still be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of what's wrong with the public schools my my first impulse impulse was your education it isn't really what's wrong with the public public schools it's what's wrong with families that's right it's what's wrong with families and if if children come to school and society in general yes insecure and their more biggest concern is survival right both at home they don't know what to expect at home they don't feel secure there they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex for example that child that was shot right right uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think that's the main problem right yeah and school's now are supposed to solve social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and that's overwhelming hm yeah well we've got um you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor and that's just really not enough no it isn't and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because that's when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve help them to work through their problems while they're littler then they won't have as many problems up there true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didn't even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and really they divided them up between three counselors but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor and they decided that didn't work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees yeah um-hum they they do that here through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that um-hum would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they don't um-hum i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens to change yeah right but it is frightening but yes it certainly is because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another than what are we going to do with them what's going to happen to them are they going to be yeah that's right able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good yeah right i'm on that um campus strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the uh-huh uh you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value then i think they decided to strike economic anyway you know the point was what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if if most people are going to private schools well i think uh one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world right right where they don't try to educate everyone that's one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone um-hum that's right that's right we're the only country in the world that does um-hum um-hum and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if they're willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that um-hum yeah and one of the Plano school district's you know goal is that they will graduate every child that um that is here in the ninth grade i believe it's something like that it's worded and um i don't know well you know if we can keep them in school right that's then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too so important oh gosh well that new movie that new movie out i hm really really a frightening situation i guess we're both lucky it's scary to me i we are to be in situations and schools where we don't see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother was is was teacher for years and year s and um they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about the you know the school situation there too so well shall we wrap it up um i would imagine that we've talked the amount of time necessary I think we have to so i'll see you when we see you okay all right we were in uh Austin yesterday the reason i was in the church um-hum and we went to hear uh James Win ensemble concert they left this morning for England oh oh how exciting oh that is wonderful what an experience isn't wonderful uh-huh and uh the university  okay do you have you ever had to put your children in in child care Mary Dell oh yes i'm an old experienced hand i started back when it wasn't stylish to do that at all my daughter that's seventeen now uh-huh i worked even when she was a baby oh and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two and then i was really lucky to have put them in a Methodist day school at Preston Hollow Methodist uh-huh right off of Walnut Hill and Preston and it was a wonderful environment i i just wish all kids if they have to be put in day school could have that kind of place uh-huh uh-huh i see so it worked well how about you oh well i have uh a nine year old and a six year old and neither one of them has ever been in in uh day care for the reason of of me working but uh they both went through preschool uh-huh uh-huh yeah and uh we've just been real lucky i think anyway to not uh-huh it's not hard to find anything that's part-time so many of the churches have really strong right like half day programs uh-huh preschool and children's day out but it was a nightmare back when Cheryl was little and this is one of the few churches that did it there were a couple downtown Dallas uh-huh but they were so seemed cold and impersonal i just couldn't hack it uh-huh and what i liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two which was fifteen years ago many of them are still there today so there was real continuity she went back as a teenager and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there oh oh my gosh so it it was really neat but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love and she just kept good people and uh-huh oh my goodness real cheerful place lots of arts and crafts and i'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that right right yeah that if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff uh-huh yeah that is um a big drawback i think in that in the uh public schools out here uh-huh you know to your lucky to have an art teacher and if you do you get them once a week or something you know or pay for it after school our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art and oh is that right i had no idea you know i willingly did it but i thought this makes me angry this is something that ought to be in the schools oh my goodness rather than some of the other stuff they do yeah and with our budget cuts i'm sure that's not going to well that's the only way they're yeah that's the only way they're going to be able to do it and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that so in some ways i think the the day schools do serve those purposes not going to change anytime soon oh my goodness yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten you know it's like wham culture shock it's just yeah yeah put the colors away which is too bad yeah yeah get the computers out and you know well that's hard it's so difficult for them um uh-huh uh-huh did you have your children did you say in home in in private care was that in your home or in someone else's home until they were two yeah yeah both times they were at our house uh-huh so you were able to have somebody come there and that was hard too i i lucked out with really good people both times but i know so many people that are never able to find that and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it so yeah yeah yeah did you have a nanny or did you have someone that lived in with you yeah well no she didn't live with us uh the first one was an elderly lady who was putting a a daughter through nursing school just purely on babysitting money oh oh my goodness and she kept Cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had because both our parents are dead uh-huh yeah oh so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with Emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so oh gosh uh-huh uh-huh i have uh a i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center uh-huh i was just listening to a program this morning oh well i guess it was on the Home Show but they were talking about uh a new uh oh i can't even think of the name of it i was halfway listening while i was painting um it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children um-hum um-hum and they've now moved it to Washington DC and the the doctor that was on there the pediatrician said you know i can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day care and leaving them there yeah oh that would be hard you know so um well they give a lot more leave i work at NCNB now and our benefits for maternal and and parental care and even for elderly people or uh-huh are really expanding we have more options now then we did when i my kids were born with being able to take off full-time longer of you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time uh-huh oh boy that's great for up to six months it's really neat i've i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week or they've you know whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint uh-huh uh-huh we try to work it with their hours and that helps because you don't have to just wean wean yourself cold turkey and say okay i never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again yeah right right and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals i've of course it's too late for me so i've i've not tried them to see how effective they are but yeah uh-huh uh-huh i think we're finally beginning to make progress but just not very fast gosh it's amazing and for our age group it's too late too little too late right right but i i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work two income families i think are here to stay uh-huh uh-huh well and i would think you know since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do uh-huh you know the the people that work in big business have families they have children so it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and working and uh right yeah oh sure you retain employees and keep them longer that's that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our Employee Assistance Programs that uh-huh uh-huh well they want us to be happy and wa nt us to be able to cope with trying to split ourselves in fifteen million pieces right right right so i i hope it helps it seems to help the new mothers not have to come back full-time because that's hard oh that's good that's good to know i got a couple of friends that have have found the uh you know a private a private home to take their children to when they're young until they hit the preschool age and they uh-huh uh-huh usually you know you'll find a a woman that's keeping like six children or four to six children in the home and my future future sister-in-law's mother does that too full-time uh-huh well in Plano though the problem is you find and this is what i found with Emily i from the time she started first grade i wanted her out in Plano area uh-huh and i kept finding neighbors and friends and they'd move she ended up being in a different home every year oh too transit uh-huh and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move so this year i i tried KinderCare and then she's old enough to and her surroundings too yeah  okay i i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much uh gardening we do lawn work all the time but uh our gardening we lost remember the last two freezes i don't know how long you've been here yeah i do but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones and so as far as our bushes we don't have any but we do have some blackberry bushes and and they were really hearty and stayed on and we've done really well with them oh really did you plant those yourself um-hum yeah and so they've been really good and the kids i had to the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries oh but uh we go out it it's hard to go out when it's this hot uh-huh and uh but uh keep the weeds out of them and and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them and they're okay oh yeah um that's nice i i love blackberries and we we uh when i was smaller we my family lived in Tennessee and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick my brother and i uh-huh but i don't have any down here yeah yeah uh we have some flowers that have they just are real hearty also and they're bulbs and they come up every year but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out and uh there a i don't know what kind of flowers they are they're real common around here they're they're orange and they look like a lily sort of uh oh i think i know what they i can't remember what the name of them is are are either yeah no but i think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in they they keep the the rain on the outside little rain drops and and they look real pretty after the rain oh and so i really like them but i need to get out and and um do that now as far as our grass it grows crazy it just keeps growing and growing and uh sometimes my husband does it and sometimes my son does it but it just is i don't i don't know i've lived in Utah my whole life and we can't seem to get ours green i don't know yeah down here the grass well i'm uh we've had problems with our yard we it was one big weed is what it was it was just horrible and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns and we have this God awful ugly thing and uh-huh crappy i know we have that too and i know they must think you know i wish those people would do something about their yard but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff that that seems to be helping and he put it on the front yard to see how you know it would do and stuff before he put it on the backyard but we've got a Great Dane in the back and she has eaten everything i have put out there she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees uh-huh uh-huh oh dear i know and she's eaten the bushes i've tried to i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there and i barricaded it up so she couldn't get into it no uh-huh and i went and took a shower and looked back out there and she was already in it and i was so mad had somehow gotten in yeah yeah so i can't do anything back there because she just she destroys it but i've tried out in the front but like you said that that freeze that came uh-huh i had some bushes that uh some shrubs i put put out front and it killed those too so i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing i just don't even want to do anything the the other problem that we have well it's funny because the one the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly they lived and so i don't i don't know i yeah that that happened to us we have these uh so like i wanted to go out and kill them too i know they had no right to live but anyway uh under our trees we get a a north sun and uh the it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them you know we just can't grow uh grass underneath there oh i know ours don't i know we can't either but i've got pretty two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard uh you know one on either side of the yard um-hum and and they're big and they're real full and everything you know in the summer time but it it's killing everything underneath yeah where the leaves are shading the tree but toward the end of the summer you know when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree then the grass starts growing but by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops you know it's it's it's a never ending cycle right it's a vicious cycle isn't it it's really yeah it really is so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and and whatnot so well i don't we've never done anything like this but we've been thinking you know if we built up um you know either a a wood wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt then maybe we could plant some either flowers or or some new bushes in there that would live uh-huh and so i think that we're going to try that i i think the huh i think that's pretty much what we have decided now i have two long windows and i'm trying to decide whether to put like bushes in front of them or not you know maybe just halfway up the window or something like that yeah so people can't see and hear too much it just yeah really and i've cut well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front and they've got mini-blinds and stuff but only only one is really like in the flower bed part and the other one is out on the porch yeah yeah so there's not really much i can do about that that's what our two rooms are on the front too with these long windows one is a bedroom for our our oldest son and one is um an office that my husband and i work in and so i i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that well the flowers are out by the back of the house so and that's where the front room is so that's not too bad but i like to look at the flowers they're pretty yeah i do too that's why i look at my neighbors yard i don't have anything to look at so i look at theirs yeah but it's funny because uh you try so hard i think sometimes to to anyway i do to do our yard and then it's like the wind blows uh-huh everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours to them or and so even if you did get it under control it seems like in just a few months it would all be back and yeah yeah it it's really a pain my husband works a lot so um a lot it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work yeah i'm it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard and uh-huh and i just i really do not appreciate having to go out there and do it i hate to mow the yard more than anything else i hate to mow that yard i know it is it's not my favorite thing in the world either i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now yeah well mine's getting there he helps he does half and i do half so pretty soon though by next year he should be able to do it all by himself uh-huh yeah whether he likes it or not yeah well that is one chore that we will pay him for if he'll go do the yard work out outside so oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him if he'd just go out there and do it and and do it to where i don't have to go back out and redo it that that's my only thing with him yeah right exactly exactly that's why i'm help having him help me now  well uh Cathy do you have any pets in your home we do actually we have a a Golden Retriever a dog and we have a cat and we have we just got two um how nice um-hum Russian Dwarf hamsters which dwarf hamsters lucky us huh dwarf hamsters how big is a dwarf hamster real small they're maybe about oh two inches long they're real small they're real tiny they're cute they really are cute yeah my goodness where did you get those uh my son's baseball coach uh had two and then had multiple hamsters that he was trying to get rid of uh-huh and so that's that's where we got them from now we've been assured they're both males and they're in two separate cages so we don't want any well okay i was going to say that we don't want to go into the dwarf hamster business oh how about you well right now we don't have any pets we've uh we've tried various things we you know obviously do have children uh-huh uh-huh and uh we tried a dog first and we had a a puppy a uh a what did they call him a Westie uh-huh is uh is are they very small uh-huh they're small uh-huh it's a terrier and uh that didn't work out very well oh uh-huh and uh for a variety of reasons but the the dog was just all mouth and teeth it seemed like the only way it could of show affection was by nibbling you on things oh really yeah oh no kidding uh-huh yeah so it it never worked out and uh so we we have we gave up on that and then we tried cats uh-huh and we ended up with a a bad set of cats if that's possible but i'm a i'm a big fan of cats i always had cats growing up oh um-hum are you yeah and uh my wife on the other hand was not a fan of cats at all but we had these two that they we knew someone that uh uh you know wanted to get rid of these kittens and uh-huh uh so we gave it a try and uh they were impossible to house train really boy that's real unusual for cats usually you just put down a litter box and that's the end of that yeah that's the end of that and these it was real strange and uh they were both solid white cats um-hum and uh one had blue eyes and the other had white regular you know yellow eyed cats um-hum um-hum brothers and sisters and we had them declawed and we had them neutered and uh invested all all that money in it into it but uh we simply one of them in particular we just could not uh train to use we tried different types of litter changed it frequently and it was just unbelievable really really huh huh oh and so we finally found someone else that was willing to to to give it a try with them uh-huh and sure enough it it worked worked worked for a little while and then they too couldn't seem to get them to use the litter box really really hum uh so they ended up finding someone else that was willing to give it a try and that's when i lost track of these two cats yeah really yeah yeah oh that's too bad yeah that was that was pretty sad because uh it took a lot of lobbying just to get the cats in the house to begin with so we sure couldn't make another try at it sure sure sure yeah yeah well we were real fortunate with our pets um when my husband and i were getting married we we had both been married before and so we were blending families and we had taken this blended families course through uh P I S T you know they how they have the effective parent parent training effectiveness effectiveness training hum right right and uh so we took a blended families course and Linda Hitt the person who was teaching the course said sometimes when you have children on this side and children on this side you have a you know a mutual child that brings the family together and we looked at each other and laughed and said we'll get a dog and uh yeah i bet that's funny and uh so we i had always wanted a Golden Retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and and whatnot so my husband thought well for Christmas he was going to surprise me with a puppy and he was looking around for a puppy and then um he saw he decided just on a whim i think i'll call the SPCA um-hum and he called the Dallas SPCA and he said you wouldn't happen to have a Golden Retriever would you and they said you won't believe it but we had one dropped off last night good grief and he'd they said he's AKC registered he's two years old and he's going to go fast i'll bet yeah so we thought okay what's wrong with this dog who would give up a two year old Golden Retriever you know that's a nice dog something's got to be wrong with this dog right nothing is wrong with it we have had him now for three years and just love him to death he is wonderful yeah he is he's a great dog he's he's well that's great he makes a real lousy uh watchdog though because he he just loves everybody and he wags his tail and you know he's he's great he's great we just we think he's wonderful and our cat just kind of you know pays us the time of day when he's in the mood and otherwise we don't see him yeah is it primarily outdoor cat then or just yeah he is he comes in and he goes out he's he kind of yeah you know is just around we we don't really don't see him except for feeding time you know or when he wants when he's in the mood for a little affection that's interesting he'll show up huh he'll show up yeah yeah but so that's our family and we just you know uh everybody seems to get along real well the kids the dog and the cat so we're okay um-hum great yeah well has the cat discovered the uh the hamsters yet the hamsters actually it's the dog that is enthralled with the hamsters because the hamsters are recent you know they were just last week oh and the first night we had them somebody knocked over the cage and we thought it was the cat we really did we blamed the cat and we thought the hamster had disappeared and had been eaten but we found him he he just he narrowly escaped with his life but he was found um-hum but since then we have discovered the dog sits and watches them for hours on end oh my goodness you know they'll get going in the little wheel and he'll sit there and just stare at them so i'm wondering now if it really was the cat who knocked them off the shelf it might have been it might have been the dog yeah but the cat doesn't seem to be too bothered with them it's it's the dog that just sits there for hour after hour and watches these hamsters it's it's funny i'll be and my sister has tried that with both hamsters gerbils and small birds yeah yeah uh-huh and it's amazing what their cat has been able to do really i think that pretty much over time has figured out a way to get those small creatures out really eventually to get them out to get the cage down from wherever it is even if it's the top of the refrigerator yeah uh-huh uh-huh to get that cage down and into it somehow yeah yeah well we warned them you the kids you know we said you know with the cat in the house you know these may not last too long um-hum is that right but he doesn't seem to be bothered with them you know he's real content you know chasing flies and birds outside so you know he's he's not too bad um-hum yeah but so are you going to try again with another cat sometime well i would like to we shall see i want it to be a you know indoor outdoor animal next time yeah yeah and uh  okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking alright do you enjoy cooking sometimes not all the time i'm kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time right i don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday yeah that that's about the same boat i'm in too it gets kind of boring yeah how big is the family you cook for uh five uh-huh we have four so and two of them are teenage boys so oh yeah well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so are they and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now it's just the amount that they eat it's just absolutely incredible uh oh yeah well see i my my oldest is nine and he already he already does that yeah does he well and i told him he's going to have to get a part-time job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat yeah that's true uh do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal um favorite recipes that you've come across or my husband and i our favorite meal is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh uh-huh out on the grill uh-huh uh-huh and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and it's real good and uh i do sauteed mushrooms so and asparagus and that's our favorite oh uh-huh ooh yeah ooh that's sound good i love that dinner my husband really likes seafood yeah so do we um and uh i think that no matter what i do i don't serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didn't grow up eating that much seafood and um so i don't know it's just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i don't know one of his favorite things is uh yeah well it's called seafood stew and it's really it's really like a soup soup that that you serve over rice uh-huh and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and it's not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it no no that's kind of Louisiana i think if you do that yeah i don't either i don't know what that i don't see how you eat that but but uh no this is just really it is really good and and one thing that's good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice oh but neither of my kids will eat it you know so then they eat a pizza or yeah so it yeah it defeats the purpose yeah it really does one thing i've run across recently though a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them oh yeah yeah my husband makes those i'm not i don't eat enchiladas i i don't like enchiladas i don't like the texture i don't know i guess it's the texture or something i don't like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my family does does he ooh uh-huh yeah well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah yeah i don't know i it's i don't know what i don't know i i don't know what it is about the enchiladas i just and i'm the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother i'm the only one that doesn't eat it but my kids love it you know isn't that something yeah i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess that's one thing that i particularly like um but i think it's good for you know for for company too and i've made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time uh-huh when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebody's house or something else yeah yeah i've got a chicken casserole that's like that that that i've it it's nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then uh-huh yeah because i when i make this chicken casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze uh-huh so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know we're not going to eat what what does it have in it it's just you can use chicken or turkey because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey uh-huh sure uh-huh and it's rice and i i i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i don't i'm not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste yeah uh-huh sure sometimes those are the best ones and well yeah but it it's like it's just chicken it it's as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and celery and that's it and some hard boiled eggs yeah ooh that sounds good and that's it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings uh-huh oh yeah those are good aren't they uh-huh on top of it for the crunchy and that's it you know and it it it goes and it's filling because of the rice um that sounds good right so you cook the rice before you put it in yeah uh-huh yeah i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free yeah that cholesterol fat free yeah that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many uh-huh new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing uh-huh i know you know and now it's it's it's okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now i'm just putting more and more in i don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it yeah and it's only it used to be like a hundred hundred calories per tablespoon and now it's like twelve oh i just think that's the best thing to have happened i'm just so excited about that yeah i know anyway yeah we did the low-cal stuff well with my kids i don't they get enough sugar and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they don't need any added help yeah yes right so when we're here at home you know with sweets and stuff they they don't we don't really do that much i do a lot of fruits uh-huh instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have Kool-Aid milk or water normally now when they go to their grandmother's house uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh which is every weekend it's a it's a different it's a different story all around that's when they as our family would say a pig out huh uh-huh that's exactly what it is that's good oh one of my boys that that's twelve um is has high cholesterol oh really have you ever found out about your kids no not yet and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down huh it's i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol he's never eaten any eggs he's never had anything but skim milk and you know i've never bought butter and things like that but um yeah huh oh he just left for the doctor again and it's it's kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so we've really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh yeah the lower cholesterol foods and stuff so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think we've probably talked long enough and  hello hello my name is Nola i'm in Plano Texas hi Nola i'm Steve i'm in Dallas Texas not too far away no that's unusual seems like usually i've had some from Plano too oh yeah i think all mine have been East Coast people so far uh-huh okay um let's see so social changes social changes what's that mean uh sounds like not as recent social changes too like back to the sixties or fifties i guess yeah think we can handle that yeah i yeah i definitely i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there that's a okay uh shall i go ahead and push one yeah sure okay you want to go ahead and start uh i was hoping that you would but oh yeah social changes is that uh it seems to me that uh that involves a lot of different areas i think does uh yeah like a lot it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is even more true today so yeah there is a a big difference in the uh economic that um status of uh people although i think that has been true uh always um perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was yeah it's like people are starting to give up hope and they start out very poor let's see that's a bad tangent to get on what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties and the nineties no um i think uh my in my situation i have three children and we're uh home schooling so education you know things that relate to to education um are things that i think about a lot um i think that and i think that involves social changes a lot uh for instance i think the schools are having more and more problems because of uh things that are happening socially in the world around them and in in to because of their parents and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home rather more not than are and children being put in day care centers from very early and and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening such as the day care centers and things are having a big effect on the social changes because of the way children are being raised they're not learning the values they need to learn and they're not um yeah they don't have the self-esteem that they need to have and they don't have the um a solid family life that they need to have to confidently and deal with the things in the world and uh i think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang gang things that are happening and and um yeah it seems so that yeah that is a pretty big change it seems even not just single parent families but with no guidance but it seems like some of these even ladies that that'll work and have a baby and then you know after two or three months go back to work you know well that that i mean that's very young for a baby yeah yeah oh that's really sad i think that a lot of people and they think they have to but i i think that if they really tried they wouldn't have to and i i think that if they didn't that yeah yeah and and it became more of the standard not to that uh i don't know maybe companies would start paying men more so that their wives could stay home you know and have a more solid uh foundation for the kids yeah yeah i mean they're going to like you said i mean there yeah there's they might be saving money i mean even if they had to pay more now i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to force two people to work even though it's higher productivity is short-term that's right it's already it already costs society much more because of it you know it trying to do all these programs like Headstart and things like those you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them you know yeah um there's and i think uh a lot of it is selfishness people have become very selfish they don't want to stay home with the kids or something like that there are a lot of two parent yeah yeah um situations where the woman goes back to work because that's what she wants to do you know oh rather than she needs the money just she wants the stimulating environment rather than that she has to have the money particularly or maybe there's a small need for money so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself too huh is yeah is the thing how uh home study is that what you said home school is that uh is is it like uh a preschool level then or through grade school or you know home school yeah no we're i have uh one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler and one on the way oh is oh well you sound busy so you're teaching them completely huh yes yes and i think uh it's becoming uh more popular then it has been for a while i think home schooling's always been around but uh i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools um and a lot of it is discipline problems yeah a lot of it is and you can tell which kids have been in day care centers it it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things that um yeah they've been raised in a day care center yeah that's pretty sad because i mean i don't know something's got to change with the schools that's what it all boils down to in the end usually anyway when they're young well i think it's going to have to change in the homes before anything changes anywhere else the home is the base yeah it's the basic unit and that's the where it all starts and if we don't start making changes in the homes and maybe part of that is educating parents better yeah and educating uh you know changing people's expectations i know they do do some they do have some classes in um high schools and things for kids to uh give them an idea of what family life is like and the uh you know and uh that kind of thing but um  okay well what kind of pet do you have one very old fat cat Prissy and that's why Pat won't ever let me have a party at my house that's right i remembered that's right Prissy get's you in trouble because you can't have them there that's right she does shed a lot of fur and how many pets have you had she's we've had her for a long time we used to have a Spitz that kind of got deposited on us when a cousin was getting a divorce and we were supposed to keep her temporarily for about twelve years usually we've had dogs or cats yeah well you know we have a dog named Pumpkin so what we've had him yes a year and a half and uh it's okay i don't know i i i told my kids basically i would just not as i just soon not have a pet in the house but i give in yeah i'm reaching that point too yeah it's it's it's hard for me i like pets a lot but i just don't like them in the house um-hum so i wished you know i wish we lived in an area where we had a big backyard i'd have a dog you know i'd have it outside but um i um-hum well i'm thinking of a next time about going back to a dog though because the cats really do shed a lot you just never get rid of the cat hair do they and i know there are a lot of dogs that are pretty clean and don't shed so Emily wants a dog a lot of her friends have little house mops kind of like yours sure sure well it is easy and like Pumpkin is real easy i mean we don't even have to walk him much or anything he um-hum but do you have to let him outside for all his business and all yeah yeah yeah he goes out in the morning but see that's what would be hard for us since we're not there a lot yeah well unless you got a doggy door you know like my my aunt and uncle have a doggy door and their dog just goes in and out at will um-hum yeah so that that's nice i think Jay would go bananas over that though he he likes for our house to be as secure as possible all sealed up yeah i know that's that's the problem with it but um um-hum but basically dogs our dogs worked out has worked out well and i think it's nice for the children i it's not my most favorite thing in the world but um-hum that can be so therapeutic though when when i really want to just crawl into a shell i think uh wouldn't it be nice just to lay on the bed and pet the cat yeah right well they are loving i mean that's um-hum that's the thing uh you know my friend Barb i have a friend good friend who's just moved here and she's gotten two cats and honestly she is just crazy about those cats um-hum and she's single lives by herself and they totally have kept her company you know i mean it is just it's really meant a lot to her to have those cats yeah and i really i i don't think i'm prejudiced since i've had both but i think cats are more prone to really have personalities i mean they own you rather than the other way around um-hum um-hum um-hum and i really do believe that i get a kick out of seeing my seventy seven year old aunt with her animals and she had a cat get killed not too long ago and she said no more you know i just i can't go through that again and it wasn't three months before she had another one and just adapting to it just yeah like she always had yeah and it's really neat for people living alone like you say with your friend yeah it's really you know Barb said she wishes that she had done it years ago you know that she had um um-hum gotten an animal years ago because she's been single a long time and you know she says it just makes a world of difference to come home and have them in the house yeah growing up it was so funny because mother would always have a soft heart for strays and uh-huh we never back then you didn't spay and neuter your animals that much you just kind of put up with whatever happened and she could never get rid of them fast enough before the next litter came along it wasn't usual unusual for us to have six and seven cats and i remember my first camera experience as trying to put cats up on a porch and take pictures of them that were going to be award winning type photos they've always been a part of my life well i guess so you've had them so you had them just from early on then oh yeah we had a Cocker Spaniel growing up but but the cats were the things that i loved and especially with being around kittens and the babies and all now were they indoor cats or outdoor cats no no dad never never would have allowed that right so they always just kind of showed up and came and went and had babies and we played with them we we used them as dolls sometimes we'd dress them up and put them in carriages as much as they'd tolerate it uh-huh uh-huh so it was always fun uh-huh well now see we lived on a real busy intersection in Phoenix and we had a dog but he was killed we we couldn't it was it was not it just wasn't conducive to animals oh yeah that was traumatic wasn't it yeah yeah it was it was very traumatic my sister it was really upsetting to my little sister and and um so that it just we didn't have many pets growing up just because our house wasn't conducive to that um-hum yeah and uh it just wasn't safe we didn't have a fence and our dog just got killed we'd keep him chained up but he got out and you know sure enough was hit by a car so um-hum yeah that's exactly what happened with ours and my brother really took it hard because he was the one that had left the gate open so he blamed himself personally although you know there were so many things that could have been different but it was hard for him to cope with it being his fault oh yeah i bet so i do hate that i that's one reason i like cats and critters that can stay inside because you don't face that right it's it's hard right especially if you really do get attached to them i'm i'm already kind of preparing for Prissy dying because she's pretty old and fat and oh i just know it's going to come sooner or later so that's one reason i've been letting Emily talk about dogs because i think uh-huh we we say that's going to be the end but i think when it really comes to it we'll want another pet how old is Prissy she's at least thirteen or fourteen we don't know exactly because we got her as a young kitten or a you ng cat and didn't know that much about her she's a neat cat i mean she owns us all the way um um-hum um-hum but it does require a little bit of work and housecleaning well uh you know it does that's just it and right now it's i do well to just take care of my children yeah yeah you know without taking care of an animal too so um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive that's right that's right we just we just were on vacation and uh it was you know it was expensive plus i think you know for Pumpkin he didn't you know he didn't like it we were gone two weeks and that was hard on him to be boarded for two weeks yeah yeah um-hum where'd y'all go uh we can't talk about that can we we went to Gulf Gulf no i guess not it's not pet related Gulf Shores Alabama and New Orleans and so we had a really good time oh boy yeah oh how neat so but yeah Pumpkin was but the puppy survived yes he did i always wonder i think well now how much do they remember you know like and you know my aunt says that they do drug them i just went bananas when she told me that that was a fact that she had shopped kennels and vets and that they all very lightly sedate them so that they sleep a lot and that just gave me the creeps because i you know i hate to think they did that to anything or anybody oh huh but she said every vet's office and kennel if they would let it if they  okay well i guess i enjoy eating out um uh here and there or it's it's a good change and good change from cooking and eating at home and i guess i like a variety of a variety of restaurants uh-huh uh sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal and sometimes it's i enjoy going out having a formal meal yes and uh sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad uh-huh something you know do you usually go out uh with the children or without them well a variety i i like to go sometimes without them and sometimes i sometimes it's okay to take them along so sometimes i think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner or lunches so uh right yes it just you know it just varies we do a mix sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was just to you know have a moment of peace and quiet without little ones at the table yes yes so uh well i i guess i guess actually on those those times uh we even there are times i even say oh please don't sit us next to a table with other children no i this is our night out so but uh anyway where do you like to eat uh well uh we don't have any children so uh we tend to like to try all sorts of different things and uh we're very attracted to exotic food uh-huh and uh we like Indian food and Thai cuisine and uh sort of gourmet Mexican and uh things like that as well as Tex-Mex and Italian and uh Chinese and things and and things of that sort now yes of course we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers or something like that too right and uh we probably go out one to two times a week right and uh uh we're pretty much regulars at an Italian local Italian restaurant oh which one do you like Momo's oh okay well it's been a long time since we've been in there but uh but it's good there's an Italian restaurant over over by the mall over by uh Plano Parkway there past oh is it Campari's or something uh-huh i've heard about it i haven't been in there well it's good i haven't my husband had been in there several times and we went in there actually we went in there for lunch one day and uh their pastas were great uh-huh that's that's one of the things a good pasta means a lot to me i i like different kinds of food so when we go out i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu even if it's a Mexican restaurant like something other than uh you know the standard tacos enchiladas tamales and fajitas now you're brave yes yes and once in a while things backfire i mean we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food and things like that and i'm not fond of some of those things but we'll try we'll try anything just about Ethiopian we've had Ethiopian oh God right and uh not in Plano of course but we really we really do enjoy going out and uh and i'm pretty adventurous in cooking too which also occasionally backfires no i don't think so you know oh well even though traditional it can backfire yeah i think that we're supposed to say what will bring us back to a restaurant or or what attracts us to a restaurant how do you usually find a a new restaurant uh well my husband's kind of the ethnic he he's the ethnic fan so he's i don't know you know what we read we read the uh D magazine uh-huh so do we we we check that and uh the Friday section in the newspaper the pull out section there they often do ratings of restaurants so uh we've uh-huh right uh we've usually we often save those and adventured out on from there uh just for something that had a high rating uh-huh we have found uh a number of restaurants either through D and the Friday paper and sometimes the the Observer which my husband usually picks up okay and also through coupons when a new restaurant opens up they usually send out coupons and you know when they say you know buy one get one free that's that's right it's hard to resist so we'll go in and very often we'll find a place that we like and we'll stick with it once they give they they no longer give coupons we'll we'll uh we'll stay there oh good oh good but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons and the other half through the newspaper through the newspaper reviews oh oh yeah we i guess we we use the coupons too that's true that's true i mean it's wonderful particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that it's very expensive to go out to eat oh right right right so yeah that that is really one of our it's almost a hobby with us well i think that it's just that's exactly sometimes i think going out to eat it's it's sort of a recreation yeah so uh just a just a change of pace yes from uh eating at home so uh anyway i guess uh as far as as far as service when we go out gosh it's nice it's nice to have somebody come and wait the table and clear the table and uh uh-huh oh absolutely and do the dishes yeah and do the dishes and uh actually it's kind of nice to you know i always uh a waitress or waiter that waits the table it's nice that they're attentive but it's not nice when they're too attentive oh yes so uh we've had experience with that too so oh my my my sister who also lives here in Dallas uh tends to uh chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner which drives me absolutely batty oh yeah well how we it may may help their tip may not huh but what's your favorite restaurant gosh i guess just in Plano i Plano i like to go to Souper Salads uh-huh uh Chili's Chili's is always fine sure i guess if we go to Dallas into Dallas we like uh the Routh is it Routh Street Cafe you know we've never been there and that's supposed to be wonderful we well you would like it you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome um uh-huh it just we've we've taken people there several times and uh they have a good they have a good choice of of things that are very different sounding i guess it's whether you call it Southwestern but uh oh we had venison ooh venison chili one time which was absolutely wonderful and then i guess it must be seasonal and we've been back oh i guess it's in the winter season well they've never had it when we've been back so but uh well you ought to try that it's it's it's very good uh-huh i would probably like that one or two times in my life i've ever had venison i've love d it but you know just it's just not i don't know people who hunt so no uh God that's that's supposed to be a wonderful place well uh uh uh here in Plano well we tend to go to Momo's a lot fairly often and uh sometimes we'll go you know we we also go to Chili's and uh Colter's Bar B Q and and uh we go to little there is a little Thai place that's over on park that we go to my husband particularly likes that we go into Dallas a lot and because we're both were from the Richardson North Dallas area up until fairly recently and uh we'll go down to uh Blue Mesa Grill for Mexican food and oh that's good yes i've been there oh  okay um does is this something that concerns you well i think it does um especially because i just moved to Massachusetts and uh they're having real problems because they have so many uh police layoffs uh-huh and uh personally i don't live in a real bad section of town but uh just because of the general area i live in the insurance rates are real high on your car and there's a lot of crime within a few miles of me right how about you yeah well i live outside of Dallas and it's kind of in a little suburb so i feel pretty safe out here but i know the murder rate is going up every year yeah i uh in Dallas and that worries me yeah i recently moved here and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the in the worst areas of town and uh my husband was was what he his concerns were well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander just to be in that location and i thought how sad it was that just to be in a wrong location at the wrong time and and a lot of kids you know are caught that way yeah yeah there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects which is but uh-huh you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet yeah that exactly that's really sad i've so you know it must be frustrating exactly what happened down here frustrating for the parents who can't get out of a situation like that uh-huh it'd be so scary i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime and it doesn't seem like anything is working it really doesn't it's kind of scary i think that uh i think the laws have gotten so lenient you know the court systems are too lenient i think that's part of the problem but in in on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full we can't at least in this area you know they don't have any room to put anybody so a lot of people just get out you know back on the streets because there's no they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have yeah they do that here too but i say you know they commit crimes let them be overcrowded you know let them suffer a little bit uh-huh i know it they have all sorts of of rights that you know are questionable maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes yeah i think so i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible wherever they were going maybe they'd think twice about doing it that's true maybe the punishment should be more severe yeah it the other thing that worries about it is kids that are doing such bad crimes so young you know like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill i know it people they i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything but that worries me i wonder what the next generation will be like yeah exactly exactly exactly because they get involved in things so young that they don't really realize what they're involved in yeah and uh some people prey on that you know they'll take uh kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen yeah and uh get them involved in things because uh well i don't know i was watching on a movie on TV i don't know how true those can be but you know they one guy got all sorts of kids under eighteen to do it by telling them you know you won't have a record because you're under eighteen to steal cars and everything oh so i guess if they had more of a deterrent if they had more severe punishments it might be but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial yeah seems like if they had immediate more immediate uh consequences to their actions it would sink in faster i think it would concern me even more if i had children which i don't but if i had children i wouldn't know where to raise them to protect them really yeah yeah because it seems like now even in the country you hear about bad things happening so uh-huh it's true they uh and they they talk about too the gangs spreading you know like everybody thinks of them only in LA and New York but they spread out to cover more area and i don't know if if gangs occur much down in Texas do they yeah i think they have them in Dallas because i hear them talking about in the schools different things happening and they've had some drive-by shootings outside of the schools yeah the same in some of the areas around here but i've never had any personal you know i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it or seen anybody but uh me either that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group and i think that a lot of people that sort of control them control what they're doing are older you know business you know trying to control whatever you know yeah seemed like like in the fifties when gangs were big it was just to be part of the gang but now they're so much into selling drugs and weapons and all that uh-huh it seems scarier it's true and the weapons my God the weapons that people have are some people are more seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military i don't know where they get them really yeah those machine guns and all that yeah that's scary it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore uh-huh that's the other thing uh is it's hard to even i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be especially if you're an inner city you know you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on and you're putting your life on your on the line everyday yeah Dallas they were saying in Dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen but they keep losing them all the time and that uh you know eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because i they won't let them hire any new ones and they keep leaving uh yeah i just read an article yesterday um where this what used to be a nice town in this area they had a lot of budget cutbacks Massachusetts is broke right now and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy and they had to cut twenty guys from their forces and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well it's like huh yeah they figure what a heyday huh this is a depressing conversation though it really is well there's someone at the door so i guess i'll have to go see what my dog is barking about but it was nice talking to you okay i hope things look up well thanks same for you bye bye-bye  you ready okay what have you seen lately yeah well uh it's funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadn't seen anything since Dances With Wolves but today i went to see Regarding With Henry oh i'm dying to see that it was really good we uh Jeff Warner just got out of the hospital and uh Jeff and Deanna went and oh uh-huh another friend in the neighborhood and uh we all liked it we had uh both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and uh oh my goodness oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and we'll all go see Regarding Henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad yeah well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh oh and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so we uh i finally it's my first summer movie yeah oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on we're going to the movies and we won't well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months yeah and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see Soapdish oh was that good and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but that's what i was that's the other one that we went to that night oh was it and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love Billy Crystal and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff oh so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great oh well good i'm i'm glad to hear that because they oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with City Slick i mean with Soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was uh-huh well i don't i don't know if you got to see Weekend um At Bernie's that was out a couple of year's ago they had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist no how neat and i don't know who was here or whether Jay just called a friend and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in but we thought we'd try it you know free movie shoot yeah it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing Soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and it's just it's just goofy i mean it's oh yeah uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think yeah i think it is i think it is um because it's it's just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing yeah oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical well i'm glad you did that before your surgery oh me too because i don't even know if i could live through it now i mean i'm getting around real good and i'm just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after yeah yeah oh gosh uh but see i don't have permanent work i right now i'm working with a temporary agency and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because you can learn all the software for free oh and so i went up to do WordPerfect because that seems like that's what everybody wants and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that yeah and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and so i went to my doctor's last Thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh you're just healing really well i just can't get over this he says in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now i'm not going to say you're going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and uh you know he was teasing me and yeah he says yeah you'll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks you've only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy i'll do it you know but and i've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it yeah yeah and so i don't i'm real glad that we didn't go see those funny ones when i was when i'm still sort of on the sore side yeah but well what what's your next have you seen Robin Hood yet no that was one uh Jay got to see with a friend and so i i and to try and uh uh try and find time it's hard uh with Jim's schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and oh yeah um i'm holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know it's just perfect for our age group and because i think he he needs a comedy too um uh-huh uh and that's what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that uh we've we've got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful we're really enjoying it but some of the different things we're doing uh uh-huh there's just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically you know he knew he couldn't get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um yeah when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know aren't real big but the the fire scenes and the drafts you know that action part is fantastic uh-huh but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then you'd expect but he but he enjoyed it and so oh really well i went course i am a Kevin Costner fan supreme yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh uh-huh gosh was that wonderful in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didn't ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because we really wanted him to see it too oh yeah uh i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see i do too i think he's really good and he's very good in Regarding Henry that's not an easy part to play i i don't think i wouldn't think well my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that yeah that's at that one won't your sides um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians good i have my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age and we went to the uh-huh  okay hi Nancy well do you do a lot of dining out no um we don't although we enjoy it um we do it more when we have company come um what about you uh-huh well we do some some dining out um i i do a lot of cooking so um mostly like when we go out you know it's my husband and i i we don't go out too often as a family um unless it's like a fast food kind of thing but um but we do enjoy dining out one of our favorite places here in in the Dallas area is Atlantic Cafe i don't know if you have you ever been there i've heard of that but i haven't been there um where about is that um well actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific and uh oh okay i i've been to Cafe Pacific have you the now that's down in uh Highland Park it's Highland Park Village did you like it right yes um oh i love it before before we moved to the area my brother uh lived in Dallas for a number of years and we came up one time when my father was visiting and we all ate there and oh their seafood was wonderful uh-huh oh it is it's fabulous it really is good now where is the Atlantic Cafe Atlantic Cafe is down on i believe it's on McKinney oh okay um and originally originally the two the the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and the the guy who owns the Atlantic Cafe were partners in the Atlantic Cafe and then they they separated and the guy started Cafe Pacific and i loved them both i really do i think they're wonderful that's our favorite you know what we'd really like if if we just have a a casual evening is Houston's have you been there no um but i've heard that's really good too and it's wonderful the only thing is you have to wait you have you have to expect to wait at least an hour so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in and oh as long as you know that it's okay but they have i think one just about the best prime rib oh um anywhere in the area i love it oh okay but uh-huh and my husband really likes their ribs so it's hysterical we go in and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in and then we get there and we don't even look at the menu i know right away what we what we want yeah yeah you know right away what you want well we really enjoy prime rib too and uh actually the the Steak And Ale out here um we've gone to uh my in-laws also enjoy prime rib when they've had some of their specials on Sunday Monday or Tuesday night and uh the time we went the prime rib was really good uh-huh uh-huh was it really i've never i've i've been there for like you know lunch but i've never been there for dinner and it was good yeah uh-huh yeah yeah oh that's great that's great another nice place for for prime rib is Baby Doe's oh i've heard about that too but no we've uh i guess we eat out even less than i realize Maxwell's nice have you been there oh and i didn't think we ate out very often Baby Doe's is nice and one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to oh uh is Lawry's i've heard that's real good Lawry's Prime Ribs yeah yes i'd i had heard that too um i've i've never been there but i've heard it's real good have you been to the little uh not for prime rib but the Cafe De France um right here on Central Expressway yes yes actually they have one in Richardson that i've been to uh they have real nice lunches have you have you been there for lunch or yeah oh okay yes uh primarily lunch well and breakfast sometimes but uh during the week they often have a a limited menu choice but uh very reasonable complete dinners for six ninety nine that included the soup and or salad really really entrees and accompaniments and dessert and uh the my husband and i like veal uh a lot and their veal dishes have been good we've tried uh-huh different ones when they've had them as one of the the specials um-hum have you ever been to Biffin's i keep hearing about it i keep hearing the advertisements of it and and they keep saying you know oh it's wonderful it's wonderful i have not been over there and i was thinking you know it's supposed to be a family place i yes no over near Plano Super Bowl and uh i've i've not been there right and i haven't either uh one place and i've only been there for lunch but um i went with a friend and we met her husband um down on Greenville down near the Highway Twelve area is Gershwin's i've been there oh i we just we it was and we had the uh we both enjoy mushroom soup and Linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup and they did it was wonderful but um that was nice and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert uh which was a chocolate sack i don't know if you tried but or something oh i've heard of it where where it's made it's like it's like a it's all chocolate like made like a paper bag and it's filled with what whip cream and and strawberries and something yes it yes it had a sponge cake and whip cream and it had strawberries kiwis and raspberries in a raspberry yeah oh uh puree and we shared one the three of us and it was plenty because it was very rich but uh i wished i'd had a camera it was beautiful oh oh oh i bet it was i bet it was uh the last time we went to Cafe Pacific it was Father's Day and we took another friend with us and oh uh for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves and so we had they had uh like a berry assortment it was it was raspberries and blueberries and and strawberries on a plate with like a custard on the bottom oh and you know they they did like the raspberry puree just kind of like in a in a decoration on the you know how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then piled the berries and shaved chocolate on top of it and it was outstanding it was really really relatively simple but oh it was good it was really good yes yeah oh it sounds wonderful well that's uh one of the things the that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant uh i love fresh berries and their uh their fruits are always exceptional i don't i'm know they must have a special source for getting them because even at the Farmer's Market uh you can't find them like that and you can't find them yeah yeah yeah yeah you know i i'm originally from Connecticut and uh i was home a few years ago and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner and i was really amazed you know the the restaurants up there were kind of quaint you know they were real real pretty but they lacked the service and they lacked the atmosphere the just the i don't know the restaurants down here seem like they have uh i guess there's so much competition that they really have to be good uh-huh and i thought i would really miss that i would too because well i guess because we don't go out very often when we do go out um in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess and uh it is it's a whole experience of course you want the fo od to be good but the atmosphere and service i think are important uh too uh-huh and you know in order to survive in this area i think they have to be good because the ones that aren't so good don't just don't make it yeah um that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track but it is wonderful it's called Cafe Max and it's at Plano Road and Campbell they have the most wonderful salads they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three ooh really  well and well let's see we're going to talk about uh kids in college and how to help them kids how to pick one right yes well it and you've been through three of those uh three times yeah yeah well i've been through once so well if how did you do it with your three well with uh John the first one he wanted to go into engineering so uh he had never really lived in a large town so we looked at good engineering schools in relatively small towns like Purdue in uh Lafayette Indiana we looked at uh Clemson and VPI where were you living back then we were living in in north Alabama at the time okay and uh we looked at Mississippi State which was in a small town in Mississippi and uh finally settled on Auburn which was in Alabama in the small town of Auburn uh-huh and uh we also wanted a school that had a uh coop program because uh he wanted to go into engineering and we thought that a coop program was a good way to get some experience at the same time uh-huh so that was kind of how uh we finally settled on small town and good engineering school with a coop program for him for Brian yeah it that was kind of funny because he first started out thinking uh that he wanted to go to a small school that's what he thought when we lived in Alabama and then he moved to Plano and went to Senior High uh-huh he figured if i can go to Senior High i can go to school any place yeah i i think there's a lot of that when you go to a school with two thousand kids there that's right suddenly a college that's small seems i'm going backwards yeah so he ended up so uh i don't remember what his original major was because he changed it about three times at A&M but he ended up going to A&M i think because of yeah uh he just thoroughly enjoyed the uh the atmosphere down there when he went down for a trip uh-huh and uh he was sold on the place Jana i think wanted to to stick a little closer to home and really didn't have a major when she went in in fact i think that was somewhat of a a default because her grades were not as good as uh Brian and John's in high school so she was somewhat limited in her in her choices to places like Stephen F and uh-huh North Texas and maybe UTA and uh uh-huh she had some idea that she might want to uh do something with uh physical therapy and TWU was also up in uh in Denton so if she started at one she could move to the other and might not even have to move out of her apartment uh-huh yeah so it was kind of close to home and there were two schools in town that uh she could commute back and forth between the two uh-huh how did uh your gal picked Baylor well i think it was well a little bit of she narrowed it pretty rapidly to eliminate the real big ones Texas and A&M yeah and then it kind of got to be a combination of what she thought she wanted to do and uh the uh quality of the program it it you know Baylor was kind of always at the lead there for uh for some time uh she looked at Austin College i think she applied at Trinity but she really wasn't applying at any of the state schools oh what's her major um accounting uh-huh so it was a bit of of the major but not a whole lot there's a lot of campuses have business majors so that was not a big deal for her sure but she just uh it was sort of her choice and i think it was a little bit of we visited there and she visited some because her high school boyfriend's sister was there so she had spent some time there and i see felt pretty comfortable she she looked at Austin College but i think again it was the the size aspect it was just too small for somebody coming from Plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller good one in Plano yeah yeah what is the population of Baylor i don't even know so its uh about uh eleven thousand oh is it okay yeah so it's uh it's sizeable but it's it's sort of in the not giant size yeah yeah not like uh Austin and College Station yeah yeah in the case of your kids that i i guess with Jennifer it was more uh that she was making her own choice which i kind of feel is one of the keys if they're going to go do it they better they better decide where with uh yeah it needs to be a place they want to go yeah uh if they're going to be successful if they think Mom and Dad picked it or they're going there because that's where Mom and Dad went and that's what they want them to do uh that's the wrong reason for picking a place yeah that's kind of the way Brian picked his first major i think he without asking me he thought because i was in computer science that he should do the same thing and so he started out in that arena and didn't really care for it and finally asked if i would mind if he changed and i said uh-huh not at all because you you want to find something that you like to do not necessarily what your Dad does yeah so uh definitely he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did yeah well it seems uh i don't know of a whole bunch of kids who uh really do what their father did there's some i think doctors may be a place where and i don't know quite why that sons often follow Dad uh-huh into the profession and maybe that's some of it takes Dad's pull to get an in and other folks can't get in as easily well that could be but uh i don't have any kids who want to become engineers uh so uh you just kind of live with it sure well and they they need to do something that they think they will enjoy yeah and uh uh like i told Jana once she finally settled on a major she just did so much better in college than she did in high school once she found something to get excited about uh-huh yeah and uh whether she ever makes a lot of money at it or not is is immaterial if she enjoys it and is good at it and uh so far i think she is yeah well that's the key to it is that enjoying what you're doing and uh you know i think the folks i see having more trouble picking colleges are i got some friends who at Arco there who uh well they're from back east and uh and uh their kids are are looking in on some of those eastern private schools uh-huh when you start looking at the twenty to thirty thousand dollar price tag and you oh i know it start saying well do you really have to go there to get what you want that's right i mean it would be nice if you could but you you can be successful without necessarily having a uh a degree from an Eastern school uh-huh but they're from back east and they got a lot of relatives there so it's uh some of them do that uh-huh well they feel some uh some peer pressure from their peers the parents do sometimes yeah yeah  okay um where do you live in Plano in Plano yes where do you live in Dallas oh okay uh the air pollution isn't too bad in our area so we're very fortunate but huh i know in some areas it's really it it really is bad um i was trying to think uh something we were watching the other day and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that uh i've never been out there but i haven't either it was it was quite evident that uh-huh it was a real brown area and well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh yeah where they are burning a lot of coal and oil up more up north i guess uh i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the yes yeah air isn't as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area yes well i know uh that's been the concern in Europe they hadn't uh we have friends in Germany and uh have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we switched uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars uh that's something that Europe didn't do right away and now they're doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country that's the only pollution that's been there it's not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of from acid rain um i guess from from something that the car was um was giving i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid yes and it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like you've seen what it's done to buildings even where it's really bad yes yeah what's interesting several years ago i took a course uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was and there wasn't from various kinds of of energy and uh at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of pooh-poohed you know oh you're making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing and it's turned out that that's been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage so it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh i'm not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use is not bomb quality and we're so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesn't pollute the air at all it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants it's kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear yes so i don't know in Europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become uh bomb quality but that's the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned where it could eventually perhaps there's some problem uh pollute the groundwater so i don't know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh fusion or something clean well we've got a problem on the line don't we yes yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i don't know why uh-huh but uh solar of course would be the clean cleanest well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal i can't hear you at all for all this static oh i don't know what to usually it's the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me now i can again okay i don't know what uh i i don't know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh uh-huh there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still uh-huh working on but oh yeah it it's still got a long way to go what it's just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe they'll come up with fusion yes you know control be able to control it i don't know how long that'll take but one of these days because that's perfectly clean yes it's just we can't control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isn't not at all and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so that's not going to work at least not now but uh who knows what the future will hold uh as far as energy goes i i think with solving some of the energy future energy problems we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well uh i hope so i do to i like to be optimistic i don't like to be pessimistic about these things well i do think um i mean you've already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there's a problem and more people are interested in uh we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it yes yes well and and for the future generations too uh uh-huh i've noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth yes and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns we'll solve a lot of our problems i'm afraid i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't so many of them didn't people didn't care you know it's whatever you know recycle well if it's a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away yeah how horrible you know now i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes uh and create yeah  okay start us okay all right well i guess you know i i wasn't expecting that question about AIDS so i haven't thought too much about it but i guess i think that we should have more research um i'm just concerned that it's just going to be such a major health problem yeah and if we you know and if it's not i say it would seem to me the sooner we take care of it the better off we're going to be right because it's just getting worse and worse and worse and worse well that's what i think and it's going to start affecting all of the population you know i mean right now yeah you know and it's just going to become such a huge issue yeah yeah it already has and it's just so scary that there's just not much that can be done at this point so i guess right although they are doing a whole more than they were five years ago you know they're living longer and and their medicines are a whole lot better so they're not having to go through as many of the as of the other diseases yes or so it sounds anyway as you know when when all of this first started out they they came down with every single disease that came down the pipe because they had no immune system and they suffered so much worse yeah yeah right yeah so you know at at least they're making progress but they've got to get it stopped they've got to find a cure well well i think so too and so i guess i would you know personally i would be really in favor of that now i have had um i have two friends who've died of it so have i and uh so and those have just you know it's just been real hard and i just hate seeing people you know go through this yeah so and i keep thinking it's going to hit our church eventually you know it's like uh it's it's real interesting to me that we've not had anybody yet but you know it's going to just start affecting i think everyone well yeah well especially with you know surgeries all the time i know it's so scary it is really scary you know i i thought of that for myself for like for my children this whole issue of the whole blood issue is very scary uh-huh right because you know people don't know that's the thing there's a factor there's a time factor in there right yeah and you know well with the time factor it could be up to ten years i know you know so that's what's so bad and and you may test negative this time but you may test positive you know two weeks down the road i know so the test is relevant for that very day but not necessarily forever well that's right and i think you know people give blood innocently enough assuming that they're okay i don't suppose anybody would give blood if they felt they i don't know i guess they might but yeah yeah uh you know i i would hate to be in a position where i would need a transfusion or my children i think it would be a real scary thing yeah and and like when i went in the hospital you have to sign a paper saying that that you'll allow them to give blood if they if you need it otherwise they won't do the surgery oh so what do you do i mean yeah you're given the option of signing or not signing but if you say no i don't want the blood then they they may say well then i'm not going to do the surgery yeah really there yeah right well because yeah then what are they going to do right right what what can they do um they have no other alternatives i suppose um well i i don't know i mean i just but then i think well uh yeah i guess that basically i do think we just need more research because that's going to sort of be the our only answer well yeah that's right and they've got to do something about it they can't put it on the back burner and just say well you know the research is going on is doing good enough because it's not there's no cure yet well and i worry you know the older my children get the more exposure chances of exposure they're going to have i mean i can't imagine well even for you being a single person i mean i think gosh how scary you know to meet people and you got it yeah uh you you know of course i don't have that problem i probably will never have to worry about that oh oh gosh what a shame uh well you might you know eventually slight chance you think yeah that might eventually happen but uh uh that's oh it it is it's like okay show me your papers i mean i mean really then we'll talk i know well it's just a it's just a sad thing and i don't know hopefully this is going to get taken care of at some point yeah well they're doing a lot over in Europe yeah with it and i know when Randy was so sick he was having medications flown in from Europe because he couldn't get his hands on it over here and uh oh this was your husband wasn't it that's right i've forgotten that you told me that but i'd forgotten uh-huh yeah so he was he had a lot of medication coming in from Europe uh-huh and then he finally was able to get the what is it AZT over here only because he had connections that was not open to the public at that time AZT hum so i don't know but they've got to do it because it's it's everywhere well i know and and you know and make it available to people that that can use it i you know if i were sick i would try anything i think i mean what do you have to lose to everybody yes of course i mean that's what's that's what's so crazy i mean what's to lose at this point that's right there's nothing to lose so you may as well do whatever you got to do i would if it were me yeah or if it was one of my kids yeah i mean yeah you'd want you'd want everything available and then to think well it's available but you could i mean you know you could only get it in Europe um right no problem would would be a terrible yeah that would be a terrible thing yeah but um how long was he how long was Randy sick a little over two years hum a little over two years and at that point he was the fifth fifth longest survivor but see that was almost four years ago yeah and now they're living a whole lot longer so but he i mean jeez he had everything under the sun he had hepatitis he had meningitis he got throat cancer hm and he never smoked even a grapevine much less a cigarette you know um just you name it he he just oh it was horrible it was horrible so he was really susceptible that's awful yeah and then i had another very dear friend of mine die four months after Randy did huh and uh he didn't know he was sick he'd just you know had a cold that he couldn't shake all winter um-hum and kept getting sicker and sicker and finally went in the hospital and uh had pneumonia and both lungs were full and he died within about sixteen hours of going to the hospital um um well in some ways that's a blessing yeah i mean it's such a awful thing to suffer through yeah yeah and his friend had died the year before well my huh and they swore it wasn't AIDS but i know darn good and well it was yeah yeah you know so ooh it's just that that's close to home well i know it is well my two friends both one one lived a fairly long time with it i'd say Ken had it well he thinks he had he was HIV for ten years you know i mean he no he thinks he had it even back in the early eighties um you're kidding um my gosh and then he died in eighty nine uh-huh so and then Terry  well how do you feel about spot testing spot testing for drugs well basically i think it would be a good idea myself i uh i think if somebody's not on drugs they have no reason you know to be afraid of it uh i do think that there has to be some controls uh like i don't think one test positive should um-hum uh be uh the end of it you know i i think they should test more than once right yeah it's it's refreshing to hear somebody that has a similar opinion as mine i mean all these people that are against it that may they yeah they may not even be on drugs yet they they call it an invasion of privacy it um-hum and i don't see you know that to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for that's right and they i believe that they have the right to know if you're using a a dangerous substance um-hum um-hum there's so many jobs that uh really have other people's lives in their hands or even their own life and you know and it's uh but um-hum uh how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it right you know and i just um i i think there definitely needs to be some control to it i guess it is possible to have a false positive report yeah no i i i agree that you know you there there needs to be a a well thought out sane approach to how to administer that program just because you know you you something can get mixed in the mail or um-hum um-hum uh the chemicals could react incorrectly than than what you would expect them to and yeah you or somebody's test get mixed up with somebody else's i mean those things do happen right yeah uh i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined uh wrongly right and you know i've the the the company that i work for uh has just recently well you know within the last couple of years instituted for all new hired employees they submit to a uh urine test uh-huh and they they say that there've been you know they they they've also implemented random testing uh-huh and it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that you know it's been in progress but uh i i fully agree with it and there's you know there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy and uh-huh um-hum i i agree with you if if if you feel it's an invasion of privacy you've you've probably got something you're trying to hide yeah and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do that uh doesn't require the testing yeah right uh to me it's to me it's not an invasion of privacy i think it's people have a right to know if if uh their their life maybe is in jeopardy or uh or the quality of their products yeah their work the work they're doing for their company uh those things are all affected if not immediately it certainly does eventually yeah i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first it doesn't seem to uh bother the quality of work um-hum but eventually it does right because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing to get the same effect um-hum um-hum um-hum hum course i feel the same way on the AIDS problem i i don't think that's an invasion of privacy that's the only communicable disease that they're not allowed to test for you know and it's destroying a lot of people's lives and then and one of the few that they don't have a cure for yeah and it's you know it's it's destroying people's lives and i i think that person plus anybody in danger should should be know about it and be aware of it yeah so i don't know it's it's kind of hard to i guess the the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that that uh an invasion of privacy of course that's not supposed to be what we're talking about today i guess so yeah i kind of get off on a tangent here uh do you work for uh Texas Instruments uh-huh yes i do and i'm i'm down in the the central but i don't know how familiar you are with Texas but i'm in a we live in a town uh near a town called Temple which is right in between Waco and Austin on the freeway um oh that's probably way my brother did live in Grapevine Texas that's near Dallas right we're yeah we're probably about two two and a half hours south of him uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh so it's pretty hot down there probably oh my it's actually we got about two inches of rain in about three hours yesterday and it's cooled things down somewhat it's getting more humid now but yeah oh did you really oh that's great uh-huh we we need rain real bad up here it's uh everything's really getting dry it's uh um it's been about three weeks since we had any yeah it's kind of at a dangerous level here people hauling water and uh it's getting real bad hum wow so so how about that well i hope you do get some rain up there um so do i uh i can't think of anything else uh but yeah i i i guess being in agreement kind of tends to limit the conversation you know uh-huh uh-huh uh i can understand i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them i can see them objecting you know there's a lot of people that think there's nothing wrong with one of the things i found interesting it it's funny that you mentioned that TI is pretty much a worldwide company and we have manufacturing plants all around the world um-hum um-hum including some places where the use of certain drugs that are illegal here are not illegal um um-hum um-hum and the policy doesn't apply to those folks um is that right yeah they don't have to submit to drug testing like like they do here in the States and some places abroad oh i'll be darn yeah i thought that was kind of interesting too yeah yeah the different cultures and that too uh yeah i mean uh uh from from a quality standpoint that's not i mean just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way i i can't think that would make any differen ce whether it was legal or not it it would have to affect you the same way yeah right yeah but like if you're going to do business in another country you've got to respect their rules i mean if if you know that's that's the trade off i guess um-hum oh yeah you can't you go by their laws yeah the same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there that's why a lot get in trouble hum because they have to follow their rules and uh some of the countries are very much against drugs and right you use them you pay for it usually with your life in some places you know yeah yeah a lot of them yeah where where is it they lose a that's right if they steal they lose a thumb or a finger is that where it is i thought wow you know that's quite a deterrent yeah from the Middle East yeah Iraq Iran in that area yeah well in in Saudi Arabia you know using uh alcohol and drugs and stuff like that you get the death penalty yeah yeah so it's pretty strict over there yeah so i guess you know we really we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how great our country is well people tend to take the first amendment out of context which which means you know i could do anything i want to and you can't stop me and you know um-hum um-hum they they abuse it is what they do yeah yeah yeah yeah so that's so i don't know i'm i'm i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy um  well my favorite type of music is classical music and uh i i enjoy orchestral classical music and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano you know and that's those are my that's my favorite type uh probably the favorite instrument would be uh the violin well oh well my favorite well i i don't really have a favorite i i like everything basically um i guess if i had to pick it would be like like pop i would think but i like everything so it's kind of hard to choose sometimes yeah you know i guess i enjoy i enjoy jazz listening to jazz sometime although i don't feel like i have a good good good understanding of it or a good a good good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not but but um i enjoy it and uh sometimes i enjoy listening to uh fiddle music we were in Colorado recently and heard this um-hum these uh well we heard this fiddler and we bought his we bought his tape and it's kind of fun to listen to the fiddle pans yeah so i grew up next door to uh the Richardson Symphony Orchestra leader so oh Chris Xeros oh you lucky thing yeah so we used to go and listen to them all the time and my parents still do yeah so i grew up with a lot of his music and and what not plus my parents are well especially my dad likes a lot of classical music and he introduced my brother and i both to a lot of it so oh gosh Chris Xeros you grew up with his children too then yeah oh gosh yeah sure did gosh small world huh yeah we all went to high school together and we're still in contact with each other we all go back to parents' houses on the weekends and what not so oh oh gosh well actually i used to play in the Richardson Symphony i played violin in the orchestra for several years oh really you know yeah so it is a small world isn't it yeah small world so i you know i know Chris yeah he a pretty nice guy most of the time yeah well i never i had to work for him and i never would want to work for him so no no well life just took different turns here so uh it just doesn't work out to do that now so he's he's about ready to retire another year and he yeah yeah he sure is he just became a grandfather yeah i heard that it's it's daughter it's his daughter that uh uh-huh yeah they just had the baby's christening so oh it was really nice so was it a boy or a girl he's a little boy yeah what did they name him i can't it it's a oh gosh it's like Elijah or something like that oh i keep forgetting what what she named him oh his middle name is Chris or Christopher for for her daddy but i think it's Elijah of course oh yeah yeah it starts with an E i can't remember oh so you've heard the Richardson Symphony yeah yes yeah we've heard them and liked liked it real well of course yeah do you have a favorite instrument um actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord yes i really like those in fact i had a harpsichord played at my wedding oh did you yeah oh which was real nice i got married uh during the Christmas season and we we played uh old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not and it was real nice i liked that a lot oh i liked the sound of the harpsichord and it played by itself no somebody played it well i mean but you didn't have oboe or something with it no no no no no just by itself just by itself oh yeah oh well that's really yeah that's i bet that was nice it was real nice yeah it went well it was a change you know from your traditional normal normal normal you know stuff and since it was Christmas time and and uh we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias and you know stuff like that and oh so we did the harpsichord with old time traditional Christmas carols not not you know the bouncy you know sing along kind but right right some of the old older ones that some i don't even i recognize the the melodies and whatnot but i didn't recognize the names right right so it was real nice well actually i play i play the violin in in a string quartet that often plays at weddings um so um i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano uh-huh and it makes it makes it nice it makes you know you can say classy or it makes an elegant wedding to have something else it does it really really does and it it has such a different sound to it anyway it's almost i don't know the way it vibrates it's kind of haunting you know on on some of the notes it it's i'd i like it oh i don't know how else to explain but we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas they're uh called Odessa it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years and we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff too so we've had a lot of stuff you know friends and and things to do with music that constant and plus my husband's real big into music too so he doesn't play anything but yeah he just likes to listen and my dad and my kids are now well my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast and oh now does does the school in in your in your city does it does it offer like band or some of the instruments yeah well my my oldest is only nine so he he hasn't really gotten into um that yet they have choir that they go to you know music class that they go to but um okay right he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet right uh right so i think that starts in sixth grade probably oh gosh so but i don't know he he shows he the only thing he's really shown interest in wanting to play is the drums cause his my my brother plays and um i i don't i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not you know it's just one of those things i'm just going to wait and see if he's interested in something you know yeah right right you got a little ways to go too right yeah just a little bit great wow well my my oldest is eight and and she's we've started her on piano so uh uh but that's been it's been fun i mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared but it's been fun it's it's been fun i feel like i've learned a lot about the piano i've learned a lot about playing the piano really and uh it kind of makes me listen a little closer to to the piano when i hear it at other places or when i you know see some see and hear someone playing i sort of watch their technique too and and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning yeah so it's been fun so i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it or  all right um how do you feel about the health insurance problems well uh i agree that they have problems but i i'm afraid i'm very much against universal health um my daughter is uh uh stationed in England right now and of course you know they've had uh group health uh over there for some time um uh-huh yeah i was over there last uh a year ago when my granddaughter was born and uh she had some problems and uh i was horrified from beginning to end first of all they are about fifty years behind uh-huh they don't have and their medical technology he doctors since they aren't responsible really to each patient don't feel they have to sit down and talk to you about the problems um-hum when they want to do something to a patient whether the patient is a few days old or eighty or ninety they do it they don't ask permission wow my daughter went um upstairs into intensive care to see the baby and they were doing surgery on the baby and she didn't even know they were going to surgery on the baby uh oh my God what a terrible thing for her to go through yes it was it was really terrible that's why i went over there i mean she was she cried she called and was you know really you know upset um the day we were leaving the hospital finally um we were getting all ready to go home and finally you know the baby was okay and everything was fine and the doctor that had been working with her poked his head in the door and he said by the way he said in six weeks he want you to come back uh for a test uh uh a test that we want to do on on her um for uh uh multiple sclerosis ah and he turned around and left and we just kind of looked at each other and said what uh for what and i i tried for fifteen minutes to find the doctor and he was unavailable so uh i've had some bad experiences with it i i uh perhaps not you know uh i don't know a good solution do you have any ideas yeah well no i i i had never had experiences like you did which sound terrible to go through well the the thing is these are the HMO's that they have now which are cheaper and you can in my daughter my other daughter belongs to an HMO or they used to thankfully they've just changed um you don't um-hum uh-huh you only get a choice of doctors that are in your area not necessarily of doctors that are good or not uh see i i've worked for i worked for John Hopkins for two years right right uh-huh uh at the hospital there and i've worked for a private doctor for two years and um i got to slap in the face as far as the medical profession was concerned in the United States uh now the doctor that i worked for was good but there was another one in our complex that uh she didn't feel should even be practicing medicine and i said well why don't they get him out of there she said well he hasn't done anything wrong it's just that he has poor judgment and i thought oh gosh i mean you're the doctor telling you this you know oh some horror stories like that but then with the HMO um the they sent here to a pediatrician that had one gentleman that was uh uh in his late seventies and an Indian doctor that she couldn't understand and that had no patience with children ah and you know it was kind of that was kind of a bad experience too so when they changed she finally got you know a good pediatrician but uh uh it it it's it's just a little scary when you don't have as much when you can't just go say here's a good doctor i'm going to go to this doctor you know um right and i i fear that the doctors are going to not be as you know right now they're in a lot of fierce competition so they they keep up to date you know at least most of them the good ones um i i i don't know i just fear that uh that it may go downhill if we do indeed you know change to something like that uh that doesn't give any incentive no it doesn't uh also uh we uh my husband was a civilian but we were uh stationed overseas for a while and so i had to go to myself and the children had to go do military doctors huh wow now that's another story you know so but it's the same same thing i mean these doctors didn't want to be here okay they were forfilling fulfilling their military obligations and you know they uh of course i guess if you a doctor gets into the field you know they uh well enjoy the field but um the i have found uh through people that i know that have HMO's that most of the doctors that they see there may be one or two good ones and the rest of them are either foreign speaking i mean not speaking but like Indian doctors you can't understand them because of their their um uh accent uh-huh uh or uh Chinese or and i have nothing against them in fact i went to a doctor for years that was a Chinese doctor but i could understand what he was saying um-hum you know so i just it just this is a bad subject for me to be on only because i've had some real bad experiences and i've known some people that have uh yeah i guess so i just joined an HMO i just got a new job and i haven't heard i haven't been i haven't even actually paid for it or actually started my coverage yet but that's what they have is HMO and been right well i'll tell you now what you do is you go uh to the doctors and just meet them um-hum and get feel on you know you can usually tell if you go to a doctor and if you you give him i don't know some ache or pain or just how they you know reply um if they're going to be good or not the doctor that will sit down and talk to you and that will you know do things like that uh is uh uh is usually pretty good but uh uh you know you i'll try him out well what they told me at at work they told me that uh they said that the most once you get to know the doctors well you get you get your choice of doctors but there's huge waiting lines for the good ones and there's no waiting lines for the bad ones so you don't really get the good ones even if you choose them you don't get them for years and years if at all yeah ow it should okay see that's it so yeah so that's see that's what scares me about going into universal health yeah okay i mean you could you could really be in serious trouble if you wait to see one of the ones that you feel are better if uh uh you know if we went to that and that was all there was uh um uh how would they decide who get's which doctor oh well they don't it would it would still be like it is now um the ones in your area oh i see local you know and that would be closest to where you live uh and you know those are the ones that you would see i mean i would presume um but uh but also now in England how they work it is you go to see a regular MD if he determines that it's necessary then he'll send you to a gynecologist or a surgeon or you know you can't just go there right that the same for the HMO and and because the doctors work for the HMO the people i work with are telling me you know HMO's are great if you're generally healthy uh and you just go for the checkup every year or whatever it's just three dollars but if you have a problem then it's real hard to get the doctor to refer you to a specialist because they're told you know not to because it cost the HMO money yes um-hum yep um hum that's right and uh i mean you know that could potentially be um rather  okay well let's see well we keep our paper paper bags lined up in the garage for glass and glass and uh plastics and uh we make the dump over to the Wal-Mart bins there as soon as they're full i guess we collect milk milk cartons and whatever plastics other plastics are acceptable are are you in the part of town where uh they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling no no i didn't think that anybody had those at all yet well maybe they don't i i know that was supposed to be in May and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were right well no i haven't seen any so i i thought that it all had all been delayed several times so i have no idea what they look like and i'm yeah the kind of anxious to see them that's going to be interesting because it's uh we've gotten so convenient and conventional in trash disposal which is uh i look at our big green containers and i say well they work fine and i keep mine outside the garage so that i don't have any odors but it's clearly a place where uh oh right uh it'll be interesting to see how well that works and i am i'm glad the community is doing it uh it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people uh i don't know if where you grew up in your what you saw back uh years ago but for me the thing that strikes me is i uh growing up in rural South Dakota where hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery right would candle them and package them is that uh in the fifties uh you could say we had the recycling going on then that we should have now right which was all the milk bottles were glass and you got a nickel or dime which in that time was a lot of money when you returned them pop bottles all had a deposit on them oh oh of course that they did you know actually we had milk delivered to our house oh in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house uh-huh you could just leave the milkman a note on what you needed and so you just put the empty ones back out there and he took them away and put you know put another gallon of glass glass bottle in there so uh yeah yeah yeah so uh you know i look back at at uh my childhood and i'd say you know they were doing things then that we should be doing now and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're we're uh kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this uh throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies right right it would be nice it would be nice to see it take a good turn here it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away so i hope that this time it it it stays i mean it's just yeah to see stacks and stacks of newspapers just to the trash is just amazing so uh you know we when we go dump actually when we go dump our things oh we collect newspapers too and then take them seems like there's a pretty well there's a pretty pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics uh-huh so that's kind of encouraging i didn't know you know i i didn't know if we started to do that i didn't know what to expect yeah well i'll have to say i'm i'm the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper uh taking that to the Boy Scouts and my aluminum cans right uh getting rid of those but on the plastic i have uh i don't have any habits there yet and i'm guess i'm waiting for the city to to push me in that direction but well i guess they will shortly i guess but it just seems like on the larger scale that you know the we always talk about in our society is that economic strife things and i think if uh if we just start to put you know the nickel deposit on things like uh was the case years ago that uh it would have more immediate effect uh than because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window and so oh right outside my little town we would uh go out and look for long neck beer bottle because they were worth something yeah right do you know i saw in Tom Thumb yesterday i saw the return to the uh the small Coke bottles yeah and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not i well that's interesting because they're back to glass you're saying they were glass they were the glass uh well let's see they'd be i don't know maybe ten ounce or uh-huh six ounce or ten ounce yeah sort of a small size sort of a small size and and we anyway we just we didn't stop and look them look at them a long time but and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down you know uh sort of of sort of a basket type thing with the divisions right right so i just hadn't seen that in a long time uh-huh the carton the paper carton yeah well i mean the you you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do we were doing and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons the wood uh racks which now basically you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold uh twenty four bottles and and uh uh i'm not really say going back to good old days but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now yeah yeah well well it will be interesting to see how over the next year this all works out because like on the uh grass i'm i know your husband uh doesn't really like the paper sacks no he doesn't like the paper sacks and uh but he but you know he likes to pick the grass up too he doesn't doesn't just yeah i'm the i'm the same way because otherwise uh oh i'm i generally listen to Neal Sperry on Saturdays and Neal uh Neal's a person who says i like to pick it up but i don't believe in throwing it into the uh the landfill so i have my compost pile but most of us don't have the uh sufficient lot size to uh to do that right right uh so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on that's nice i guess they dump it the same place i wonder where they dump that the same place well there's someplace you know if it's because really when i look at what my grass does in in actually about twenty four hours uh knowing what the farmers do in rural areas they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally uh composts or stores and uh so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it and it will naturally decompose uh so you just have to kind of keep in separated and then uh who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into but it's it's certainly usable material yeah yeah well they must they must keep it separate if they have this date in they have this day now that it's you know separate from the other trash pick up uh-huh right um but i the thing i don't understand about that is like when it's one thing to send grass there but i've trimmed trees and other things which uh end up being something that clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly but it's still natural and i just don't know no  i really haven't seen any movies lately so when the computer picked this one i was a little bit surprised but i think i haven't been to the movie theater here in about oh six months but um you know the last movies that i've seen were probably on video oh well that's we rent a lot of videos too um we saw i have two little babies and we saw one movie recently and that was um The Terminator movie um which i didn't like after all yeah uh-huh yeah now i haven't i haven't seen The Terminator movie but and that's kind of blood and guts isn't it i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff well i don't either it on all the the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie he doesn't he maims them yeah right yeah he maims them pretty good doesn't he so um-hum he he uh i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part in the movie so yeah uh-huh i i saw uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh um i saw it uh oh couple weeks ago i rented it and um oh i haven't seen that one yet watched it and i was i was pretty disappointed in it because i i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense and i was pretty disappointed in it now it's it's a good movie but i guess uh that they built me up too much uh-huh oh yeah well it's for my expectations in it there with all the commercials uh and everything i haven't that's one we wanna see i i wanna see uh Dances With Wolves but we haven't seen that one yet either on video uh-huh uh-huh yeah now i haven't seen it either but uh i've heard that it's real long that it's a good movie but it's long like three hours yeah three that's what i heard too yeah we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late to watch it so we saw uh the the uh movie with uh Sylvester Stallone Oscar that's right that's right Oscar supposed to be his uh his debut in comedy which was an interesting movie but not very funny uh-huh yeah i know my daughter saw that and she liked it so yeah unfortunately did she well it was it was an amusing movie it just i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater as opposed to uh just at the house watching it with with no one else around so um-hum uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and of course i get to watch all these movies like Look Who's Talking and Who's Look Look Who's Talking Too and because i have a ten year old so we we watch a lot of movies oh around that category you know that she that she can watch um-hum my son just turned two and so The Little Mermaid is now our favorite movie yeah we seen The Little Mermaid too we've Little Mermaid and Peter Pan i think are are his two favorites that we've got um-hum um-hum and there's some i think there's some good Disney movies fixing to come out on video um Shipwrecked so oh i haven't i didn't hear that was coming out uh-huh yeah it's fixing to come out on video and boy i can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out well they just had uh The Rescuers movie that was a Disney movie wasn't it i think i heard that was just one was just out he's uh he doesn't sit still for the whole movie yet but he likes to uh um-hum right to listen to the music and stuff if there's a lot of that in the movie in the movie so that's um-hum well i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater well i well tell you ever since my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it yeah um-hum sometimes that's right and then they go to the dollar movies so um-hum that seems to happen i noticed that Dances With Wolves was playing at the uh Granada Theater uh-huh and uh someone said that was a lot of fun to go do you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie i thought that might be kind of fun to do yeah that does sound fun and of course you need a babysitter for that definitely but uh you know i'd really like to get out to the movies more often course it's so expensive now too right that you can't hardly afford it i i don't know we get discount tickets um-hum where my husband works but other than that it just seems like it's so expensive and then the popcorn and everything else you almost can't afford to do it that's right no matter what although we did actually get we went on vacation couple months ago and we got to go see What About Bob um-hum that was kind of a funny movie with uh Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray uh-huh that was fun golly i don't think that i've ever heard of that movie oh he's a Richard Dreyfuss is a uh psychiatrist and Bob is his patient and Bob follows him on vacation it's kind of oh that's the that's the one where they burn down the house or something the house explodes um-hum um-hum um-hum oh okay yeah that's the one okay yeah another movie that i wanna see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is um oh i just forgot the title of it um oh it's supposed to be a real scary one um darn well here here's another one that i've seen i saw um um i can't remember the title of it either um yeah it really did it's uh must have left an impression  it seems to be a a topic that's gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break i um wasn't raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out and they weren't worth anything anymore um-hum and we it took us um almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just don't drink that many so as far as at home use uh we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about a dollar it just really wasn't worth it yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasn't uh that was a big deal but and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it and then um TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there at least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up have y'all got the individual containers yet no i read in the paper this week where maybe i don't know if it was was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time hm but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that uh i'm not sure all what we're gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall it's been a long time they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin um-hum and all sorts different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly oh well and that at at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than um-hum than having a household try it but i i don't know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house well it'd get messy too yeah yeah i i i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot right and uh which we're not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that that's true they didn't even have cans they had bottles and you'd return them to the the grocery store and you'd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they don't seem still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but right i guess this day and age they don't yeah they don't do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them but um-hum uh they weren't that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and um-hum yeah and they uh people i i think kids don't appreciate maybe the value of money that it's so little that they don't care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many yeah just a little bit of begging will right they're the the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just don't seem to to care that that much about a small amount of money right well i wonder if but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years we've probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier yeah to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat right yep so that's the main reason we're we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles where do you take your cans well as you say it takes a while to build it up since we've had the crusher all summer we i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't taken oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the libraries  i guess that's all i do is that it yeah okay start them off um well i was thinking how the government has changed over in uh Europe and Russia oh yeah you know all those countries becoming democratic for one thing well uh i don't know what your age is but i know when i was growing up that uh um-hum i'm twenty seven communism course the big threat of communism McCarthyism back in the fifties and um-hum and everything there we lived our whole life under the fear of communism was going to get us and now communism is no more uh-huh so that makes a huge difference to us so it uh-huh and then i was thinking about how uh women's roles have changed uh uh i'm twenty seven by the way i was born in sixty four pardon me you were born in sixty four okay i'm older than that i'm forty four uh-huh okay okay i was born in forty seven so i've got a couple years on you and i can tell you that things uh-huh things have changed a tremendous amount for women in the world uh-huh uh-huh since i you know first started i'm not sure i i'm not sure they're better huh uh-huh that's because we might be liberated but now we all have to work and support ourselves and that's true but uh it has it's pluses and minuses i guess yeah i feel sorry for women who truly do wish to kind of follow the the older tradition and stay home and raise their family take care of the kids and people say what you don't work uh-huh uh-huh it's like a luxury now well yes i work all day long thank you very much uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's hard work but it's like you have to have a husband that makes very good money in order to do that i guess yeah the cost the cost of living has gone just sky rocketed uh-huh that's true what do you think as far as the social morals the morals of people today as opposed to well like uh my sister's younger than i am and i think that uh like they're all um hum uh well of course there's AIDS and i don't have to guess why you know because because just her generation will just like jump in bed with anybody you know i i i really do i feel you know i look back and i have two children i have a daughter who's fifteen and my son is twenty uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's scary and i mean it's very scary because they are living in a totally different time with totally different fears uh-huh uh-huh than i grew up in uh-huh you know five years ago uh-huh even ten years ago before the threat of AIDS entered uh-huh uh i think things were people were even possibly more promiscuous uh-huh because you know well it was live and let live and everybody have a good time and we won't even think about the consequences yeah i guess like in the sixties and the seventies i was i think the seventies maybe even the well in the eighties we started getting a uh-huh a taste of it uh and people started saying whoa wait a minute uh-huh uh-huh and i don't know i think there may even be a turnabout in the nineties not immediately uh-huh but as people become more and more terrified of the AIDS virus uh-huh uh-huh uh i think they're going to pull back sexually uh-huh i think they're going to pull back and we may find the pendulum swings you know the other way back the other way somewhat uh-huh i think you're right i i think we it has to uh-huh or our uh we we won't survive our our world won't survive unless they can get a cure unless they find a cure real soon for AIDS uh do you have children no i'm single you're single then you are in the midst of this uh-huh yes yeah i guess that's why i thought of it yeah and uh it's a different world for us uh-huh can you think of any other social issues government um no uh do you have any idea how long we have to talk just three minutes oh i didn't even look at the clock did you oh yeah it's been three minutes dear okay okay i've enjoyed talking to you same here okay bye uh-huh bye-bye nice nice meeting you bye-bye uh oh  okay well some of the things i like to do are i like to knit i knit sometimes and i sew um-hum and um i like to sew sometimes for my kids i i sew clothes for them every once in a while and i make quilts so um-hum oh wow that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery and i'm i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch and was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt after a while cross stitch i think i don't know i have to put it away and then i have to bring it back you know and and uh it gets boring um-hum um-hum i don't know why that is i don't know if it's looking at the little things little things every time well it just reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging i think yeah that might be it that might and yet there's uh but i do a a lot of it in the car we yeah we commute from Plano to Dallas oh do you oh so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done and i found that cross stitch is the easiest to do in the car oh i bet yeah i don't know that i could even think about quilting you have to have a pretty good frame don't you to do any kind of quilting work yeah yeah hm um i've not really done any too much challenging um stuff i i can do it with a a needle and thread you know um-hum but uh and get about five small stitches in which is pretty good but it's very long um-hum it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group you're not finishing a quilt in a long time oh i bet but it's such a lost art so uh so um i like to just mostly do the tie quilts that's so much easier uh-huh yes but uh the other ones are very pretty they're uh we have a quilt on our bed that's uh instead of like yarn um-hum they tied um ribbon into it oh and it's real pretty that's real pretty i bet there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother she had crocheted a full bedspread it's kind of a hobnail looking thing oh wow and when i look at it now she's been dead for a long time i think oh why didn't i learn these crafts and skills from her because she could crochet and do so many of the old things that aren't in vogue right now that uh-huh uh-huh people just don't know how to do now did you say you could knit no um-hum haven't tried that either oh well i was gonna say because i wanna learn to crochet i because if you could knit you could crochet it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to really to to weave the the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand um-hum and then you just use your right hand with the hook um-hum and that's not it's really not too difficult you could learn that i'm sure and pick that up if you i think if you can do any handicraft you can learn to crochet it's not too difficult yeah yeah uh-huh it's funny when you were talking about sewing i love to do anything by hand with a needle yeah but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine i never learned and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew isn't that interesting i think that's really interesting um-hum huh and yet you know i think about you know you said you do a lot of needlework and and there are some beautiful just gorgeous patterns um-hum that people do and i i just think that um that's one of one of the arts that i think are real pretty and a lot of people don't do that either um-hum you know and so well it's hard to find the time i i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably because at night if i sit down i'm doing something with the kids or yeah yeah yeah just not sitting down at all yeah that's true you know and and i always think well i can do this while i watch TV or something you know um-hum and um it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else and then it doesn't well and i'm at the age where bifocers or trifocals would be necessary and so i find myself putting glasses on to quite work or to watch TV and then taking them off to do needlework and i get frustrated doing that so just give it up yeah and you know i like to sketch i can i can sketch something like if i see a picture like out of a book i can sketch that ooh that does and that's nice and everything but you know it's funny i can't i can't draw it out of my own head kind of thing i wish i could and and yet i can't do you know like like uh craft uh on wood um-hum uh-huh i can't do that painting thing and yet yeah i'm the same way if i see something i can copy it but i certainly can't create i admire people that have that in their minds already yeah me too me too i know a woman who's just wonderful at that and um-hum and i look at it and you know you look at those things and you wish so badly that you could do them i guess if you wanted to you could take classes and learn i guess that's the only way i could do it well sometimes even with that yeah i i think you have to have some  well course my favorite team there is the Texas Rangers so i watch them all the time and who do you watch uh the Mets but i don't do that anymore because uh they're doing lousy i don't know the Mets this isn't their best season is it no no well the Rangers are the few games behind Minnesota but if we could win the next oh i guess we'd win have to win most all of them we could still go to the to the race to do the i think you're uh definitely an avid fan huh well i watched the two games the last two nights so they just i gave up on the Mets around August you know oh is that right how many games out is Texas pardon how many games out are they i think they're out six and so they have to still win almost every single game that they have to play to the end now right right yeah i think Minnesota's got to get like three wins or or Texas has to lose three games or some combination of that well maybe next year or else yeah yeah i don't know Minnesota's won a good game they're they're doing a good job this year i don't know yeah they they are they are they really but i'm gonna watch tonight because Nolan Ryan's gonna pitch so i always like to watch him pitch yeah who's who's who he used to be on the Mets a long time ago but who's who's who else is like Texas's big players that that uh yeah um-hum well uh we just traded Buechele and i really liked him but but he's gone now so i i guess uh Sierra i like to watch him bat right Ruben right he's supposed to be good yeah he's he's really good Franco's good except that uh he's got injuries right now his hamstring's down in the bottom of his legs he can't run very well but it he usually hits a home run then he just trots around the bases it's okay and um he's the shortstop though right Franco yeah well they've moved him now since he can't move that quickly since it hurts him right they moved him to second base and they moved Petralli into that area in that runs now in between the shortstop area and he takes second base and Sierra's an outfielder um Sierra let's see yeah Sierra's into is he middle field or left field he's not left field he must be center field yeah i don't see i don't know the American League that well once in a while i watch the Yankees um but rarely and uh but this guy that i'm i work with is in this rotisserie league where they they choose do you oh now what's that i don't know what that is well you choose players and you do stuff based on stats and everything like that so he's always talking to me about the American League oh like he gets points for every time uh i think he has Ruben Sierra on his team and every time he hits a home run or steals a base or gets a hit he gets a certain amount of points and then you get pitchers and stuff like that oh oh so he's always talking about the American League which is like i said because i watch the Mets i don't really know that much about the American League yeah that's hard you're not an Astro fan um no not too not too much i i guess i just don't watch them that much um i like to watch the Oakland A's play they have a lot of good players too but i haven't watched them for a while so i don't know how they're doing too well this season no they're not they they were doing well for a while but then they kind of fell off do you get all the games out there i mean you get you get to watch the A's a lot and stuff like that um once every so often mostly Rangers games come on because that's our area but um right every once in a while on a Saturday or a Sunday they'll put a another league on you know right but it's it just depends how to you know how they fill the time sometimes anyway i um we got this is my first conversation through this Texas Instruments thing what this is the first time i've done one of these conversations yeah oh is it oh well that's kind of fun so i didn't even expect it i just i happened to have the uh i didn't even know what my um my personal identification number was i just happened to have the folder right in front of me i'm glad i brought it into work just yeah uh isn't it's a fun thing i think you'll like it it's a it's a old thing to do and um anyway we just uh if you get run out of things to say then you say good bye it was nice talking to you too okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you and have a good day um bye-bye okay bye-bye  the AIDS issue is is a bit of a problem i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem is is the financial end i mean how can a country stand to uh spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem uh but then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the the knowledge or at least the the rumor i'm not really sure if it's true or not that uh we're not spending as much per let's say afflicted person on cancer uh there's some uh take breast cancer for instance it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting much more people mean more people than AIDS and yet uh more people die of it and yet the funding is already uh exceeded AIDS has more money than uh breast cancer and well that's interesting isn't it yeah so uh i mean if it's true i i've i've always heard these things i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure but uh i've heard it on more than one documentary that uh they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions uh or whatever institutions raise the money and uh it's just one big PR campaign that yeah we think that's the world's worst thing so let's give money to AIDS and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years and it's just one of those right well of course one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesn't effect men it's not gonna get funded and uh having thought about that for a while what did you think about that idea well i i kind of i thought well that that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing but then i got i got to thinking the the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate and there's only one test that just recently got developed uh a blood antigen antigen uh antibody test for the antigen in the blood and that's fairly recent and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years hm they've not really given it attention either yeah so it's not really cure for yeah it's not uh not that heavily funded either and that seems to be one of the the major uh problems that men have in the realm of cancer so i don't know i i guess there's just some strange public opinion as to who they want to give to um be it through different organizations March of Dimes type uh telethons or or bicycle rides or whatever how they fund whatever um illness they wish it's it's kind of hard to right to get an even keel on that i mean it's really hard to say well there's you know a hundred thousand per year affected by this one so let's give it this amount and then this other one's only a tenth of that so give it a tenth of that and and just keep doling it out that way or well i'm i'm glad i'm not the one that's that's in charge of of making those decisions they uh you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious you know i mean it's not so serious i guess until it affects your family and then all the sudden it's the most important thing right so i i would hate to have that responsibility just personally but but then again we really we really do have it as a society just decides which things we need to address i uh i guess i it it frightens me to think of so many people with with AIDS and with cancer and many of those things um if they're not able to to be insured then the country's gonna pay for it one way or the other right whether it's through prevention or or treatment or you know just uh just helping the people when they are not able to take care of themselves so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it that's true you know the the other thought that i had um i've had several minutes to think about this after i uh while i was finding people i uh i could think about the topic longer than the person that receives it so it's kind of a a unfair advantage as they were but the other thing that i've thought of on this is i wonder if there isn't enough money uh in our economy or in our system uh it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good i mean yeah they're kind of nice but we have such an affluent society society that i wonder if if we took a little from here and there and the other if we might wind up with a uh cure for just about everything of course then we wouldn't have any room to put people but that's just change our priorities right just change our priorities a little bit and yeah you know you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza or you hear these these phenomenal amount of dollars spent for this that or the other and then you have all the arts that that are nice and aesthetic but right are they that enhancing for the masses for the masses you know they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that but uh had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else  okay um well it's not such a bad idea to think about judges uh you know taking the idea of uh uh sentencing in into their hands versus you know the jury especially if it's a highly publicized case such as uh you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read uh certain uh things in regards to cases like the Dahmer case in Milwaukee and stuff so it's it may be an idea to think about you know cost trying to find a jury so you can get a jury as far as yeah um they may say they're not biased but deep down they are against against this person or whatever so um i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about so right that a that a a a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next and not not depend and and uh exactly not depend so much on the on the emotions of a particular case but be able to put it in overall perspective well i i i certainly haven't thought much about this but um um-hum yeah yes yes some of them some of them do and some of them don't but uh this one uh catches you off guard doesn't it i was trying to remember back it seems to me that that you know when i studied civics in school or stuff that this um-hum the juries being involved in the sentencing wasn't wasn't so much and i'm i'm trying to figure out whether that's i'm remembering wrong or whether that's a by state i didn't think they were either i thought the sentencing was done by the judge and it's either guilty or not guilty yeah yeah and uh i guess i guess uh and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some changes Supreme Supreme Court decision perhaps that said that uh that uh as part of the trial by the peers that i had to include the sentencing or too or whatever i'd yeah but i um-hum yeah i i certainly wouldn't be uh uh worried about that i guess in terms of the uh uh you know having having a judge do it would seem to me to be more more fair and and uh unbiased uh oh sure yeah yeah in terms of doing away with the with the unanimous jury i guess i guess i uh would be a little more leery of that kind of a change in in a trial system that that's just a such a tradition that it's a that it's got to be a unanimous jury that uh exactly exactly i don't know where you'd where you'd draw the line anywhere else uh you know uh two thirds or three fourths or whatever but uh yeah yeah um-hum and and i i i certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a just a bare majority um exactly uh-huh yeah that's kind of how i you knows in certain cases i can see them going uh uh just basically with a judge guilty or not guilty verdict yeah yeah uh simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small um maybe uh you did a crime that was uh burglary or whatever and it goes into the court case or whatever and it's not highly publicized but when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the National Enquirer or whatever whatever yeah um it's the idea that a person might initially have this thought well jeez this person's guilty no matter what i'm not gonna listen to the facts or and and yeah con their way into uh getting past the lawyers and and getting through that but um also there's the aspect of cost and i i'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for uh the judicial system to try and call a jury whether it's uh very costly or if it's something that's not costly or what you know being that i'm not in the that area i really don't know but i wonder yeah if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work or at least give them the time off yeah from work uh whether it i think it's with pay if i remember jury duty is with pay well and and i'm i'd i'd i know it is i know it is where i where i work but i'm not sure that that's and uh it's not it hm that that's necessarily required uh you know by law that it has to be paid um paid right i suspect that's a that's a benefit of a bigger company but but there are certainly some um-hum some that may decide not to some that some that wouldn't uh yeah hm  okay well originally i guess women were um in the house cooking and uh cleaning and all that good stuff taking care of children oh yeah oh actually the children they they don't have as many children these days that's right because they've gone out to work and they're um uh well the families of shrinking the divorce rate is up um they're still trying to get the pay that uh the men get um i guess even farther back um they uh used to not even have sports for the women um-hum and uh then the women starting wearing the tennis shoes and playing sports and going out to work um well i i was thinking too in terms of of in terms of this you know the education is so different i think women are so much better educated now than they used to be and i think that makes a big impact on what women do oh sure um also i was thinking the the clothing has changed so dramatically uh you know you like when you said with sports i thought well it was so limiting because of their clothes um-hum uh-huh they weren't allowed to to wear certain things and so then they couldn't participate you know they couldn't participate in sports because of it so um i thought that's that's made a difference uh uh-huh yeah well it's kind of ironic they're also these days they're trying they're working their way back into the house um-hum and they're trying to have the best of both worlds um-hum and they're just now figuring out in the Nineties that it's not quite working right and they can't have both yeah so um i guess they'll have to make a choice well i think so or spend part of their lives doing one thing and part of their lives doing another you know it right they'll just have to allocate that time yeah uh because you know because really it isn't that long a period of time that you have to be home with children uh comparatively speaking if you look look through your whole look at your whole life um and i do think there's real value in being in the home uh i do sort of both but um um-hum you know it it is it's an interesting topic i the thing that's been hard for me to believe too is that how long how short a time it's been since the women had the vote and that's always been amazing to me um-hum that that's been a relatively short period of time and i think that made a major impact on women's roles uh you know from that point on um um-hum well i guess the men have definitely figured out that women are as smart i there's a considerable amount more um there's a considerable more amount of doctors these days than there used to have been and of course you like you said they're more educated that's right and um uh we've we've uh brought quite a bit to the world well and it will be fascinating to see within the next twenty to thirty years how that changes even more i think the impact will be felt more and more as as better educated women come into the work force um and more and more women come into the work force um um-hum i you know it it's going to just change things drastically i think well some women are actually leaving the husbands home with the kids that's right that's right and well i don't wanna talk about the husband's changing roles but they're all they're learning to cook now and to do the laundry and uh all of those good things well i think that you know that one of the things that may come out of this is to let people do what they're best at you know some people uh may men may stay home with children better than some women may and so whoever um-hum you know whoever does which role best i think should do it um um-hum if if people can compromise and do that kind of thing um-hum that that takes a lot of yeah it's no surprise that uh movies like Dances with Wolves have come out in the Nineties uh-huh and their influence uh with the men um-hum and uh the changing of roles actually um-hum um-hum uh that was a very good example of women in the Nineties and what's a real man and a real woman you know they uh they do a little bit of both um the hard labor and uh yes you know the smart the uh all brawn and no brains on both sides that's right that's right well i think that's all i have to say do you have anymore nice talking to you thanks bye-bye okay well it was nice talking to you okay thank you bye  okay did you see Robin Hood yes yes uh-huh what do you think about that i thought it was good as a matter of fact um i was the generation that i didn't think i'd like it uh-huh uh-huh because you know i had seen the original uh-huh and i thought uh did you too i haven't no huh-uh well i just thought oh if i go and you know see this one i'm going to be disappointed but we thoroughly my husband and i went and we thoroughly enjoyed it uh-huh good i just heard that the critics thought that that song at the end was kind of dumb yes well did you know that the um what was it you know where they did the arrow through the um-hum that special effect air was supposed to be a promo uh-huh and they had just done it to promote the movie for a TV ad and they thought it was so good that they included it in the movie itself oh uh-huh um i think i heard it even won an award or something that scene yes yeah won several it was it was it was really good i'm impressed with Kevin Costner i really am um-hum especially that one waterfall scene yes oh he likes to show his rear he did that in um Dances with Wolves Dances with Wolves uh-huh i knew they were gonna show his butt in there somewhere and um if he doesn't keep getting a tan he'll be in trouble uh-huh did you see um Terminator Two no uh-huh that was pretty good no those i saw Terminator one and my husband went on his own to see that one hm um-hum i don't know if i saw the first one but the second one had real good special effects did it um-hum oh uh matter of fact i'm working with somebody that helped work on that movie oh how neat i teach and she's a art teacher and um she came from California and she helped with the special effects out there oh how interesting uh-huh where do you oh we can't talk about where you work personal stuff uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um did you see Problem Child 2 i'm seeing all these sequels no no no well see my problem is um i teach school and so those movies that by the time the kids finish telling me about them i don't go see them yep uh-huh uh-huh because they told you every last detail um-hum uh i'm trying to think of what else i've seen um oh what was the one with the guy that had amnesia the lawyer uh i don't know um oh it was so good now it's my names escape me um a lawyer with amnesia who was in it oh gosh i might try to look through the paper and see okay that's a good idea i didn't have a paper oh let's see what we have it was about a doctor who had amnesia uh not doctor lawyer um-hum um-hum and he was a real hustly bustly kind of person um-hum and then he got amnesia and sort of slowed down and nobody was used to him he had servants at home and very very rich and hm i have no idea when he went through his thing his whole personality changed um-hum hum and i'm trying to remember the title of it oh is that that Regarding Henry um-hum yes it was Regarding Henry i didn't know he was a lawyer in the movie i didn't see it okay yeah i thought i'm pretty sure he was and he was like out for everybody's uh-huh huh you know to get everybody and to swing deals and do things that were um-hum um-hum borderline he never did anything illegal but so did he change for the better after that or huh yes yes well he wouldn't defend a case because he knew they were lying that's strange and he was the one that set up the lie for them and is that based on a true story do you know or i don't think so because we you know doctors and amnesia case too and hm um-hum then i had seen something on television um-hum so i think amnesia was in this year um um-hum is that what happened to that movie with William Hurt do you know that he's in now um is that his name or John Hurt what was that again isn't there some movie about a doctor that something happened to him is that the same one you're talking about did he get amnesia yes yeah that was released that was called The Doctor and that was released after Regarding Henry uh-huh did you see that hm but i didn't go see that because i felt like i had enough of one theme already seen it um-hum uh trying to think what else i haven't seen any of the new ones though uh-huh me neither hm well do you think we've talked long enough for the the thing i don't know if we've gotten five minutes in i didn't look at my clock oh is it five because someone told me it was three three let me check my thing bet she's gonna hate us when she has to transcribe all this uh-huh okay okay let's see i'm still trying to think of something else i've seen but yeah well i'm looking at the paper and i don't see anything okay hm i don't i don't see it  i'm doing fine um my name's yeah i'm from uh New York where you from what's what was your name uh Brad LeMeaux oh i'm Nola and i'm in Plano Texas Nola in Texas i i talked to someone from Texas yesterday where in Texas you say it's Plano it's just north of Dallas okay you have pets uh oh pets yes do you have pets yeah that's what the topic's supposed to be yeah i didn't quite understand what you said i'm sorry i got my New York accent we don't have uh i grew up in New Jersey but it's been a long time since i lived there did you already push the one okay um yeah we have fish that's it yes that's pretty easy yeah it's uh uh uh neither my husband or i really wanted to take care of cats or dogs or anything like that so and the girls kind of wanted something we have four uh well now we have four girls when we got the fish to start with we had two or three but um what the for some reason i just decided to start a fish tank and set up a ten gallon fish tank and it started with the some uh we had a real hard time getting it established tried the goldfish and they were just filthy could not keep the tank clean um eventually i took them back to the store and started started all over again and i had another couple of kinds that ate each other so that bunch didn't work either what type were they like sicklets and stuff like that um there were some neons and a couple of other kind i can't remember what they were i don't know if the but but they didn't get along very well whatever they were i i had fish that were like they were called sicklets a type of family this is when i was a kid they they had um what are they called like oscars and uh i forgot the different names that they had but they would eat eat they would actually they ate when they got big enough they would eat goldfish we would buy goldfish and feed them to them yeah huh well these were not supposed to be an aggressive kind like that but they were and uh they i could see them picking on each other yeah i i agree with that i i i um i don't really wanna deal with any other pets except for stuff like fish i i thought about i've often thought about getting a fish tank but even that's too much work for me yeah yeah anyway i finally got rid of those those all killed each other off and i cleaned the tank up again and got it all fixed again and so established and i got about half a dozen guppies from a friend and they just bred and bred and bred and they're uh there must've been a hundred guppies in that tank and i had i took i must've taken thirty or forty of them at a time back to the store two or three different times because there were so many of them i couldn't keep them down but and what did they do they they just took them back they took them back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time yeah really yeah that's so yeah helped to buy fish food and filters yeah that's what my friend used to do with his other fish he used to sell them back to the store they'd buy them but uh that's cool that's uh-huh but but but uh then i i i i went for a while where um while i was pregnant with our new little baby we uh i i just kept forgetting to clean the fish tank and it was really dirty for a long time but those fish still lived in there and um finally i cleaned the tank out and most of them had disappeared um and i don't think i've got any males in there anymore so they're not multiplying anymore that's easier yeah yeah i need to get a new um algae eater though do you do you still you still have guppies yep there's still there's about a dozen guppies in there right now so you you stayed with the guppies great great yeah the fish are fun so but that's the only thing we've got yes you may i know sorry and and so you have fish or do you have no i i used to have fish when i was a kid but you don't have anything right now but i don't have anything now i i guess when i moved out of my parent's house i uh gave my fish to my friends and fish tank i think i gave to someone else um but i thought a few years ago go and get one but i've moved around so much recently yeah it's kind of a problem moving them yeah they're not that easy but although it like living in New York City there's definitely no other pet that you would want i mean people some people a lot of people have cats some people have dogs i mean i've i've even seen big big dogs in small apartments and i don't really see that you feel sorry for them yeah someday if i move out into the country i like it like a you know like a Labrador or something like that some you know bigger dog that could kind of run around outside and stuff yeah but yeah you see these big dog i mean i see this guy in my building with some i think it's like a golden retriever or something like that and he he's good though he takes him out all the time or her out all the time uh-huh you'd have to do it an awful lot though yeah this guy he seems like he runs and stuff and runs with the dog so he probably gets in enough exercise yeah but you know lot  they suggested some sort of a recipe uh for um company for entertaining did you have anything in mind that uh you'd like to share well i uh just had a Christmas Around the World party the other night and had some hors d'oeuvres and ooh uh-huh and i fixed uh a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy it's uh ooh that sounds good what it's like uh eight ounces of cream cheese softened and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice one tablespoon Worcester sauce um-hum and mix it and spread it out onto a plate and i see one tablespoon of Worcester uh-huh okay and then you take and uh cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on Triscuit crackers oh that and that always goes over real well and it's real easy how much chili sauce did you say it's one of the small bottles like eight not eight ounces that would be a lot i don't think uh it well it's about eight ounces it it uh-huh is it okay this would make a lot right yeah it would probably make well it it doesn't make quite as much as you think but yeah spread out because you you keep the cream cheese kind of thin and how much crab meat did you use one tin of the flake uh-huh and drain it real good one one can of flake oh okay have you ever used the uh imitation yet um-hum yes i have i used it uh last Christmas time uh what did i put it in i think i just served it by itself there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff ooh that sounds i've tried it and then i have it here on hand for about a week and all of a sudden it dawned on me wait is this totally imitation and then i found out i went back to the store and they said it is a fish product uh-huh uh-huh so therefore you really don't have a very long life you know once you buy it i thought so you know they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is you know right right that's very true very true i had bought a cheesecake uh and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be refrozen which i felt was real nice oh that's a good idea whose was that yeah it uh was uh Lawry's i believe or Lawler's and i got it do you have a Sam's wholesale warehouse up there it's real uh uh Sam's right right yeah okay that's where i picked it up and it comes out of Chicago and they're very good cheesecakes oh oh that sounds good because that's great that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant yeah yes yes and they have and they have the little papers between them okay i i've right oh hey that sound and i think they're what about nine dollars and something right and it's something good to have on hand too it's frozen in the first place right so you can uh it is frozen isn't it yes yes yes yes it is frozen and i thaw it and then you can refreeze it and uh-huh it was they're very good very good and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts and then you can refreeze hey that sounds great that sounds oh do you and that's my favorite and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it is it oh i love to eat it but i don't like to make it it takes time and you have to rack your brain and time i don't have anymore that's the that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve i i said i can make it in no time it's trying to think uh-huh it is and then we just uh built a new home and i have one of these kitchens that the center of the house and so no matter where they're at your company can see you cooking which is funny uh-huh that's right and your mess well this is what everyone has said they said it's okay for you because you keep a real neat kitchen and i said yes i decided it looks better in Better Homes and Gardens than it does in practicality yeah but uh what i have learned in the uh ten months we've lived here is that when i entertain i have to have my foods all prepared and in the oven with all the everything through ready to serve because with the open area you don't want someone from your dining room seeing your mess like you said so you have to have the picturesque kitchen you know right out of the magazine yeah right right that's that's right well i like to have mine all done anyway because then i want to i want to party too i don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something you know you're right and you know the funny thing is now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that i still have people trying to come in you know they'll come in the kitchen and i said out we have the chairs on the other side of the counter for for guests you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen correct sounds and it it it has worked out but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining uh well enough that they know you know it's very much at home type situation right well a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples again that we've known a long time like you they uh we all bring things and it sure makes it a whole lot easier anymore oh we even have a better one now we decided that we all meet we have it worked worked  okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess i'll start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and i feel i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such i'd feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what i've been hearing in the newspapers so i really don't have a problem with it yeah uh i don't either i uh i've never worked i don't work at home right now i stay home with my children um but my husband works and they do have that at at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it we've particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such it's uh it's a scary thing to know that uh you just don't know what people are doing uh before they go to work um-hum so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so um there've been so many you know there's uh yeah just about like train train train wrecks and things like that that i feel like probably just for our own safety and when we're traveling and things that would be something i'd like to know that's going on yeah i well i happen to be uh my job is i'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company so i it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing and i am pushing towards that i i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide um they shouldn't have a problem with it right and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because we're talking we're talking major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees um-hum and i really you know they they're talking about sports sports personalities and all this type of thing but i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested yeah on a random basis i i have a real fear of that at some point something's going to happen and they're showing it with AIDS so why you know they should they ought to start doing something with the drugs so i really have no problem with it yeah well it's it's unfortunate i think that everyone doesn't have that opinion um some people just yeah i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh in the long run it seems to me it's kind of like what they keep talking about the um the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel that's not fair and whatever but um-hum you know those kind of things too i'd like to know myself it wouldn't be in my opinion i i've had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all so yes oh really that kind of yeah and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me um but well that scares me because if this that's the way they are i if i were a dentist i'd wanna be protected too well you would think so that is because well and i worked for a dentist and that's uh you know you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that and um-hum it's real real dangerous i i would think but with all the accidents um-hum just with with uh everything happening just airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now you know just because they don't know what their pilot's been doing and and things like that and right um-hum i don't know well you where you're located i i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing uh-huh and i think they've had it for several years and their program they had i don't think had a lot of uh problems associated with it but uh my brother-in-law happens to work there and it it sounded very positive and i i think it's great i i would like i would encourage it i'm pushing our company towards that and also well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support right exactly and and whatever because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things and um-hum too many people are just dying particularly in our area i don't know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical right ours is changing yeah ours ours is changing it's increasing i live in a i live in a very nice suburb and it's it's it's unbelievable what what what's going on and the drugs the selling of drugs it's just it's just too loose it's too free um-hum i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these i i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husband's office it's talking about these uh drug tattoos now um-hum really that they have got that look like it looks like a sticker and it's for kids  is uh kind of fun it's best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now and i grew up in an area that uh it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and uh sailing was was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and um more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm front blowing in and soon as the front came over it was calm so you're out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away and that didn't always work we often times got wet but um it's it's a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess what are your memories of boating or current um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husband's family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um you know they you they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the the laws were there and if you didn't obey them uh right you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun it's true yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres and it was uh it had a lot of um turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didn't hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go oh and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didn't even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and i'll be if he didn't do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didn't go very far but i got up and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me i've i've uh done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i i i know how you can get injured doing much more than that and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess so life changes a little bit in that respect i'd kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesn't have a uh well what they call trick skis they'll allow you to ski backwards i haven't craft managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh that sounds like a real challenge yeah it it'd be kind of nice i hadn't quite figured out i don't have anybody to teach me either that's another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what i've seen you just kind of work work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around but uh i don't know maybe someday i'll uh-huh i'll get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something hm well my son  basically um my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases we really don't get into small little purchases if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card but other than that it's not something that we use a lot of um we may have only two or three versus um i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or uh up to a dozen credit cards but um ours are just major credit cards that we have and uh use uh use only when when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase yeah is that like Visa and and MasterCard yeah yeah do you have department store credit cards too or uh yeah one Sears uh-huh Sears is pretty major with us simply because we do um appliances appliances and things like that and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that so yeah but uh we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate if you've got the cash to pay for something it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two three month period but yeah if it's uh any large purchases um you've got to kind of think about um how much you're going to put down as far as uh payments on it so that you're not getting eighteen percent or twenty percent interest taken off so right my my husband and i do basically the same thing but we we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise uh-huh we still pay it off every month if it kills us but we do it mainly for you know the cash flow what is that yeah yeah yeah oh float that's the word float and i often will keep track track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook already uh-huh sure sure uh-huh sure so you know and sometimes just and keep a list and make sure i sure i don't go over a certain limit especially around birthdays you know yeah exactly exactly yeah oh if we go out to a restaurant oh just to float it or i don't know or if it's a business transaction a lot of times that's important too to keep a better receipt of it so yeah yeah yes my husband has a uh or anytime like a plane ticket or you know um-hum even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but um-hum the float for more than a hundred dollars seems real nice for that sure oh sure for the month or whatever that thirty days or whatever yeah exactly we have a new one from AT&T and we have you know haven't used that one too much be interesting that's nice because you can use it for a calling card also so uh-huh yeah exactly sure it's a MasterCard too so it's kind of fun uh but you get a lot of junk mail about them sure yeah oh yeah and you always get these preapproved uh credit card things coming through uh your credit is great so let's send you another credit card or it's preapproved for yeah you're such a a wonderful person such such to entice you to get more credit cards we'll give you five thousand dollars up front yeah and so you know we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit i mean you know you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff so right do you have uh uh an annual fee on yours or do you get yours through a bank or uh ours is through a bank yeah we had it a long time ago through a banking system so yeah just a but yeah yeah i i can't see paying an annual fee for it i mean i almost oh you're already paying them uh if you're if you don't pay it off within that month interest anyway so yeah that's exactly it yeah so okay well it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise so that okay all right thanks a lot by now good talking to you thanks bye-bye  where is your favorite place to go well we haven't traveled outside the United States that much um we usually take family type vacations we're looking forward to one in October to Disneyworld in Florida oh that's great have you ever been there a have a nine year old when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball oh that's a perfect age for Disneyworld uh-huh i think so too oh that's great yeah so we've been there a number of times and uh we're going next year we have a business trip every fall well we go on a lot of business trips i oh wonderful so you travel a lot i don't work well we do we go my husband travels a couple times a month and in the position he's in they don't care if i go along uh-huh so it's great i just kind of join up when it's something interesting and uh Disneyworld is the one for a week next year sure um-hum and it'll be at this time of the year and this year we're leaving um uh matter of fact we're leaving next Saturday for New Orleans oh that'll be fun too yes we went years ago we haven't been lately and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything but we used to have a lot of fun there have have you ever been there well you know we went there once in fact we had been in Dallas and we were on our way home and we were driving and we said let's go to New Orleans so when he said well this year you know i have a week there on a a project he's going to be and then i said well i'll go along i hope it's swimming season because it wasn't a tremendous thing not amount of things to do that i wanted to do there uh-huh yeah if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping there isn't much there but that can be fun it well and and that's probably we do like the night life to an extent and they do have a Mardi Gras night planned um-hum and i'm kind of anxious for that but um yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better did you know that next week there's several TV shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary no i know this is a real good time to go because they are having so many activities and special shows well and with a daughter nine it is just she's old enough to really grasp the meaning behind yes be excited about all of it uh if so uh well if you're working then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go well not really uh we're doing the same thing tying it in with my husband's business trip and i just save vacation for things like that and uh just travel whenever we can oh that's well i really i think travel when i heard my topic today i thought okay that's my favorite that's my favorite because how easy right and really at our point of life our children are grown and um it has just worked out really well with this um position he's in because i can go at a spur of the moment or what have you and it depends where he's going um-hum whether or not i decide to go along but i do do like to travel and it's um i don't mind the pool life at all during the day and i like to sightseeing and i love to shop sure um-hum um-hum so that's perfect what more could you ask for so it's that's right but if this and then get to pick and choose the places well and one of my very favorite is Las Vegas um that i would have to say we both end up going to Las Vegas um probably once every maybe year and a half ah uh-huh and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets because we have a lot of flying with Continental um-hum um-hum and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of Continental and i said now that we have all the miles we better start using them right it's kind of shaky that's true it really is uh so we are thinking that we might go to Las Vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip um when we normally go that way we like to go to California at the same time because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably from Texas um-hum our last big trip we drove through New Mexico and Colorado and went to the Grand Canyon and and uh back through Silverton and Durango and oh it was fun it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it our i think that's a good trip and really for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent um-hum right now we did what we sometimes do since we are in Ohio and it takes a while just to even get to the what i would call the more picturesque part of the country we will fly to something like once we flew to Colorado to Denver and then we rented a car for two weeks and we went through the northern route and through Utah um-hum and as far west as Las Vegas and then we returned through uh New Mexico that you just mentioned and it was oh it was just great um-hum oh there's so too much to see really you just oh i i think that's that's the way to  the budget seems to be oh on a number of people's minds and often times when peoples talk about cutting budget or wishing that the government didn't spend money here and there i hear them talk about uh cutting what they call aid to some foreign countries and people don't understand why are we give a million here or a billion there and and whether they like it or not or whether they understand it or not the government just simply develops dependencies on us uh you start giving a country uh x amount of dollars for so many years and their whole economy and their whole uh system is uh used to it and then you threaten with whatever you wish you know you would say well you're not acting right we're gonna withhold it or you're not doing this that or the other or we want our base here or we want whatever and the government's been doing that for years and will probably continue to do that for years and i'm not sure if the general public uh thinks about it that way when they start saying why did we give money here or money there and but there are some things even when we what we spend in inside the US it seems a little far fetched and not necessarily for the common good uh lot of the money for the arts seem to benefit only a few and usually those who are um rich anyway or have enough have enough money to attend those kind of functions so it's that's a a controversy of course there's only a hundred and seventy million going to the NEA but a hundred and seventy million's a bit and it's something so what would you do or cut or change in the budget well um i agree with you on the international aid and um i don't think a lot of people realize too on we can't live isolated our world is such an international economy now and um uh especially with the problems in Eastern Europe and Russia uh i know a lot of people feel that we've given so much aid and we have so many economic problems and and i agree that we do but um it's also in our country's interest um to have a balanced world economy um sometimes it does seem like we're the ones doing all the giving um and i have to admit sometimes i have wondered if uh um-hum we run into problems which is is certainly a possibility if anyone would come to lend us a hand but um right i do think uh this is a hard area i'm there's some areas that i feel uh need a lot of work um and improvement and education comes to mind i know they are working on trimming defense um this has been such a long process that has gotten us to the point that we're in but unless they start working on it um it really it it already is is close to uncontrollable um-hum but i'm not sure exactly what practical uh steps uh could be um i wish i had some of the figures in front of me now to know the percentage um i do think one step once something you touched on in talking about the arts is that as far as percentages go i think uh money should go that benefits the most um i say uh i believe in um education and not necessarily the federal um it can be done on on different levels too because i think that's our future if we um if our education system falls behind that of say Germany and Japan and um some of the other countries we need to be able to be competitive um um-hum it's that's an area i would not want cut there are a lot of areas i think that money could be better spent i think sometimes the money they spend on studies to decide on things is way out of proportion and and of course everyone's heard the stories of the several thousand dollar hammer and um you know somewhere along the line um there've been some gross errors most of the the national or the federal dollars that go toward any project uh people tend to want accountability but they don't want the so-called bigger government so they they wanna have fewer government employee  all right why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next i think our next car i would like something like a an economy car that gets really good mileage and um one that's really reliable i would i think probably not an a brand new car but maybe something like a Nissan Sentra or something like that um something my husband can um-hum and of course it has to have air conditioning oh absolutely air air conditioning and a radio uh AM FM and a cassette player and um what else do i want does it have to be a special color um i would think kind of a subdued color would be nice you know a a navy blue or a it sounds like something your husband would drive right yeah that's what it would be for is for him to drive back and forth to work yeah well i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one but when we were looking we were looking for something had enough seat belts of course and we wanted air conditioning and a five speed and that was kind of iffy but that made it better economically so i think that's something we might want too is some kind of standard transmission at least rather than automatic yeah we'll probably have to look for a another second car sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for something but probably real cheap it wouldn't be a used used car so but no i think we would want one that even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that um you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed um-hum would you like four doors or it doesn't really matter uh probably well probably probably that would be a good idea yeah hm yeah it it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes so that's right so if we wanted it to take people out with it that's a good thought i it be fun just to win one wouldn't it that would be great alrighty well i i think that's all that we need to say that hadn't crossed my mind yes i would go for that well thank you for calling all right we'll talk to you later bye bye all right good-bye  uh i work at TI and we have um of course started drug testing um random drug testing here and um i haven't gotten called yet but um i feel that it's probably pretty it's pretty good if if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs do they feel that way um i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at TI but i think our latest statistic statistic said something like ninety nine point nine eight percent were uh testing negative on all the drug on on all the testing um-hum well i i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to to the drugs i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it it's uh i don't know i don't really liken it uh-huh um-hum to alcohol but yet that can be carried to an extreme too so i think it's a good idea and i think just the idea that you know that you may be tested might keep you off of them or get you off of them because you're um-hum right i don't know that their job would be at risk because i think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs i would think that is that how they do it at TI maybe that right right i at TI if you get called in and you test positive for drugs then you're put on a program and um you know you go through the program and then you're called like six months after you complete the program program and if you test positive then you're terminated um-hum well i guess i i draw a hard line but you know i would i'm i'm in favor of of that type of thing that um yeah uh-huh you you have people out there that are responsible for certain things and you expect them to do their job and it it is possible that you know that they can't do as good a job um as they might do uh-huh that's right um-hum oh and of course they can also cause injury to other people if they're if they're not uh you know fully functional um-hum mentally while they're doing their job they could cause you know serious injury to other another people um-hum right and you never know they could just go off the deep end on on a on something uh that whatever they're taking at the time and and it would be uh uh-huh you know out of the question also i guess you can you know get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself just by having a wrong mix of or watered down or or whatever all kinds i sub in the schools so i've you know had a uh-huh that's right oh yeah uh-huh so right they they talk a lot about drugs there and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools right but you know i think they can test all they want for drugs you know and um-hum if they need to do that as a condition for employment and i know many of them are doing it i know my son has had to do it for both Sam's and Wal-Mart and i don't know how many others are um-hum uh-huh doing that and and i think that's good because so many of the kids that are on them are sort of bums that they need to get their life straightened up at an early age and uh oh yes um-hum that's right i don't know it's just a problem that problem no one is sure just how to handle i think um-hum you know i think personally i'm for it there's several reason why i i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing they say runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it really it's that high and yes and oh yeah it's very expensive and um um-hum it's not like a normal urinalysis it's very expensive to run them and um oh i didn't realize it was that expensive um-hum i didn't get a raise this year because nobody in our company got a raise um-hum just lucky to have jobs but yet their they spend all the money on drug testing and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing people could have got a raise so see there you know there's different i don't think that that's that i think that's more of a personal view of mine other than a a yes sir we should have drug testing because there's really a problem and i know that but then i have other views to it um-hum i just i didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period and Sam's and Wal-Mart are are um-hum owned by the same people he took one for for uh Wal-Mart for job hiring and then Sam's called him and and he took another one and i you know i don't know why they both uh-huh um-hum right made him do that since it was so close together i can see if um-hum because you know if it's a thousand dollars that's a thousand dollars they wasted their their's might not run a thousand dollars our from what i understanding here at TI they run close to a thousand dollars an employee well maybe they run i don't know you know that's just guessing it maybe they run a lot of other tests or maybe it's under a health um-hum type program that it it it would catch a lot of things i i just can't imagine them screening all these employees paying a thousand dollars to get them uh-huh but no for all the the oh it's  hi um hello basically i wear pants i'm a real pants person and um like when i'm at home since and and i'll say i'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing um i wear a pantsuit most of the time not a pantsuit i guess pants and a shirt and um in the summertime i wear cotton tops cotton top shirts and in the winter i wear uh like sweaters i like sweaters a lot and so i do that but when i go out for meetings uh then i will wear either uh skirts or um a dress and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time but that's basically what i do well i think our tastes are fairly similar similar although i'm i government worker i do tend to i'm um a scientist oh so that technically i suppose i could get away with with extremely casual clothes but for the most port part i don't i wear fairly respectable looking shoes and um-hum right and a pantsuit of sort one sort or another and um i guess dress it up with a with a a very nice black jacket when i have some have visitors or have to give talks well that sounds nice right um it said the seasons do do you change much through the season or no actually i guess this summer i i wore some fairly nice jeans um more than i wore have in previous seasons uh-huh but um no i tend to to use the same things because actually our offices are very cold in summer i don't know whether they think by you know freezing them up overnight then they can save electricity during the day or something but but you know you wear a heavy sweater in your office all summer so maybe i don't know right um yeah i don't i don't i you know i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends uh-huh and i guess although in as i recall the stereotype of of secretaries was you know overdress overkill sort of and yeah yeah in a sense uh in a sense the people i know who spend the most on clothes are secretaries although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public right it i find it a little bit strange that their priorities would would be to spend this money here you know i mean i suppose if you were a a more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake perhaps you would have to dress up uh-huh then maybe yeah um well i don't have the resources to just go out and buy buy buy anyway and so my note change dramatically over the years if i need something new i will go and buy it but basically i'm a a pretty much the same in the summertime i wear the light cotton and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters um-hum um-hum and so it's not a whole lot of of change for me either right and um especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses i i i enjoy that but it just wouldn't be um smart for me to do that in my home with my children um-hum um-hum so i have to um think about things like that too i have given seminars before in in creative writing and things like that now i don't know if they consider that a job i don't really get paid for that uh often but uh when i do that then i i think i become more businesslike um-hum um but it doesn't really change in my clothing style exactly i mean you can look businesslike in in a pantsuit uh the same pant suit you would you know wear for other things yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm really glad about that pantsuits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics oh and so i used to have a problem when when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college and had to dress up and nylons and things like that would just give me a terrible rash uh-huh oh dear so that's not helpful right right but otherwise now i'm i i guess we're both pretty practical yeah i guess so well it's been great talking to you have a great day bye okay well have a good day bye-bye  okay did um all i the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no or i'm sorry is all total control uh-huh and then ten as being no control is that what it was oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth i think for control okay so that would be like less control oh no um i i'm confused but i don't really think it matters but okay more control okay and why is that more on the uh higher end yeah oh well for one i think criminals um um-hum they uh i mean i'm all for people you know hunting and doing their thing although i don't hunt personally um-hum um-hum i don't either i don't uh i don't own any guns but um you know i mean i've i've shot gun plenty of guns uh target practice um-hum huh and um well i mean i've kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with boyfriends but uh um-hum gosh i've never done that it's it's fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon uh-huh and uh but the thing i'm concerned about is you know those people you know like a seven day delay is not gonna hurt those people it's no big thing um you know because it's it's uh-huh um-hum you know recreation whereas the people who are going out to um you know for crime um-hum um-hum you know to rob somebody now i think that's good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it um-hum where it's a like cool down if they're just like in the bad uh-huh i agree um that's why i'm i guess i'm like five oh yeah it's for everybody's safety uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too in the middle because because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day oh well i didn't think about that you know for to help be protected tomorrow or whatever that night yeah but i wouldn't want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says i'm gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so it's like a double-edged sword i guess um-hum yeah yeah it definitely is i didn't think about the other side huh so hm hm but i've never i don't know if i've ever shot a gun i don't hm well i served in the service so you have to oh you have to that's neat you have to uh shoot a weapon and qualify otherwise you don't pass um-hum huh so to speak and uh so we had to zero it you know to your own eye each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye and how you look at the sights um-hum um-hum and um who but you wanted like slightly more rules like um like you're towards the conservative end oh well i'm kind of fifty fifty you know if you know hearing your argument it got i'm just right smack in the middle um-hum um-hum i was just wondering because like since i've never shot one maybe it's different if you've actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one oh well you well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you can't just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within let's say a foot foot range uh-huh uh-huh um-hum i mean uh i don't know half a foot to a foot off huh um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight as compared to somebody else um-hum hm what kind of hunting have you done oh uh that was uh i i think we just for small but it was quail i think hm i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like deer or rabbits or squirrels hm um-hum but uh hm because like i have friends that hunt and um but they're like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they don't have like a injured animal running around and um-hum um-hum oh well here uh actually about thirty minutes away there was a guy that fired and the bullet actually went through the deer and then hit somebody and killed them hm oh my God so it hit two different targets um and does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or i don't know it's i'm surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um it it compresses you know it loses it's shape hm um-hum but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and they've had several instance right here in Raleigh and it was national news oh my gosh hm and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh one woman was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the guy thought it was the tail of the uh deer um-hum um-hum um-hum oh my God and shot her did she die or uh i think so yeah there was two or three killings like right one was a school teacher and of course all the school kids uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh hm um-hum um-hum um-hum hm you know it's it hit pretty close to home i guess gosh i'd uh wouldn't wanna live near a forest i know i wouldn't even wanna go hiking you know with people out there hunting uh-huh really are you still in the service or no and  does tend to get talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how they're collected is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments well i think i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right but we don't have that anymore do we i no not uh not near to the extent that it was i didn't think so they've even cut you know who can have an IRA right that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now they've cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair right i usually use that as a preface to you know it's okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive good incentive but since they're not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way but they already tax us i mean where we live it's eight almost eight and a half percent tax people well right but couldn't they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make oh and then some and then some and then some so then you'd have a tendency to be taxing uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year you'd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldn't tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing are you talking about doing away with income tax doing away with everything except for yeah all forms all forms of it including i don't think well we're already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i don't think that would generate enough money well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent oh i see what you're saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um yeah so if you took the money out of one off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that don't report income now so if they don't report income then you wouldn't get that percentage well if they're not reporting the income now they're still not paying it so what's the point if if well if if it's left in the hands of the grocer he doesn't care whether you know this guy giving him the money you know pays taxes or not but he's going to have to pay that percentage see what i'm saying no well when a guy comes in to you know he's got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries um-hum he pays fifteen percent tax let's say right and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax right so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it right and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased because the grocer doesn't want to hide it for him whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and it's up to the government to prove him wrong oh i see what you're saying but if we had to have an income tax which they're never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay see so i'm saying there's what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPA's and right right H&R Blocks would be out of of a job but uh so you you tax yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah that's a rational way to do it yeah i never have understood why they don't do that yeah it it does seem and no one can explain it to me it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they they had some good ideas but they don't seem to be following them anymore no no so i don't know i i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks that's true that's true not being an economy major i guess they'd never ask me anyway they don't ask me at all oh i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they don't pay anything right and i question their i i i just think that they've made it almost a joke all the deductions in the the way you can send  so you just got through painting your living room yeah and what color did you paint it it's kind of white and then we have a peach border and then there's um there's wall paper on the bottom part uh-huh so hm that sounds neat have you done any so did y'all have any problems or or you know did it go pretty fast actually it took a long time because we had to rip off the wall paper first and then um wash down the um like there was all the sticky glue stuff on still uh-huh how'd you get that off just with water oh really yeah but it took a long time to do that uh-huh and then the painting took a while too so uh-huh did all of y'all get in there and get your hands dirty yeap we did it what is it do you what do you usually paint the inside with enamel or latex or what's that what what  TV show uh probably LA Law huh why uh i don't know i like all the court cases and uh the romance between everybody uh what about you um-hum i like silly ones compared to now i like um Perfect Strangers oh okay my fiance likes that you seen that who oh your fiance yeah and um i like that show with Urkel i forget what yeah she likes that too we always have to tape all those on Fridays uh-huh all those uh-huh yeah and um i like those all those video shows they have now oh yeah America's Favorite Home Videos yeah on Sundays uh-huh anything like that i like what else do you like yeah that's all right i like The Price is Right too but i never get a chance to watch it oh you don't get to watch it no huh-uh uh-huh yeah i'm always gone at eleven so you have to tape it or something yeah or i just miss it huh yeah i used to watch it all the time though i never missed it huh do you ever watch uh Sunday Comics no i never heard of that oh wait is that on like at nine or ten or something yeah yeah i've watched that before it's all right um i think it's on Fox um-hum uh-huh it's funny there's this um black comedian George Wallace that makes a joke about The Price is Right you know oh okay i never seen that uh i don't know if you've ever heard that joke he's like uh he said that show is prejudice because they have like the dumbest hugest black women on that show and they run down and they're like and its just funny you just have to see him because he's like grabbing himself and oh so i'll have to watch it tonight uh-huh it's funny and um i i guess i just like funny shows mostly yeah i usually have the TV on just for background noise all the time uh-huh me too yeah i don't i don't think it's ever off uh-huh i have it on right now CHiPs is on yeah i just turned it off when the phone rang oh um um you like soap operas at all or no i can't stand those uh-huh me neither do oh wow that's that's odd two people actually don't like them uh-huh huh yeah i think they're the stupidest shows um-hum yeah and um i guess i like like Twenty Twenty and any kind of yeah those all right Sixty Minutes is okay um-hum documentaries because i teach oh really and lots of times i can tape them and use them for school oh that's a good idea so television's actually useful uh-huh uh-huh yeah it seems like we have cable and there's never anything on we just have more of nothing i can't afford cable oh it comes with our apartment so you're not the huh huh so do you live in Dallas or are you from Dallas no huh-uh where you are from i'm in Pennsylvania okay because yesterday i got somebody in North Carolina oh and um before then i think everybody was in Dallas hm so hm no we have to have cable because we're up in the mountains and you can't get anything oh huh that's interesting but there's nothing on TV ever hardly huh because we have about a zillion channels here in Dallas oh we we can't get anything we can get like one hm without it God that stinks is it like a rip off or cable or not not is it reasonable or it's all right i don't think it's that bad hm but there's never anything on um-hum it's just background noise again hm my mom's from Pennsylvania oh um-hum what part can you um-hum right in the middle yeah Center County hm yeah we don't have any TV stations in this city so they're all from other cities become um-hum hm well yeah i guess we watch a lot of CNN too huh that's the news station yeah but it always repeats like every half hour so we watch the same thing every half hour uh-huh that's like Good Morning America i think if you watch it long enough i think they repeat at least like the headlines yeah yeah and yeah after like an hour or so you just watch everything again and again and again so um-hum well at least you know the news real well yeah and people think are impressed by wow how do you know all this stuff yeah then you get sick of watching like man not this story again you don't pay attention to anything huh uh-huh huh um trying to think of some other shows do you like The Three Stooges no i like Laurel and Hardy though really because a lot of guys like The Three Stooges and they drive me crazy yeah i never got into them much huh i know how about cartoons do you like to watch cartoons yeah i like the Road Runner cartoons uh-huh uh-huh yeah my sister loves anything like that Bugs Bunny or yeah they're not on that often though hm and um least not around here hm i like uh i used to like Pee Wee Herman before they took it off yeah i guess no one will be watching that anymore Pee Wee's Playhouse uh-huh well they said he might do something else now like branch off a different way like maybe more adult humor or something yeah that's what he started doing anyway yeah uh-huh i like that stuff i mean he was always a pervert you know it didn't surprise me when he got caught you know doing that yeah yeah i wasn't too surprised either didn't look like him though uh-huh yep all the pictures yeah i've seen that show twice and it was the same one both times huh i guess i never will see it anymore yeah because they're repeats now or they were repeats before they took them off yeah yeah  something that i guess some people abuse a lot they tend to get let it sneak up on them and get a little bit of money out there on them we didn't uh get too much built up on it that we didn't know it was out there but we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable uh line of credit at our credit union and uh used that as a when the interest rate dropped below what the cards were as a way of paying it off uh which which now almost any source of money is lower than a a interest rate on a credit card right yeah it's it's strange that that i guess to draw new customers i've seen a few banks in this area have uh oh i guess it was like thirteen point nine or so or some of them were even twelve nine i can't imagine how they made that up made that difference up unless they had a quite a fee on it or some sort of restrictions or every transactions fees or something because that was back when you know eighteen and nineteen and twenty one was prevalent yeah but if you think about it now with what what what interest rates are doing i mean they are so low and yet the majority of the credit card companies still have you know eighteen percent some of them even higher right and uh uh you know it it's some of them are almost uh usurious so the last card i got in the last week i got an application for one that was similar to the Discover only it was a gold Visa that offered one percent of your all your purchases back but they had a uh a user's fee of like oh it was thirty five or forty five dollars a year and there was one of the other things they said was so good about the card was that there was no transaction fee if you use it at a uh a different teller than the ones that are at the bank that issues it which of course is an out of state one so that would have been kind of all of mine would have been but the credit union uh right that we're with does charge you if you happen to use outside their's but that's there's so many of theirs that it doesn't matter i i hardly i never have that i know of yeah it's like my uh ATM card if i use it at at my bank which uh i bank at my office and it's down in the lobby i've got a these automatic teller machines then it's very convenient i do probably ninety ninety five percent of my uh cash withdrawals there um-hum but uh as of my last uh uh bank statement i had gotten some cash uh from another location and they charged me two dollars yep for that transaction which i thought gosh and if you happen to check your balance at the same time it would be two more dollars at least that's that's something huh yeah yeah the uh the way the Metroplex is laid out i drive by nine other sites before i get to the one i work at and so there's there's several opportunities to use the uh card there and i happen to be less than a mile from one site and it's real convenient just to run up and get cash fact it's the closest automatic teller there is and it just happened to be the one that uh i'm with so that's nice to have those around and i only drive ten miles to work so it's kind of a uh one of those situations where they're they're all around me as it were i just happen to be in the right straight line between them yeah do you have uh do you ever use your credit cards for cash i have done that once and i did it uh gosh i forget why i i guess i i don't know whether i was trying to consolidate something at that time or some reason i took out a thousand on one card and it wasn't too bad it wasn't but uh one percent or so it was one of the MasterCards i had yeah that's well that's that's not a bad deal i to i had uh a card one time that when you know one of these things without my asking they uh sent me a a package you know notifying me that i was such a value a valued customer that they had uh uh put forth this line of credit for me hum and uh uh you know without reading the small print i found out it was some pretty expensive money before it was all over with because whenever you accessed it through the card uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive yeah i guess that's the way they planned on doing it i can't imagine what i it's been several years i can't imagine what i did to uh i do seem to recall uh oh i i know what it was there was something i needed to do something i needed to buy either a uh gosh i don't know what it i don't think it was a thousand now that i think about it it must have been less than that but something i needed and all the other places places were closed it was after hours as it were and there was a little branch office of a bank that was immediately behind our housing development and they were open  do you have any hobbies yes i do what are yours china painting and ceramics ooh how great i enjoy it um-hum oh uh ceramic painting i enjoy the china more the china more and now that i have my eyes corrected to the point that i can see the delicate part of china painting i do enjoy it how did you ever get into that that sounds so interesting my husband kept begging me and he's been dead now for twenty years so you understand that this was a long time ago but he finally brought me the china the book the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons how marvelous i and i said i'll do it for three months and if i don't like it that's it well i painted an awful lot until his death which was several years and it has just been the most relaxing enjoyable self satisfying thing i've had i now do you do it just for yourself or do you do it to give as gifts or do you actually sell it i have sold quite a bit i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it um-hum oh that sounds marvelous now do you work outside of the home i have just retired you've just retired oh the oh what a great hobby i yes no it's not it's a great hobby but don't retire oh it's uh don't retire well see i don't i never uh returned to work for the past i have stayed home for about the last nine years oh have you well we've transferred around and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake uh on Lake Erie so the lake life appealed to me and my husband's working and he left it up to me if i worked or not wow so in my spare time i love to sew there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing but i do make all my own clothes and we recently purchased a new home so i enjoy doing my uh toppers for my window applications oh i see oh um-hum and things like that but uh just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby yours sounds great well if my sister is the seamstress of the two of us and but she doesn't china paint so we both have our expertise sided that is excellent um what part of Ohio are you in we're in the suburb i'm in the suburb of Cleveland and i'm about um fifteen miles probably from downtown Cleveland something like that and Cleveland is located right on Lake Erie and prior to this we were fifty miles west from here so we were right on the lake yep yes and Cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard and you do find people uh into the crafts and the things that uh various things for spare time but i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting and i'm just intrigued with it well if you ever start be sure and start with a large piece that you can i mean a large flat plate hm that way you can get the feel of you're not cramped on these smaller objects right where you're getting into the delicate work now do you where where did you first get your lessons from that's right in Abilene Texas through a uh an adult ed or uh strictly a china type uh she just taught china painting um-hum and oh how marvelous and when then we had so much fun there i had a friend from Albany which is about thirty six miles away and we would meet every Thursday morning at our instructor's home because she did our firing for us and she would help us and we bought lots of equipment from her supplies and it was just such a delightful time oh and it's so nice it must be so nice for you now that you're retired and then after i beg pardon i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband's death so i have put it aside for a little while but i'm i have just found me an instructor to get started again um-hum oh isn't that great and you'll probably really uh regain regain your enthusiasm for it once you get into a a class again oh i know of course i just have one beautiful peonies with peonies uh umbrella stand and i have two daughters and they're both  well we're gonna be talking about vacations i guess huh where have you been recently right right i have been well i go quite a bit i travel about forty percent of my time but my vacations my favorite spot is Las Vegas yeah Las Vegas well my dad goes there but i am not a betting man i've been there one time and i'll be honest i did not enjoy it no no really i are there any particular reason you're not into gambling or i i guess just because i'm not that type of a person i'm i'm a CPA and i i'm very conservative with my money and i just did to me that was not a vacation i see uh i now i'm a big world traveler i enjoy traveling the world i just got back from Hawaii uh this past July uh the prior year before that i'd been to uh Tokyo Disneyland uh i've been i've got a trip coming up next year i'm going to the EuroDisney oh really in France uh that's gonna be in Paris France we're going there in July yes uh-huh and at the same time we're also gonna go visit Norway i've always wanted to go see the Fjords of Norway i just love have have have you ever been on a cruise to um Alaska um-hum no uh my in-laws have and i i stay stay steer away from boats as much as possible only because i can't take it okay well i tell you what if i possibly can uh there's a spot that i would love to encourage you to go visit really my father same way he had absolutely no desire to be around a boat he says man i get seasick i don't like it um-hum the thing that is so wonderful about the Alaskan cruise it is on what they call the inside passage right right exactly you're not in the ocean you are in a river almost um-hum only only the only thing you have are cliffs on the left and cliffs on the right side and we're talking about five hundred foot thousand foot cliffs absolutely gorgeous and i yes everything i see that they brought back it i i definitely agree and and and and every yeah and every thirty yards here comes another uh waterfall which is nothing more than the melting snow um-hum that's just more glorious than the last one it is absolutely fantastic and with those cliffs the sunsets are just oh my goodness uh for me and my wife it was probably the most romantic one week trip i have ever ever taken really and the food the food on we were on uh Princess Cruise Lines and the food was just out of this world oh yes yes i it's it cruises from what i understand are are really the way to go and someday someday i will convince my or convince myself that i can handle it and i will surprise my wife and and book a cruise uh i much definitely prefer warmer climates than Alaska so i would probably head for the Caribbean well if that be the case i was gonna say you can go to the Caribbean but the now the problem with the Caribbean though now you've got the ocean and i've been to the Caribbean three times now you got the ocean and if you have a motion sickness problem now they have these little patches you can put behind your ear um-hum i've used those right uh you'd wanna use those but the same time though you you're not going to get as pleasant of a ride as you would on that Alaskan cruise um-hum interesting interesting i never i really never thought of that that's pretty good to know uh but and and and there there are parts especially when you get close to Cuba there are the water can get very very rough um-hum yeah really can but uh otherwise as far as vacation i've i've course i see i guess i like the cold weather i i've been up to New England and i thought that was fantastic yeah and this is one spot you know being in Ohio the New England states are not that far uh that is one thing that really has not interested us we do like the Virginias the Carolinas Carolina um now oh have you have you been on the Blue Ridge Parkway oh wow now that's fantastic oh yes several times yeah and uh we next week we're leaving for New Orleans and i'm i i do prefer the warmer the warmer see i'm a Louisiana boy so i know where you're talking about there um-hum but uh and i loved Hawaii yes now that was my first trip i've ever been to Hawaii yes uh we had bought really it it's it's uh it's just beautiful i just i would be very happy staying in Hawaii and becoming a beachcomber when i retire which isn't too far off which is something i might wanna consider but uh well stay away from the Texas coastlines Texas doesn't have anything for you i you know i've i've been tempted i've gotten down as far as San Antonio but i've never gone down to uh really to the coastline yeah the the coastline yeah the coastline here is the pits uh there's there's much better in Florida much much better uh other places Hawaii was wonderful that was great yeah so uh-huh i love it yes i that uh i thought Waikiki Beach was as nice of a of a beach as i ever wanna see and we went to four different islands we had a great time um-hum yes it is and you have to do that uh people that go and they only go to one area you have to see it all well tell you what i've got a i've got a phone ringing on the other line i better go answer it i've enjoyed talking to you though catch you later bye-bye yes very good well it's nice talking to you okay um-hum bye-bye  well basically uh did you wanna go first then uh well i can i i don't own my home um okay right so i mean i i live in a nice area and i rent my home and uh we aren't sure we're gonna buy a house yet because we don't know if we're gonna be staying here um-hum sure uh-huh in uh Texas so yeah i think as far as like our home is uh in a small residential area and we're out of the cities quite a ways so it's kind of more of a country setting and uh it's just a typical um three bedroom type of home it's it's nothing you know elaborate where it has uh this or this or you know it's it's just a typical home with uh three bedrooms uh two story type home and um um-hum and i think as far as if it if we're put it into standards of uh what other homes are around here it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are um there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes and yet there's where we can view the river from that distance there's still homes within our area that are you know pretty typical of what our home is so it's uh pretty much that uh type of um home so um-hum yeah well our home our house we we're renting it from an individual who bought it and he lives in Korea and and uh he's recently moved here and he's owns eight or nine properties uh uh-huh oh really hm sure uh near here and uh so but the houses around here there's five five houses on my street for sale right now uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah which is just uh incredible incredible to me and they're not very expensive either it just seems like we we have a three bedroom house ours is one level only um but we yeah um-hum so it's a rambler style yeah we have two two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen and the bedrooms are a little bit small except the master bedroom's a little bigger so um-hum yeah yeah it's kind of like what ours is uh our one of our bedrooms is really small and we've made that into a den because we only have one child so that was our best way of going with uh the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller it seems like they get incredibly small um but uh yeah anyway but okay that sounds great and uh i don't know if we need to talk anymore or whatever have you done have you done this before the TI um yes uh about three times and so i'm fairly new to it but it seems to be going okay uh-huh oh have you yeah are you in Texas no yeah no huh-uh no i'm out of state i'm in Wisconsin so yeah yeah so its oh really oh um other than that sure yeah is this your first time sounds interesting no huh-uh i've oh i've gotten several calls um but uh uh-huh i'm the always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it's like i can get it done with i don't have to wait until somebody called me even though i have a feeling what's gonna happen is i'll probably get tons of calls you know so yeah sooner or later yeah yeah well they've i've talked to some people from Cleveland and i did talk to someone else who lives here uh in the same city i do so that was kind of interesting uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah sure they're they're sure getting their people out so well it was nice to talk to you anyway and okay thanks bye-bye yes okay well you take it easy Gail um-hum bye now  all right this is easy for me since i and me too because i eat out a lot yeah well i travel i do about forty percent of my time is on the road so you eat all your meals out i eat a lot of meals out um well i'm also married my wife is A1 cook but she enjoys eating out so i have to share it with her and uh actually it's very easy for me because i i have a practice make it a practice when i am out i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here sure so so i look for just about anything and it's it's uh it's a lot of fun i don't have to worry really worry too much about price considerations because i you know i was gonna ask you could you go to you know nice places and oh sure yeah and it's it's really great i i i like different types of food so where are your places what what are places you you know memorable places you've eaten uh oh you name okay you name it let's see you've got one down in uh down near uh Addison um there's two restaurants that i particularly like that i eat every time i get into Texas or i get into Atlanta Georgia i make sure i go and that's Houston's oh Houston's uh-huh yep okay it's a great place it's it's great there's a a restaurant in um right outside of Reading Pennsylvania it's called Alfredo's um-hum that does not look like a restaurant that you would really wanna recommend to a lot of people but it is fabulous fantastic uh there's a restaurant and i don't recall the name of it uh in uh Panama City of course not too people wanna rush back to Panama City uh Panama the country Panama oh okay because i was thinking well i i grew up in Panama City i get it okay no this is the country this is the country Panama all right right and uh but i have gotten to quite a few and i go to Canada and get quite a few restaurants up there i you know and i know the locations and i know the places but i lot of times i don't remember the names i'd have to go back through some expense reports um-hum but particularly in down in your area i'm looking for some some more restaurants so i you know i don't know what's what's down there other the ones in Addison do you like Mexican do you like Mexican food oh not particularly that's one of the few why which one were you gonna recommend well i mean there's so many places here you know they're just it's just lots of good Mexican restaurants here uh-huh uh-huh but in the Addison well about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area anyway right i mean now there's a new Italian place called Sfuzzi okay i have a that has a great i've not been there but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas and now there's one in Addison okay let i'm i'm writing it down it's F S it's S F U Z I okay and it's on it's in Addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have like Cajun food is Copeland's i've been there oh i really like Copeland's okay i've been there um one down there is the uh i think it's an old schoolhouse uh oh the yeah the i know no i don't like that place well i like the food but i don't care for the clowning around see uh uh yeah actually actually when i went i thought the food was not good oh really Magic Time Machine is the place you're thinking of oh i've had i that's it that's it i've had excellent food there see i when i went i thought the people drove me crazy first of all but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was true true uh-huh yeah all right well that's great uh no Italian that's fine i'm i make it a habit of always going out to Pasta Oggi's um-hum which is right down there in Addison do you like like Southwestern oh yeah well now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill all right that's on Beltline that's close to Houston's a matter of fact and um really it's great i mean they're they have i think sometimes i've been when i thought well it wasn't as good but i went there recently and i thought well this really is good um-hum so that's that's a very good place to eat The Blue Mesa Grill good and um well this is great this is gonna give me a some more places to go okay fine a whole new dining experience i guess our time's about up so well they haven't beeped us have they uh well they don't always oh i thought sometimes they say you know this is three minutes or whatever yeah i they've been doing that when uh the circuits are busy okay and uh other than that they you know leave you go about five minutes and then that that's about it i guess that's what they need for their machines to get everything down pat so okay well thanks for calling for helping us out bye-bye it was a pleasure talking you okay you bet bye-bye  how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home so it well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore he actually died a few months after that and so uh-huh as at least in retrospect it was the right thing to do because he it was either you know a nursing home or a hospital or something else that he would have been spending most of his time in those days right and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him um well the see uh well we he wanted to get into a Mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list oh my right we wound up just choosing a another Mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into or we no actually no it was even Mennonite related i'm sorry it was actually not a particularly great nursing home mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it because he suddenly got sick and needed to be put in yeah so the convenience right uh what do you think my grandmother lived with us um until August um and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home she has leukemia um-hum and her the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in Dayton and were several thousand miles away yeah so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and TV set so yeah yeah that's important i'd say yes and that the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days and would have to be hospitalized a day or two so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room okay so she didn't have to be transported back and forth so she's been there since August the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well it's not her favorite place to be in she'd much rather be here with me but yeah when it got to the point i was spending more time at the hospital with her and i've got little children here who needed me here right so that um she needed somebody to watch her twenty four hours a day right and that becomes difficult then so she was falling down and hemorrhaging and you know all kinds of physical problems so it just became too much for me to handle even though i would have liked to have had her stay with her health being what it was she couldn't anymore um-hum yep we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life but he was essentially too proud and too independent so that even though his heart was yeah getting incredibly weak and his knees were going bad he uh-huh lived in his own house as long as he could though he was living alone yeah had an upstairs apartment could barely make it up the steps to the uh top without a great deal of pain oh and this eventually things just went too far and he yeah he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home yes well i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age other people have to kind of help them make decisions it sure wouldn't have been Granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home but she's accepted it real well now right well that's so yeah that's right that the children have some responsibility too to their parents and such to help decide what's the right thing well we enjoyed having her here but we feel she's much safer where she is now she still continues to fall but when she does there a nurse is right there to help her and um-hum and i know she's eating the right things and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her so it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair yep so i think she'll adjust  so have you done any painting projects lately yeah this is a great topic for me because i just did my first two painting projects ever it was not not a big deal oh really what kind of painting was it two little deals the first one um i helped someone repaint an apartment and it was very easy uh-huh it was it yeah and i've never painted anything i always thought it would be so you know you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something but i know i can do it and the second one was i bought some toys at a um yeah oh huh at a craft fair they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a a little girl for Christmas and so i just decided to paint them and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment was uh-huh oh well what kind of paint did you use for the um bookends well it's uh it that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't it was a oil base so i had to get and when i painted them i didn't realize that we didn't have any uh turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house so i had it had it all over my hands at first i didn't realize you know i had never painted anything so i didn't realize that i needed that i mean i kind of knew in the back of my mind uh-huh so you can't use oil on wood well no you can use it on wood but i just had it all over my hands and i went to wash the brushes out and uh wash my hands and you can't wash it off with water you have to get the uh a solution oh so you had to go around with paint all over you temporarily anyway and yeah i had to drive to the store yeah i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy some paint thinner and right back and everything like that and then um oh uh downstairs in the in the apartment i just used we just used a latex base and so you can drip it on you know if you dripped it on something as long as you wiped it up it was real easy to clean up oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex yeah and and it it just like the same with the toys it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it you know it says safe for children and all that hm uh-huh yeah heard about that i guess a friend of mine had a uh um well she she just started up a day care center and uh and the one of the real strict uh restrictions was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff yeah so uh she had that done but uh have you painted anything recently well um so to speak i had to paint this uh the inside of this warehouse thing uh that you keep some um farm equipment in wow was it huge uh-huh and um what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer and uh i had this big five gallon jug and it was like paint thinner i mean i you know it looked just like it was the viscosity of paint thinner yeah but uh you just took a roller and put it on there and uh if you saw that the wood was getting wet you know that was that was all you needed so wow yeah it was it used all of it i guess it was about three hundred yards worth so well i guess it worked out it was pretty easy actually yeah i think though um we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work because i don't know if i could you know i don't know i don't know must be difficult well what about the trim in your house did you have to do that no it was just it was really easy i just like what i we had a couple of different size brushes and it was uh-huh you know real easy i went around the trim and if it and there was wallpaper like i was doing just doing just the trim of the around the doors and windows and there was wallpaper and um-hum if we got it on the wallpaper a little bit we just wipe it right away before it dried it came right off so there was no major mistakes there was oh yeah did you have uh one coat or two uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that um-hum yeah that would be really time a a time saver well yeah if you just you know we didn't tape anything we weren't that careful but it wasn't you know i don't know it's it's funny it's like if you just go slow you don't get or at least i didn't get that many mistakes i didn't make that many mistakes um-hum oh me i would've had to have taped the whole thing and then brushed around the edges and and then i'd have probably rolled it on i'd uh it would've taken me forever why just because you'd be afraid to do it or have you done it before yeah well the first time it'd probably would've tooken me forever so well it wasn't if it was my own i would've but my friend said oh just go ahead you just go ahead it's easy i said okay it's your place well how long did it take y'all well a couple of weekends we would go down two or three hours on the weekends and um-hum so there was two of y'all no there was they were doing all sorts of repairs and there was i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else so there's a whole bunch of people yeah well that's easy enough um so now i feel like if i ever buy a house i can probably paint if nothing else i think i could probably do it uh as long as the hardware store told me what to buy then i could do it yeah but you know i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys and the guy said oh get this it's a nice shiny gloss which was true but i didn't realize what you know a pain it is to clean the brushes and everything if you don't have latex i don't know if it's worth the shine um-hum  hi Clarice um have you had a family reunion recently yes just this last summer we went back to Utah and we met it was my we usually go to my family reunion but this one was my husband's uh-huh and they're usually quite similar i think are you both from Utah originally no he's from here oh uh-huh but um most of his people are from Oregon so we kind of met halfway uh-huh and so this was one and they um planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin and and had you know things like that have to be planned like they had planned that oh how nice we went to the reunion in end of July June and first of July that part the fourth of July weekend but we had to plan everything like clear in December January to reserve that uh-huh uh-huh sure sure now was this his entire family cousins aunts uncles things like that or his immediate family oh wow oh wow how many people were there um-hum no this was everybody oh i oh uh jeez i think over um three hundred were there it was quite a large wow wow it was a great big lodge and so we had plenty of room and everything and and some of them live in that area so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave but um uh-huh that was a great big thing and we do that with his family about every five years a great big one and then like immediate family we do like uh we try to do one thing once a year oh that's wonderful oh now how many how many people are in his immediate family well he has eight brothers and sisters so that's big by itself oh wow wow it really is and you get together once a year wow uh yeah so we have a little shindig with them are they all here in the area or are they scattered uh they're close in a close proximity um uh let's see there are four of them who live here in Texas and his mom and dad uh-huh so um the others live in close neighboring um states like Nevada Arizona i think like that and uh-huh uh-huh oh wow that's wonderful that's wonderful yeah so it's been fun how about you well we don't really get together i i would love to and that's why i checked that i wanted to do that because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime um i have a sister in Colorado and uh a sister in upstate New York and a sister in Connecticut and here i am in Texas so we're kind of scattered right now um-hum and um my my cousins have a you know they put on a family reunion um once a year but it's always like the second week in September so it's the kids are already back in school um-hum that's hard and so and that's back in and that's in New York and there's no way i mean there's just no possible way and it's not really a weekend it's just like a day kind of thing because most of them are still you know um yeah yeah my family moved to Connecticut the rest of the family stayed in New York and uh on Long Island and so they're all kind of local and close and so they just have a you know a day picnic um-hum and uh i've always thought it would be so neat even if it were just my immediate family to have like a weekend type thing yeah that would be so wonderful it really is fun and my mom's family does it once a year just like you said once a year um they have a a uh-huh a Wednesday through a a Saturday type thing you can come and go as you please type thing and they do that once a year i kind of missed it oh wow this year and felt bad but you can't go every year you just cannot do that um yeah yeah yeah and do they they have a hotel or where do you stay um basically they just stay with each other brothers or sisters there are enough in the area to to just kind of span yourself out um whoever's mom and dad it is you usually go and stay with them like i go stay with my mother and take everybody yeah my cousins they just go stay with their mom and dad you know kind of thing and so it's not hard uh-huh uh-huh in in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area so that's not hard but yeah yeah oh that sounds so wonderful isn't that nice the real planning that's the real key and they send out my mom's family now this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with yeah but my mom's family each brother and sister takes a turn one year and that's how they divide it up and then uh-huh from one brother and sister from each family uh she has ten in that family and each one of them take their turn and then the the parent whose turn it is the child whose uh-huh oh wow uh-huh turn it is her children help her like if it was my mother's turn all of us children would help her put it on kind of thing yeah and um the thing is that um um-hum oh i see uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh wow the the real part is there are two mailings that go out and the first one is to just kind of give a an approximate date and time so you can start getting  where have you been on a wonderful vacation well normally when we go on vacation we go home to Colorado oh that's where we go home too really yeah Colorado Springs is where we're from that's where we go how funny yes my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maizeland yes really we live up up uh Lake in the Broadmoor area ah where my family my in-laws are oh we've been there we haven't skied at Broadmoor we went there last year at Christmas time and it was twenty seven below so we had to cancel our ski lessons oh uh-huh as you can't even ski there anymore really yeah they closed it down oh just this year uh-huh they don't have enough money to keep it going it doesn't doesn't pay so oh my ah so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier well yeah and well now i don't know now Colorado Springs is real accessible to like Breckenridge it's only a couple of hours away and uh so it's it might not be too bad if you wanted to go skiing somewhere else but you can't can't ski up there any more so uh-huh no oh uh i'd like to go on vacation i can't my husband and i wanna go to Florida to go to Disney World but we have two little ones that are under two right now so we wanna wait until they're a little bit older to do that and uh uh-huh yes oh well we went on a family cruise last year on the Premier Family Cruise Line and then we went to Disney it was all part of the package oh and on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck and it was really oriented toward little kids well how fun so the kids could eat with Chip and Dale you know and you know it's just a lot of fun oh yeah oh i bet so then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas and then landed at Cape Canaveral and then drove over to Orlando and spent four days at Disney wow well that sounds pretty neat yes that was the way to travel yeah that sounds pretty good and it was all a big package deal where you just pay one price and get everything yes yes that's right that's right and kids are really cheaper too really we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise so they said we could either cancel reschedule or take whatever was available so we took whatever was available and we left a day early and they put us up at the Cocoa Beach Hilton and the ship that was available the only uh rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites wow so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin oh what a deal yeah so then our cruise was actually extended a day and our Disney was extended a day so we turned a seven day trip into ten great and they paid for everything well that's great oh yes so that was a wonderful vacation yeah i bet uh that sounds like the way i'd wanna do it i think yes well what kind of things do you like to do when you go to Colorado oh well we like to ski of course so we spend so much time with our families uh and seeing our friends because we moved to Texas about two years ago yes so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do so we don't we don't get a lot of time to just vacation we did um last year though go to San Antonio for Memorial Day yeah oh which was fun just to get to kind of walk around and see the sights down there and do that kind of thing uh-huh uh but you know other other than that with with both my kids being under two it's real hard to do any any kind of right that would be events that that uh don't require babysitting yes i know i think one of the places i always hit in Colorado is that current outlet store yeah that's funny you should funny you should mention that i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it that's what oh with the Santa Claus on the cover yes i've already ordered from that one but we will probably be going up at Thanksgiving this year so uh-huh oh do you live where do you what state are you in Texas oh you're in Texas yes i'm in the Dallas area so am i in Plano i'm in Garland yeah uh so that's not too far i talked to somebody from Wisconsin or something the other day yeah so i guess they get people from all over yeah driving for Thanksgiving that's going to be quite a drive for oh yes well it was when we left last year we left on the eighteenth right before that big snow storm hit Colorado and we pulled in just as it hit uh-huh wow so how do you go do you go up through the Raton Pass when you go up there uh no Raton uh oh well wait a minute yeah we do we do do you that's on like Route 287 or something like that yeah um-hum and then we go straight up through Trinidad and straight up I-25 from there okay okay we uh went a different way when we went last Christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little U-Haul trailer because we had to take our dog in the car there was no room for luggage so we went all interstate we went up um through Oklahoma City uh-huh and then up through uh Kansas and then turned left and went in on I-70 oh and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour it was a little more mile wise uh-huh but because you could go sixty five miles an hour on the  now then i think that are you there all right do you have any one that has been in a nursing home uh-huh yeah i'm here uh well uh we may um my grandmother before very short time um she uh she was just more or less in a in a nursing home for uh recovery from a broken hip oh because she could receive more medical attention but um that physical therapy was there and whatever but i think in visiting her there yes um it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in uh weren't there mentally uh she was probably the only person in the um whole nursing home that uh still had all of her mental facilities about her so that was uh that was very disheartening well what do you think can be done about that i mean what can we do oh yeah it's really hard i guess i i come from a family of um of uh take care of your elders i I guess um my my dad's mother is an invalid and she lives with my aunt and uncle and they care for her you know all around the clock though she's not uh she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention she because of arthritis she's just unable to get out of bed so i guess you know there's that family commitment um i know that my parents my mother's trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can um well i can remember of course i'm old enough to remember when the family or the church took care of all of this yeah right yeah we did not have to call on on someone else and i feel no you tell me how you feel about yeah well probably i think as long as the person's able to um to understand what's going on around them and i think you know my grandmother right now still able to walk around and she's still able to um to do some things for herself though she gets Meals On Wheels which i think is a great thing because um yeah it saves people from having to prepare her food for her because you worry a little bit about her leaving a stove on or whatever though she does most things very well it still makes a little bit easier for her certainly did i worked with an agency in West Texas that hum-um they it's where they really started this concept of Meals On Wheels uh-huh and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly if they didn't have to you know go into a kitchen um-hum right my mother hexpired just just a little over a year ago and we had finally she didn't wanna live with either my sister or me um-hum but we be got found a retirement center for her and it was beautiful and they had all these they didn't even have nursing care there so until as long as mother was you know mobile and got her food and she was with people with whom she enjoyed um-hum right yeah that i think you know it's really funny i have two grandmothers still alive and my my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible she's like openly told people she's always been very good about knowing yes she's eighty nine and she said that she really would like to stay in her house as long as possible because it's her home sure but when the time comes um she and she can't do things and she has to be cared for or whatever she would prefer and she's actually said this to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment uh probably with like a living space and a bedroom with maybe a kitchenette yes sir so that if she you know if she wants to fix herself something light she can do that but if she wants to go to a meal she can go down the hallway uh to a room where there's a cafeteria and there's other people there and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company yeah being a widow i find that eating alone is one of the hardest things i have to do um-hum yes um-hum i have just recently retired and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to right so uh mother had the little kitchenette and she could do all these fine things that she just um-hum had had a microwave had to pop her popcorn now this is wonderful but when it came time for a full meal right um-hum then mother was able to go with people and and enjoy it right yeah i think i think that probably until invalids until they're really invalids elderly the elderly are invalids i think that they should be able to interact with other people in in an environment that they choose if they can if the family can afford it i think um and see i know that oh i think so too well my grandmother would like to stay in her house and my parents actually said you know that they may have to take their end sometime so because you know my grandma actually says who she wants to live with she's pretty you know she lets people know so  go ahead what do you have to say on the subject well i am a tax preparer myself so i do about five hundred income taxes a year in fact i even do television and radio shows here in the Dallas market uh regarding income taxes make sure every one pays the right amount and i am convinced that uh most people try to hum-um cheat ever so slightly on their tax returns only because uh the way the IRS does things they're not gonna give you any breaks i mean they they encourage you to cheat because if you should get audited they're gonna get you for everything and and some more on top of that and then they're gonna tax you on that for or they're gonna give you an interest on it i know somebody that it happened to that that's right no see believe it or not i'm one of these honest guys but i get to the point that last year we took a transfer and so therefore we had the boost in the income due to the transfer expenses when i sat down when we were through and i sat down with our accountant and we did it if i'm not presently working outside of the home if i return to work believe it or not with our state income tax our city income tax city we live in and city we work in i would have lost and with social security i would have lost forty eight cents on every dollar that i earned easily easily and well easily just as you said and i sat down and thought about it and i should be in a pretty good position because i don't have little kids any more that i need sitters for or anything like that if i go to work it would be for our fun money and we realized that how it would distrupt disrupt our travel routine and things like that and my husband gets five weeks vacation and we said it's not worth it i'm not working any more yep it just isn't worth it and you get frustrated and yet i don't know what the Texas uh the Texas rules are well see well Texas we are a community property state so we have some a little bit different rules than you have in the separate property state such as uh where you in Ohio but do you pay a state income income tax we we do not have state income taxes yet but we see it on the horizon it hadn't hit here yet but we do have you don't um they start with one percent and then they get you every two year yeah but how much do you pay in sales tax uh sales tax we pay seven percent okay we're at eight and a fourth right now you're so you're higher but you get out-of-towners on that then you get everyone on your state uh sales tax which is good true true true as uh the income tax what's not fair is paying in the city you live in right now we're living where there is a reciprocity so if you do pay more in the city you're working you don't owe your city anything no and this year well my husband's actually keeping track of all his time out of the city of Cleveland so that we can get the difference because our city is a little bit less but are you of the fact that when you prepare your tax return now obviously if you have an error in the IRS's favor they're going to be very quick to come back to you and say hey you owe this much more tax right but if there is an error in your favor they do not come back to you and say oh you get a refund they oh absolutely and much less they don't pay you an interest yeah so you know if what's fair for the goose is good for the gander and unfortunately the IRS is saying you know we have screwed y'all so many times that's why so many tax payers are starting to cheat more and more which is a shame but i think the IRS has brought it on themself because they're not being very helpful to those who have made errors and i think if they would i think if they would come back and say hey look this is wrong this is the way it should be done we're gonna give you some refunds and so forth and actually show an honest effort to be good on both sides of the fence we wanna collect as much tax we also wanna give back as much tax right i i think that you'd have a better feeling and you'd have a lot better tax returns being done well and it is now to the point that it has gotten so um so complicated i can do ours in a normal year i have always done our income tax and i've done it with transfers and sale of property but this last time it was so involved that i just threw it all up and said forget it let's go see a CPA well and yet if you went to visit five different CPA's you'd get five different answers that's what i understand uh this one seemed to do well and uh she did go over our last three or four years and she said i have to compliment you you have excelled she said i cannot find one thing to pull out that you haven't already pulled and i said well i do keep records all year long as i go one on twice a month one on i think uh you sound like one of the type of clients i'd love to have well that's what she said i went in there and i had all my books and i said now what do you want to know and i keep every single thing as i write the checks twice a month i enter it uh in either donations wherever it goes i do keep good records and so therefore this time i did not like having to go to someone else because i said well i've got all everything but  okay well basically my habits are totally gone i used to exercise quite a bit and now i have a child and and um trying to do go to school back to college again so it's okay it's uh exercise is kind of forget it well it but if it well if i remember back to when i had a child they give you a lot of exercise just what age is your child they sure do yeah my daughter yeah yeah uh she's three so three with a i think it's almost like she's got this endless uh-huh energy i mean it's no longer nap time that kind of thing so oh she's given up the naps yes yeah so oh i remember i remember mine doing that that's terrible yeah exactly so the exercise we can pretty much uh get from her uh she always wants to go outside and do things so i'm kind of uh she's an only child too so it's it's not like you can say go out and play with other kids so it's oh right and so many people work nowadays there you know there's not that many kids in a neighborhood necessarily anymore either um-hum sure sure but well my main uh exercise the only one i've ever stuck to at all is walking yeah uh-huh and i try to get out and walk two miles most everyday but but it you know it fluctuates i'll do real good for a while and then i'll be off of it for a while just depending on what's happened but the last uh uh-huh um-hum sure couple of uh years uh my husband is an accountant and he moved his office to the house and i work for him um-hum sure so that helps because we're at home and i can get out and walk a lot better than when i was working in an office sure sure so that has helped but anything else uh well we have a lake house and down there when we go down there some on weekends we get a different type of exercise you know just doing a lot of work and things down there but that and uh and walking is about it yeah yeah that's about what uh basically if we can get out and take a walk it's it's great but uh most of the time we can't so it's uh we're too busy doing other things but that also takes into account of walking though when you think about it so it ah um-hum i will admit though when i do walk i feel so much better you know when i get out and do that two miles it takes about thirty minutes just our neighborhood is just kind of very flat land with sidewalks and oh sure sure uh-huh sure uh i really do uh and and i smoke and i can tell that it just immediately if i've been coughing or something you know it just immediately seems to clear my lungs up uh-huh uh-huh to loosen it up yeah yeah that's true but um so yeah well i got a lot of exercise though the last four or five days i have two grandchildren oh yes three months and nineteen months and my daughter and son-in-law went on a uh-huh trip for three days and left them with us and we nearly went nuts uh-huh so oh boy sure trying to keep up with the nineteen months uh sure they're into everything well and the baby was sick so he wasn't good you know so it took was one on one i mean i had to take one and he had to take the other one and it was busy the baby hm oh he was cranky and they woke up all during the night and i'm not uh used to that sure once you lose that sure that's very true uh-huh it wasn't too long ago where i was doing the same thing and that uh totally gets your mental capabilities uh thrown off totally when they're uh tired and uh you wake up in the middle of the night and it's my daughter used to be pretty much on a regular basis for that so um-hum daddy just came home so the house is starting to liven up here now but uh that's about it that's kind of how my exercise is right now is just basically running after a three year old um um-hum right uh when you were talking about mentally losing sleep it also made me think of one other thing walking so um-hum does for me when i do it it does help me mentally you know if i'm worried about something or whatever and i get out and do that um-hum walk it just i don't know it just sort of helps your mental attitude too it sure does yeah so i miss that when i don't do it sure sure well it was really nice talking to you then but well nice to talk to you okay um-hum thank you um-hum bye now bye bye  um-hum all set actually i'm in Plano too i say Dallas area when i'm talking to people elsewhere that's okay that's okay it it's more uh concentrated so they know where you are yeah um anyway uh i know here in here in Plano some of the things that we do are um Kroger and some of the other stores too have said if you bring your bags back to uh to the store to recycle then they'll pay you a certain amount of money and that's one thing that started in the community they actually pay you money for that hm um Brookshires up in Allen um-hum uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm um-hum yeah i know Kroger will do it and i think Albertson's does it sometimes i'm not sure um and and yet i know that uh some of the stores will actually help the community not pay you the money back but will pay the the uh community like through the schools or things like that um-hum interesting so um that's always helpful and i know that we have we have the the can the can different can banks around the city right that you can go to and do that um one of the ways i don't know uh if this would be helpful it said on the the computer what do i think would be helpful and i don't know if it would be helpful or not but i know on Monday the the garbage men pick up like just um uh any limbs or any extra trash that you might have right and that might be an extra day to put out uh things that might be recycled if we had a a certain colored can to put them in or or something in the city to put like either glass or newspapers or whatever yeah i think they already do that out east um they have to it's a little bit more difficult because people have to remember okay today's glass okay tomorrow's plastic and all that but i think that's the way we need to go it's uh it's pretty bad all these years we've been yeah yeah especially in this country all the uh the plastic and the paper and everything we just used to throw out yeah uh i know getting a newspaper everyday i know i could just you know do that um-hum because i have to pick it up and it just goes out with our trash and i guess i'm not as um recycling minded as i should be but uh that goes out with the trash and it really could be recycled yeah about six months ago i started and yeah and uh so what i do is uh so did you tell me it's not bad you just have to have a place to keep everything but uh it you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it just put your paper in the same place every day and it'll start stacking up take your glass um you know pickle jars or or whatever um uh liquid jars you know and just rinse them out a little bit and put them all in a place and uh plastics um-hum now do you have to take like labels off of those jars no from what i understand uh you can leave the labels on um although i rip rip them off i don't i don't scrub them or anything i just tear them off uh-huh yeah take them off yeah throw the lids and everything out but uh put all the glass in one place and plastics like milk jugs uh orange juice jugs things like that soda both liter sodas can you do that okay yes those also um and then of course uh cans Coke cans whatever right right but uh i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they're taking all that i've just read a lot about it and i'm keeping these big piles of it right now to try to dump it out this weekend in fact but uh you'd be amazed how quickly it all stacks up there's a lot that we throw out i i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just um get it into different categories like that and um-hum i i don't know what it would take to to get my children to start working on it i i have two older ones that probably would go along with the if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project you know it's yeah it's not a big deal you get used to it one let me tell you one interesting thing when i went back to the store and uh okay and i said hey um i understand y'all are taking these bags back uh you know what do you do with them and they had told me they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then you know go and recycle the rest and i said what do you mean the ones that don't belong there yeah and they said well you know people come in and put anything in the receptacles and what i found out is if you look at the bottom of those bags Kroger or whatever the plastic ones they've got numbers on them uh-huh oh yeah and it's it's got the little recycle symbol and inside it it's got a number like um bags from Drug Emporium have a four  uh what is what is your practice as far as budgeting do you manage the money well i we talk about it but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and and tries to somehow make the ends meet which uh oh i see that's how kind i am too are you married you are i think the women for the most part end up managing the money my husband always says he earns it and i have to spend only what he earns it um yes yeah i don't mind the spending it's just that i trying to trying to get what you need out of out of what you have that seems to be our challenge so well i don't work outside of the home and he always threatens that when i spend more than what's coming in i have to go back to work so i i manage i see well i'm i'm at home also so it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary but uh no do you actually follow a budget well we pretty well do um several years we didn't and we found that we just weren't making the most of of what we had and so we we um set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for you know just our bills and then what's left we divvy up we try to save a little bit although we're not always successful and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs well that's pretty much the way we do um or we did in the past i would say what right at this point our children are grown and so i really don't have the obligations there anymore that we have to balance to yeah right you know get things together for them and i really just keep very good records and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that and i try to keep my MasterCards and things paid currently right uh-huh uh i don't always succeed at that i usually keep one with a low interest rate and i'd put things on there that i think i'm not gonna give to right and then i have another one but for the most part our mortgage and our utilities at this point we're in a new home and uh they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to yeah so i'm still getting used to that but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead right and we do not buy used ah new cars uh do you get into the car well we had new cars um always until about four years ago my husband um owned his own company and it went under and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment and now it's just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that that we do have a used car well he has a company car also but for our personal car we have a used car um do you think that it's wiser to buy used we do for us very much so in fact we are in a position that most of our friends why wonder why we just don't go to a new car you know whatever and i said right look you guys are all into car payments we haven't had car payments for so many years i love it this way and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked and it has eighty two thousand miles on it and we were kept saying boy wouldn't it be great if we could find another one just like it uh-huh believe it or not we did we found one one newer the worst part is it's the same color oh no oh wow and so everybody's saying you're kidding you have two cars the same and i said you know how when you have a bad one you say never again that's right i said well we had one and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it and it's an eighty five wow and so i said hey this was a cinch we've paid for the car and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on right this is for all the long running back and forth on you know interstate driving and things and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years or next year probably do you um buy from dealers or from individuals generally from dealers and uh it depends because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual um-hum right uh unless we we have done that when we had a really good one that we wanted to sell you know uh we were going up to a larger one right but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer and we always make a deal i mean we have walked out of more dealerships saying don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us yeah we will you know and they say well you're kidding you know i no this is the price we're going to give you out the door we don't wanna hear about taxes  hello hello hi boy it took forever to find somebody hello hello oh well i'm glad you found me good well i'm my name's Gail and i guess we have to talk about credit cards yes my name is Carolyn okay well if you're ready then uh okay i'll just let you start i'll okay i'll press one okay well i'm not this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me because credit cards are my downfall i just find it so easy to to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it and really trying to get out of that habit so i think they're kind of dangerous i think they are too and unfortunately um we use ours in we don't use them all the time but we use them like at Christmas time and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that but um i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half um-hum yeah me too i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them um that's what gets to be the really scary part you know if you think when it comes around to income tax time and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year you could really get a lot more stuff um-hum if you were just able to pay outright for it yeah that's true that's true seems just like our society is so um pushes so hard for you can have it you know and then no interest no payments for a year and stuff like this they're really trying to get you into that uh situation because they know they've really got you then that's right so yeah all i know is some of my credit cards like um we have a Sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's uh-huh probably four or five hundred dollars you know that goes on at that point and then it seems like uh-huh takes forever to pay that off it's funny that uh we've got a Sears card and we bought a washer and dryer on it four years ago um-hum and we still owe i mean i i think like half of the amount that they cost in the first place wow it's just uh you know you just never never get get it out and uh that's that's real irritating to have it sure is we eventually did one time we just borrowed you know took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards and the interest on the loan was cheaper than it was you know to just have that uh-huh we haven't done it lately we probably need to do it again well we did you know one time we wanted to buy a truck a used truck and so we went down to the bank and they said sure we'll give you a personal loan it was only a thousand dollars that we needed um-hum for the truck and they said sure that's no problem but you know why don't we consolidate your bills and at the time we thought oh that would be great you know we could and it's gonna be a lower payment than it was for all of them you only have to write one check a month not all those you never miss one or whatever and we did that but we didn't realize at the time um-hum uh until several months later that we we were real i mean this was four year three years ago we were pretty young and we were just kind of like well i guess that means these credit cards are closed and we didn't you know about six months later we realized we could use them and so we charged them all up again oh no yeah so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before but also adding the lower payment problem so we were paying like twice oh um so we didn't ever made that mistake again luckily but uh we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing we just as a matter of fact this it's real interesting the subjects i get they always seem to be so pertinent but we just discussed this last night at church talking about debt and things like that i just it's so so alluring and uh so easy to get uh sometimes um-hum i know they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and your car um-hum yeah and uh if you could stick to that you know we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and everything else yeah yep sure that's true oh i just picked up my daughter and she was eating a cupcake and there are crumbs all over her yeah what a mess you are oh dear oh so i don't know if i if i i just feel kind of i my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our Visa card and i just thought you know if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something you know and we had to had to buy one and we would really need that and um-hum so he said okay we'll keep it and then we weren't smart enough to not use it so you know one thing you might do with in a situation like that though it's just like keep now we just don't  i'm Doug hi how you doing Doug my name's Brad where where you from from Pennsylvania oh okay i'm from New York yeah okay so anyway now we're talking about drug testing an all that and you ready okay so what do you think about it right right yep okay oh i definitely i i think it shouldn't be if it may be the only exception is when there's public safety involved you know bus drivers uh train train motormen stuff like that you know right right i agree with you basically so might be a boring conversation but um but anyway i agree that right um only when there's any question of safety does the employer have a right because otherwise i feel that the measure of whether someone is to stay employed or not it is just performance whether you're able to do the job up to par and that and if that can be done it shouldn't matter whatever the employee might do in his private life yes um you're right it's probably is gonna be boring i agree with you a hundred percent okay uh you know but i i i think that uh i mean people think that they have an interest in in finding things like this out about their employers because it's probably and and maybe it's true that that if if you if you tested people and if they were drug users yeah probably i mean i might even agree with you that they're probably gonna to be less productive employees um i'm not sure about that but i would say that that that may be that might be a good indication yeah that well probably at least on the average but but you could also you might be able to tell by a person's uh you know whether they're overweight or underweight uh-huh uh you know you might make certain value judgments about that you can make value judgments probably about about a number of different things that are clearly within the realm of someone's private ability yeah you know private you know private interest or or you know i'm trying looking for a word in other words you know maybe maybe uh heavier people uh um-hum tend to not be as good workers you know or maybe maybe extra uh uh ultra thin people tend to not be as good workers maybe people that smoke cigarettes aren't as good workers uh you know right certainly and certainly in any case people who drink alcohol a lot are probably not as good workers i think that most drug testing programs don't include that sure they're really interested in looking for illegal drugs it seems to be more for the purpose of law enforcement than for yeah yeah the purpose of the employer's best interest for the job that's true that's true yeah um so we could talk about pets that was my last subject you know oh i see um well we're supposed what's that music in the background uh that's Miles Davis yeah oh okay a little tribute to him or uh right exactly it's on the radio um so ah that's a good background for this conversation all right well anyhow nice talking to you i i don't think we have to stay on the whole time and we've we've agreed too much anyway right okay yeah i guess not and i think we've said about what we have to say sure thing bye bye okay take care have a good day bye bye  okay did you want me to go ahead i'll let you go ahead and start yeah okay well one thing i i i guess both of us have very much aware of the equality uh it seems like women are uh just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in uh jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did um it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes making supper or taking care of the kids versus um the generation of my parents and my great grandmother which uh they did everything they went to work and they took care of the family so you know i think that's changed just in the last generation just in the last little while because i know my father-in-law doesn't do that much of that exactly exactly yeah kind of stuff but my husband is wonderful yeah that's the way my husband is too i mean it it doesn't uh doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes it doesn't bother him him at all to do the laundry versus uh men from yeah way back there is that well if you did that you were henpecked or whatever but yeah yeah there still some that aren't cooperating but men are starting yeah those are very few i think those men don't last very long in relationships because they think women know what they want they're not accepting that anymore yeah right exactly and it's it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything uh you know and then kind of realize hey there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all so it's it's kind of a a neat thing to see as far as equality in the households and i think that's even gonna get better even you know even more so i think it's just gonna be where men will do as much cleaning as women do yeah and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this it will be uh hopefully for my daughter who i instill into it doesn't matter if you wanna drive a truck honey or if it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse it doesn't matter if you want to be uh the President or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor it doesn't matter it's what you want to be so i have always instilled into her and i think mothers um are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say hey you don't have to stay with nursing you don't have to be a secretary you don't have to be you can be whatever you want to be and whether it be a welder a trucker or whatever yeah as long as you uh go to school for it and get the education so yeah well i feel like um to an extent that is really important you know that that um it is important for women who need to work uh or are in a position that they want to um-hum um-hum if they want to right that they can do that um but i also think it is important for them to be with the children um-hum i do too you know there's a certain part of me i i think there there are some things that women just are designed to do better than men and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women i don't think it should ever be totally equal uh-huh yeah yeah you know that's not uh we're not made like that that's right well emotionally i think uh women do a little bit uh i i think that's the gap is coming closer as um what i've learned in uh just just being out there it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings and they get together and they talk about issues of marriage talk about manhood talk about what they didn't have with their fathers hm are expressing more emotions learning what emotions are it may be in the future that men you know some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves um yeah i i know of some mothers that uh i guess i'd rather be with the father because the father is maybe more understanding more um low keyed more apt to be a better father than some mothers that i have seen that have been raised you know to develop whatever skills that they have and some of the men are developing uh very good too so it may come down to where it's yeah it's individual basis where everybody's treated as an individual and not by yeah sex if you wanna stay home and take care of the kids honey that's fine i will go out and make the uh take care of the uh money making and it it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that um-hum and for some it's not a problem but there's more and more it's difficult for a family to make a living on one on one income um-hum income it can be done but you make sacrifices you know and and it's um yeah yeah that kind of like what uh my husband and myself are doing right now my daughter's three even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with she's an only child i don't know if you've only got one yeah  you go ahead and start tell me how you'd you'd organize well why don't you start because you've had more time to think about it if you don't mind okay the things that came across you know they said to make it memorable memorable but i thought first of all you needed to kind of about the same time every year like the same week of the the same month and and then you'd have to send out uh you know good flyers and then mail to all that you wanted to attend and of course food and fun are going to be your your ways to get people there um the ones that i've attended some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some of course just have lunch or um also like at Christmas time it'd be a dinner reunion and uh all kinds of events are usually held i've seen talents for mainly the kids that are there and you need probably information about your ancestors to tie that tie you together
