 yeah what do you think about our level of funding to Middle East Trust well i i think we could use a lot of it at home but definitely a hot spot is the poor last year proved a lot of yeah i was i was thinking while i was waiting to be connected with uh uh another party you know i got real ambivalent uh kind of mixed feelings about it i mean i agree with you i think you know jeez there's an awful lot of money that we go over there to people that seem to be uh shall we say less than appreciative i agree and at and and at the same time it uh you know i think it's important for us that you know there is some sort of stability in that region but i don't know then again you uh historically there has such a history of uh you know just being constantly in turmoil that i don't know if we can throw enough dollars at them to you know keep any kind of a lasting peace over there so i don't it's it's i i guess bottom line if i had to uh to call the shot i would like to see the the money spent a little more uh judiciously uh i i agree i like the i like the the peace process spend more money on things like that and especially with um i don't know the Palestinians and the Israelis fighting so much over who is going to go to this peace conference i'd tie some of the money to those peace conferences if they don't want to go to the peace conference then i guess they don't want the two billion dollars for the next batch of F fifteens or whatever oh yeah yeah but which we'll never do but i i think it is about time especially with the Israelis that we yep yep right because many times in the past they've you know they're happy to take our money and stuff but they often times fail to give us any support in return yeah well that was exactly who i i was thinking about whenever i made the comment of uh you know money going to people that seem less than appreciative i mean they're they're ready to take it and we set you know have have set uh a precedence over the history with them of always having an open pocket book uh and uh you know they've just have grown to expect it and uh i don't mind uh helping people that i mean i don't expect somebody to grovel but at the same time don't uh you know take the money and and then uh slap me in the face right well uh they they seem to do a lot of that stuff the problem i have in the past at least it was you know they were very strategically strategically important to us but i think that's diminished a lot lately too yeah yeah especially with the relationship we've started to develop with Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War and all and i don't know maybe we could use that to our advantage right at least if we are going to be giving them all this money then at least you know we should get some at least some cooperation or whatever in return yeah the one good thing about the Gulf War i i mean there was several good things about it but it was one of the few things that we've ever done as a as a country that i think practically paid for itself right and certainly there are countries over there that have the where with all to uh uh foot their fair share of the bill well that's for sure yeah and we built some good friends over there now with uh time when we can use them you know little rut yeah and and we built we we built some good friends and then we've also built some arch enemies so it's you know it's one tit for tat sort of right well most of the large enemies were large enemies to begin with though there's not too many people that went from being our friends to being our enemies but just that's true that's right that's right i i quite a few that have been from our enemies to at least tolerating us or whatever well yeah especially when if you look back at wasn't very you know that many years ago i mean back in the early seventies whenever the the Saudi's embargoed uh oil to the US we've certainly come a long way since then right that's right uh and i don't know Iran Iran now wants them to reestablish more normal relationships with us i don't know if that is in our best interests either but it's good that i don't know it it seems slightly more stable now but how long that lasts you know it can history has shown that can just be a lull before the storm yeah right right well it's you know like i say just as uh as uh a region i don't know of any uh other part of the world that uh is is so prone to change quickly and and i don't know this seems like you know they're these uh deep seeded hostilities and animosities from that are just uh handed down generation to generation right well they have the all the religious battles they have the nationalist battle they just seem to have a lot of different cultures and religions nationalisms all packed into that one small geographical area they all believe that they have rights to these lands you know there's two three four groups that all believe that this portion of land rightfully is their's you're right hopefully you know optimistically maybe maybe something you know i don't think it's all going to be rosy after this latest round of peace talks but hopefully it can be a start at least in the right direction yeah well i do like your idea of tying uh  and have you lived in Garland long um yeah we're going about six years yeah about six years tell me your name again i'm sorry Carol okay um are you in a new area or old Carol um-hum um well it's about six years old we've lived here as long as the house has been built so i guess it is new in some way although we're learning it's falling apart yeah yeah oh really no that's exaggeration but we had some problems yesterday so oh no leakage or um some plumbing problems oh not so and it damaged the carpet and we're going to have to do something we're not sure call insurance or something so i'm not sure what to do well our house is about um twelve years old i guess we've been in it for about two years and uh-huh i guess there's advantages advantages and disadvantages to moving into a new or old house um one thing it had all of the window treatments you know so we didn't have to redo that and it had been updated but right uh-huh their roof is old was old so uh last year we covered the wood shingles with uh that composition uh-huh and that was cost a fortune and uh oh yeah now we're we're in the process of uh repainting the interior because we didn't paint when we first moved in and uh you know when you shop for houses you don't notice all the little things you think oh this is beautiful and everything and then you find out that it's yeah uh i wouldn't think about the painting you know that it's not as great well there's just a lot of uh i mean it has that well the family before us raised three kids and a dog and cats and and so there's just wear wear and tear on the house but you don't notice uh-huh yeah yeah until you live in it and have to clean it and you know you you find scratch marks on the wood or yeah yeah you know places were the dog chewed or i don't know things like that yeah yeah because we're kind of thinking of uh trying to find a used home and uh the ones we've looked at have been really nice um but you know there's some things you don't really think about looking at in a pre owned home that that you do in a new home so i would say uh you know that uh who is it the inspector you know that you use just um they have a list of things they go over but uh-huh you know i think we had maybe a list on top of that that some friends had of ours had told us to go through and just things that they might not normally look for and and go around with them and even if you're kind of on their you know looking over their shoulder or whatever um um-hum um-hum because there's lots of things that furniture hides and you know we have a place we have picture frame paneling in our living room and it is in beautiful condition it's uh it's a custom home but there's just areas that they skimped on and uh but the um-hum the uh picture frame paneling for the most part is beautiful and and they had this big arrangement on the mantel and it and i think one thing about the house that made us fall in love with it was their decorating you know their furniture once you move in your furniture into the house it's kind of it doesn't have quite the same look but um oh really yeah yeah because we're um you know we haven't been married we've been married for almost four years and uh-huh uh anyway but there's a piece of paneling behind that's above the mantel that has yeah um it's right above the fireplace and i think they there must have been some water running down the chimney behind there because there is some water damage and it's warped and with it being picture frame i don't know how to yeah uh-huh how to replace that one piece without having to tear it all down because it's one of the inset pieces so there's a lot of things to you know to look for and um uh-huh uh yeah yeah yeah but i guess new homes are like that to they probably have things that are constantly yeah needing fixed or at least you probably have to i don't know did did you all did the builder provide the mini blinds and stuff like that or did you all yeah you had to go purchase all that oh no no huh-uh yeah yeah from scratch everything but we're trying to look for a bigger home right now and and what size what size home are you in now right now we're in um seventeen hundred square feet so it's were looking for something a lot bigger because we have two kids uh-huh and uh but i like Garland i love Garland i really really want to stay in Garland if i can but uh you know there's there's other places too like Sachse and that and that area place area out there which is really nice i've been to some friend's house out there and there's just uh there there's some really nice homes out there i'm not really familiar with the homes in Garland i guess i know um i tried  okay well why don't you start because it said i was suppose to ask you what do you do you have any elderly relatives currently in uh in a nursing home now yes i do do you i have a grandmother she's a hundred and two oh my gosh she'll be a hundred and three in August uh-huh and we decided not to put her in a nursing home she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her uh-huh she even though she is a hundred and two she still has all of her faculties right she still has her snap she takes care of her own business this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker but with somebody that needs around the clock care i have seen my family age right i've seen them in the she's been there ten years now and i have seen them age twenty in the time and and with the expense and everything i think i still think it is worth it if you if you had a good nursing home yeah and they needed some quality care i would put someone in a nursing home right my mother-in-law finally they had to make a family decision there's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town and she has Alzheimer's it was getting where she was getting things dangerous i mean letting strangers in and things like this but they were very fortunate it's a small town and um-hum she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't nobody thought she would adjust but she's adjusted beautifully oh well that's good oh that is great but then i am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado she's been taking care of him i don't know how much longer this can last and at that point because he requires round the clock he can't do anything without her he doesn't know when to take his medicine and it's really sad and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for uh my brother's are not interested in helping me so i would have to move him down here that way i want to see the nursing home if i have to put him into one you know where i can go see it i i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado and why yeah i'm sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas yes and some of them are limited care too where people can do uh like they have apartment styles but that wouldn't work for him i think he's beyond that where if you need help you can get it but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them and allows um-hum i i i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in Austin yeah yeah well the only problem with these are that they are very expensive of course i guess all nursing homes there is where but and the bad thing about it before you can get any kind of government help you just practically have we have to be a pauper right it it takes every penny they want you to spend every dime you have before the government will pay for your your care and that's the sad part about it yeah right yeah i see uh yeah and i think a lot of people who do it now in Colorado it's interesting i talked to my mother they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home and my mother could make it on that what she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then i would send it back to her so that's probably what would happen um-hum i think that's what most people do you just have to give it everything away yeah it's unfortunate i i i work at a brokerage firm and i have seen so many people that just have to gift you know their belongings as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home right yeah it's frightening and i guess uh i don't know how old you are i'm forty six you know we're the generation moving into this and i don't know how our kids are gonna take care of us i can't imagine i'm twenty nine and everybody in my family's always had we don't have any children everybody that has has them later in life so my my mother and my father are in their late sixties you know yeah yeah so i mean they're not that far away right yeah i also fill in my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and i don't know how he's ever going to get on his own the way things are oh i know and so it's kind of squeezed you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations but it something will have to change as more and more of us get older uh luckily if we could be like your grandmother i uh you know i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay it but yeah most people aren't but you see these people in their seventies yeah most aren't that's the problem and that's the bad thing i would hate to have lived so long she lived by herself my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety ninety one that's incredible and just did everything and it but most people aren't like  hobbies tonight okay well let me go ahead and press one yeah sure okay Leslie i'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies what do you like to do in your spare time well and when i have my spare time i do enjoy that's a cherished commodity now days huh that's right um i do enjoy uh sewing uh hand you know i do some needlepoint oh great and i i've been doing a a picture for my father-in-law that if i i ever get enough spare time he might see it one day and and some other things i like to do are is music and um also reading uh-huh what kind of music so well i enjoy singing yeah oh okay well great i enjoy music too and i uh one thing that i like to do uh is sit down and and play the piano i can't play that well but i uh sit down and enjoy playing musical selections that i familiar with um my famuel family's familiar with i enjoy that uh couple of hobbies that i also have is uh i enjoy i really enjoy bike riding um-hum and the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they're involved in yes hm yeah like my uh oldest boy is involved in soccer so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play uh throw the football and uh they also like to ride bicycles so we're riding bicycles and so a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are are centered around my my children and also things that my wife and i like to do um-hum together and uh so personally lot of the hobbies that i had when i was growing up um in going to college and so forth are have changed um-hum i really enjoyed uh mountain climbing i really enjoyed skiing um and a lot of outdoor activities and uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in in Texas i can go skiing with that right now but hopefully i'll be able to get back to the slopes someday so that's right yeah i i've not had the opportunity to to go skiing but i grew up in Arizona which had some mountains around it but uh um-hum never did get out and ski you didn't no i never did didn't have the i guess i didn't have the person out there saying hey let me take you skiing and of course i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken places places i couldn't go by myself but yeah that's true that's true and then of course then once i got to the age where i could've done it myself i had other interests i guess so oh yeah i guess that for me it was very helpful my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing oh yeah and so we we went quite often and uh in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing and when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago and we would we would go skiing and enjoy that um-hum um-hum so but uh luckily it's it's kind of unusual because hobbies it's a it's a nice thing to have and it's it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time but like you mentioned and i am finding out a lot of the spare time that i had isn't there that's right it's uh it's uh taken up by activities with uh work with family with um civic and church responsibilities for me um-hum um-hum so yeah i i find that if i i make i have to make myself to realize that it's important to get out there and not you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me oh yes oh yes oh yes yeah and my youngest daughter is gonna to be starting up soccer so she's real excited about doing that so we'll we'll be busy with that again well great what again so you've participated that in the past pardon me have you participated participated in that in the past well i did with my older daughter and she was in it for a few years but she's got so many interests herself that we had to start eliminating and that was first one to go she still likes her piano uh-huh uh-huh and she's in band so so she's got lots of hobbies or uh activities going on sounds it sounds like her life is full too yeah i imagine your life is full taking them around all over the place very much keep that's right that's right all right all right well Leslie it's been very nice talking to you is there anything else that you'd like to mention tonight or um no i think we covered it pretty good thank you for calling okay great well thank you and you have a nice evening bye now you too bye-bye  and how's your weather been well my weather right now is rainy uh this is the most rain i think we've ever seen uh over a twelve month period of time since i moved to to uh to the Texas area um i was uh i've seen climates both rather arid and and and complete and total uh tropical so i've seen kind of the gamut but this is starting to lean towards the uh the tropical end how about you well this is getting to be uh similar to the reason i moved away from Saint Louis all these gray gloomy rainy days you know oh my uh-huh but uh i've been here for about uh well it's going on five years now and this is definitely the rainiest January February uh-huh oh this is this is a neat year you missed the nineteen eighty eighty one uh uh mess the nineteen eighty summer that about roasted everybody and then the eighty one spring that uh where practically every lake in uh North North Texas overflowed well i thought it was bad enough about four years ago when we had the was it three or four years ago when we had the big ice storm i mean we oh yes ma'am well that was that was pretty good uh however the one in seventy nine and uh and uh seventy eight and seventy nine uh dwarfed that one yeah you've been here a while then yes ma'am since uh you know i have been well the firm i am with uh i've been with them them for twenty three years so and they are in the North Texas area oh okay so uh yeah i have seen quite a bit of of weather uh patterns of course like i say uh when i was in the service i got to see plenty of um different uh locals as far as wet and dry uh climates and uh uh i was kind of like you i'm i didn't want to go back to Colorado because of the different because of the tremendous weather we had gosh i think you're the first person from Colorado i have ever heard that didn't say oh it's wonderful it's so dry here um no no no well this actually isn't far enough south for me oh okay i would like to get down to oh Tampa some place like that where Tampa Florida at least yes uh-huh well let's see my in-laws uh winter in uh the Leesburg area is that down the coast of Florida well it's uh in the Orlando area okay and Tampa Saint Petersburg is not that super far away no i think it's a couple hours drive if i yeah something like that i think we made to from their house to uh Bush Gardens in ninety minutes that day uh you may have been speeding a little bit though no no no no no no no not not at that not down that uh uh tollway they've got i see they're they're smokies you think our smokies are bad with with uh uh our uh little Mustangs that are hot rods they got them there too oh yeah is that right i know we uh were uh over run by one in uh we went down for Christmas and we were cruising cruising along in our little rental car and uh this this this car comes over the hill and pass me and it was one of those puppies and he was flat moving do they arrest people there uh unlike Dallas yeah yeah he's he he pulled one he pulled one over and was uh steady having a little chat about something other than the weather that's for sure because i mean he didn't look happy when we went by so i don't know maybe it was uh who knows but anyway this weather here is is certainly evolved from a from a dryer hotter uh nineteen eighty to uh the present the the last summer we had i think we barely what cleared a hundred maybe i think that was stretching it well uh i'll tell you i will definitely take the hot summers oh well believe you me i'm not not advocating cold summers no no no no no no no wrong wrong wrong but uh uh the summer of nineteen eighty we saw one hundred fifteen and one hundred sixteen and i was running a little heating and air-conditioning business at the time no kidding i'll bet you just did all kinds of business well uh what happened there was that most of our customer everybody's customers uh down here about April start to call call everybody you know call their their local guys um-hum and we go out and tune up the systems um-hum and we are normally expecting some a hundred hundred degree days so we tune for that um-hum so we had everybody nice in tune when the hundred and fifteen degree weather hit yes and so what the only thing that got replaced were the weak systems you know that would barely make it at one hundred but when the hundred and fifteen degree days hit well it just couldn't couldn't handle the load and they then they then the compressors blew like popcorn oh i'll bet i mean just this pop pop bang bang  um what product did you have returned i had to uh i had to return a that recently i've had to return uh uh a cassette recorder um my feelings about products made in the United States uh recently is they are getting worse uh in fact i am kind of disappointed in American made things uh how about yourself well i'm kind of confused about American made products because Ford and Chevy have Isuzu Mazda engines and they're considered American products so i don't understand if we are supposed to not buy Volvos and Volkswagons and Mazdas because they are foreign or if we are supposed to buy American because they're foreign but they are American cars you know what i am saying um-hum and i just don't understand that um-hum and it seems that whenever you do have a product parts of it are both American and overseas that it creates a problem um-hum both in uh the product and in the overall warranty or lasting have have you recently bought a car yes i did what what did you buy i bought a Chrysler New Yorker and my daughter bought a Plymouth Sundance they are pretty much a hundred percent American made aren't they no uh i was surprised yes Chrysler has some of their parts built overseas also or you know is that right and i thought that was totally American hum and uh that's why i stayed away from General Motors and find out that the same thing happened to me anyway i am really surprised to hear about uh i i haven't studied cars probably as closely as you have um i was really surprised that you mentioned uh Chrysler no it was GM and Ford that are um using Japanese motors and and engines that's true hum huh it seems that they're quote unquote American made where was your VCR um it what was it and what went wrong with it yeah let me see it was a Lloyd and um it it continually i don't know if i think it is Japanese i think Lloyd is made in Japan and uh it it was eating my tapes and uh i don't know i am totally uh totally confounded about uh uh American made and Japanese and i'm not sure which is the best i use the Consumer Digest a lot to decide what i want to buy yeah i do too i don't read it but sometimes i did you know that Fitzhugh is a Japanese computer company and they deliberately make boards and parts wrong so you will have to buy them hum and it cannot be repaired and that upset me when i found that out huh do you own a computer no i don't but my daughter does and she worked with a computer company that uh serviced them and she is the one that told me about that because uh we were we are thinking about buying a computer we haven't done it yet and uh since she works for this computer computer company i asked her what she thought was best cause if TI was using Macs and IBM clones and this type of thing and uh she was saying that she didn't know which one was the best because of the way they're put together and then she was telling me about this uh uh computer boards just put in X number of uh computers and then they last for eighteen months to no longer than two years and then instead of repairing them you have to buy a whole new board i didn't realize that i work for a CPA firm and we have a lot of computers in our office and uh the computers we use mostly are Dell computers and they are manufactured down in Texas by whom uh Dell Computers Dell Corporation Dell Corporation where do they get their parts from Fitzhugh uh uh uh i i don't know ma'am uh i wouldn't be surprised if most of them aren't Japanese parts but uh we've had the Dell computers for four years now and we we're really happy with them are you and we use them every day we use them probably eight hours a day on the average every day so they get a lot of use well maybe you're well you're probably fortunate you've probably got one of the better ones yep so you work part time with an accountant also i i'm full timing with the accountant's office oh  do you feel you're paying too much in tax oh i always feel i'm paying too much for everything that's part of my problem i wonder if we wouldn't be better off um you know with a little more free enterprise than having the government do some much for us yeah that's what my i don't know those are some of my feelings i think free enterprise does it for a better price i think you're right there uh it might be a little more ruthless uh to go with the free enterprise system the government has a sort sort of a habit of investing in things that don't pay much return and into getting into projects that uh there is no yield on the investment so it's all money down the rat hole yeah yeah it doesn't it doesn't seem like we really get our uh i don't know i i don't think we get the best for the buck if that's if that's a good way to put it but um-hum um uh do you now do you live close to uh uh you know to a government installation of any kind or no i'm uh sort of in Fairfax County working for uh one of the uh free loaders on the government uh government contract uh group uh oh okay so you know it from the contract side so you know somebody once accused uh accused us of uh uh being a welfare program for engineers yeah my father worked uh for the government uh here in Utah at the Hill Air Force Base where i mean you know that was the occupation that he had all the time i was growing up and um-hum and we got a good living out of it but i know just from talking with him there were it was like you said there are a lot of things that go on that just just make you wonder that they don't really even get the best out of the people that are working for them so it makes me wonder where we're where we're going with that um-hum well i think my father went through his life saying that he just keeps paying taxes and paying taxes and paying taxes and he never got anything out of the government for it yeah uh well they uh uh yeah they they they provide a lot of services that we don't yeah you you know that we don't really see or notice i guess but it just seemed like if if we had you know some kind of a private enterprise system well the welfare is a good example that uh you know if if welfare is handled at the local level by small groups like the churches and some of the organized charities that that get people involved directly um-hum um-hum uh then the money gets right straight to the people and there's a lot of volunteer work and and supporting that type of operation yeah but you let the government handle it and next thing you know you're spending four out of five dollars just to administer it yeah i and it just seems like nothing gets down to the people i think i think that's a really good point because i i i think you know welfare is one of the one of the big problems huh and it it's interesting that in uh in a way it's interesting to me that that like in the foreign in Russia and those kind areas where they're having their struggles right now you know they're gonna have to have a welfare system um-hum in order for in order to improve their life over there and i i hope they don't pattern theirs after our yeah yeah well i'm afraid they may have a more bureaucratic system than we do uh i think one of my biggest concern on taxes is uh real estate uh taxes down at the local level the federal government seems to be pretty stable you know you can figure out what they're gonna charge you next year um-hum but uh since i moved into this house five years ago the real estate tax has doubled and i'm just afraid that by the time i'm ready to retire and uh the mortgage is paid off on this house i won't be able to afford the taxes on it um your monthly taxes will be as high as your monthly payment yeah well that was true on the last house i bought i got a thirty year mortgage on it and by the time i uh sold it the the tax payment was a bigger part of the uh yeah that is the of the mortgage payment yeah hm that that is scary because that really makes you wonder what they're doing with that i and i figure it just says that uh when i'm ready to retire i'm gonna have to move out of Fairfax County and get out in the country some place um-hum uh and there's no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh you know there's no recourse and what what do you think you get out of your taxes your property taxes well the property taxes are supposed to pay for education and some of the county services um-hum uh and i i hope that some of that is working efficiently we have a pretty good school system i'm a little concerned that there's too much paper work there for them  alright okay okay um so what kind of uh uh piece of property have you got we've got a home and uh very large front and back yard we had a lot of Dallas grass what they call Dallas Dallas grass and others parts of country call Crab grass that real thick grass and we had a problem with that but we've seemed to've taken care of it how about you um um-hum um-hum well um i um up here we don't have too much trouble with Crab grass or anything like that um uh we've uh like we rent the house that we live in but we've got a pretty large piece of uh land that we live on even though very close into Washington DC um-hum and so most of the work that we have to do involves mowing the lawn and um uh uh my sweetheart who i live with uh does a lot of uh flower gardening and stuff around the house she gets a lot of pleasure from that what flowers does she like hm um well it changes from year to year and she's thinking this year she's gonna get into bulbs and that sort of thing but most of the sorts of things that she uh has grown in the past have been um i guess wild flowers and uh some stuff that our neighbors sort of brings over periodically she's also she likes things like Hollyhocks and uh Peonies and and uh oh let's what else has she got oh the other things she's really into is Morning Glories and uh in the summer time we have Morning Glories just all over the house it's great all different colors um-hum yeah they climb too yeah it's it's a lot of fun it's real pleasant in fact our next door neighbor in Christmas time this year couldn't resist giving us a set of coffee cups had Morning Glories all over them and uh she she found them and she said oh i just had to buy them for you but uh we're also really into vegetable gardening do you have a problem with any type of uh insects or gophers or anything actually yeah actually we do we we don't have any um any uh you know varmints or anything like that that that tend to bother the garden but we do have a lot of trouble with insects particularly caterpillars um we've had very very poor luck with uh all of the core crops and like um uh and cabbage and and uh broccoli and cauliflower and that sort of if you uh sprinkle lime on your young plants before they get too big that should help that uh-huh well that's um exactly what we've done and you're you're advice is is dead on in in our experience in fact uh thing that we've found works even better than lime is diatomaceous earth yeah that works that's kind of hard to get a hold of sometimes uh yeah well um Jackie got a hold of a huge box of it so much of it that i dare say that we'll probably still using be using it five years from now she went out to some uh pool supply place and and got this huge box of it and it's really it's big and she came home with it and she was real proud and she said okay well we've got a lifetime supply now so we've got no excuse and uh what vegetables do you grow the most well we uh have uh i guess in the last two or three years really discovered that we're really fond of hot peppers and so um we grow tomatoes down one side of the house where we get a lot of sun and then in our regular garden plot this past uh couple of years we've grown a lot of different varieties of hot peppers do you have jalapenos uh yes which of course are our favorites and uh but we've also grown a lot of real um uh hot uh smaller varieties like Tais and um um-hum do you have the small red ones cayenne uh yeah yeah the cayennes and we've even grown some little funny uh uh peppers and i've never i've never been sure one of them i believe is called Chili Tepid and the other one is called Pequine and um they're they're little tiny hot things that we she takes them inside and she dries them and then we eat and i've heard of the Chili but i've never heard of the Pequine what are they are they green red and yellow what they're little green literally pea size peppers they're they're just little tiny guys and they dry up even smaller than they are when they're they're you know fresh food on the um um-hum the plant but the plants are just incredibly prodigious they just produce zillions of them um what do you use them for mainly uh all kinds of dishes we like i say we grind them up and um we freeze some of them and then use them in stews and uh whenever we make egg dishes or anything like that we tend to to put some on it it's just incredible with the numbers of ways that we come up to use them and uh it's it's funny i mean we were laughing at ourselves one night because we uh we realized that um we had uh we were having it with every meal but anyway it it's uh it's something that we enjoy immensely and it we get a lot of pleasure out of i love tilling up the garden every year and um uh you know getting out there and just spending some  Allen uh the question is concerning the changes in the roles of American women in the past several generations and you know the in their in the society we live in what do you think has occurred there well i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home that's probably even one of the major changes i see over the last period of time um-hum but uh are are they being given the full uh honor for the work they're doing and for the um oh my gosh can't think of the word but for the what they have to accept well that's that they're responsible for it absolutely responsibilities is what i'm trying to say oh i don't think so i think it's come a long ways in terms of giving them equal opportunities but i still think in lots of job markets they're not treated as equals in the words in some in some respects the other direction that in some job markets they really don't wanna be treated as equals uh-huh by the same token most in in most cases women have the jobs with the same responsibility of men who been there before but at lower lower salaries is is that right wrong yes i think that's generally speaking pretty true and i think that's what we really ought to look at that going is if they're gonna do equal work they ought to get equal pay is that yes and that uh they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions and i don't think we've gotten there yet um-hum yeah what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years any individual thing or is it just a general switch over oh boy i think it's generally that switch over and i and i think that switch over has been more in the work force i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home that the husband's having them on the other side of that coin picked up as much responsibility at home so they have one and three quarters jobs now um-hum whereas the husbands have one and a quarter i have a feeling that biness with a woman working out at the same level of responsibility as their husband sort of tears into their social or their loving relationship in that uh yeah the the lady stand wants to stand up for what she has made and her own rights and has every right to do so and this upsets the man because uh we've always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household so do you think that is gonna be uh difficult saying as far as uh marriages and people enjoying each other in the future years yes yeah and i think also in terms of parenting i think there's gonna be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting and i'm not sure they're becoming any more skilled at it um-hum because i think it really has put some additional additional stresses on family units well do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur occur in the next generation specifically well i i think one of the things that always happens is i think we'll swing to one end whereas you know where were moving at to the end where a lot of women will be at work um-hum and then i think we starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties and so i was saying you know this career thing isn't all it's cracked up to be and i wanna go back and do something else so i think we'll probably see this swind pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit um-hum although so much of it's driven by economics right now people have gotten out and gotten use to two incomes coming in yes well i actually most lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can be brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they're gonna get yeah and the people well how do you feel about women in uh armed services well i think they ought to have the right i i have some problems with my own family thinking about my wife going to combat and or my wife or my daughter's going into combat but i have problems with men doing that and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it it's nothing i'd be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for yeah um yeah i somehow can't do that i well i was brought up in the ages when the ladies were kept home safe secure and made happy and the men went out and took the responsibility of earning the money bringing in whatever they needed and and protecting the household and it and it really still bothers me and i spent plenty of years in the service but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there's two or three of them there and five hundred men around them and how are they gonna protect themselves so to speak i agree it puts them in a very bad situation i i i really don't go for that well i think one of the other things that concern has concerned me a little bit and i think i see some change in attitudes there my wife happens to be a wife who's chosen to stay at home um-hum and there's a a tendency has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence because if she did she'd be out in the work force uh and fulfilling herself yep well that's not fair because i tell i can tell you one thing stay home sometime and start uh doing some of those jobs that she's been handling and you're gonna learn there's a lot of responsibility in just keeping a home going and i hope we reach the point where whatever women women chose to do that's acceptable if they chose to go into the work force that's okay if they choose not to that's acceptable yeah yeah and if they go in the work force they should be treated as nicely as as well as a man or any other person and uh not as equals  hi this my name's Bridgette Bridgette this is Maureen hi nice to meet you um do you know what we're supposed to talk about yeah if there's something wrong with the school system yeah so are you ready then okay sure i press one don't i okay i've never done this before so okay right oh you there okay uh-huh okay so what do you think is wrong with the school system well you know i was listening to uh Sixty Minutes i think the other night they had Andy Rooney on there and one of the comments he was making is that um uh-huh you know part of the problem is uh parents and um their lack i guess of uh interest in the kids in school and he said do you know basically until we change that uh we're not gonna have the kids uh get any smarter because um you know they're not encouraging their kids to do well in school so uh-huh otherwise we're not gonna ever achieve a good education system unless we really get the parents involved yeah i agree with that but that's coming from because i'm in college right now and seeing how the school systems are my mom's a teacher that's very hard to do in some areas you know it's like they sent um-hum yeah and i know where my mom teaches you know and she teaches in like a lower class part of Plano and where it is is they just send their kids to school and you know they don't care if they do their homework if they don't do their homework whatever right so she says it's very hard from that aspect i mean she'll call the parents and they you know they're like well you know that's not my responsibility it's yours um and i know she gets real frustrated being a teacher that she feels like you know that the parents aren't willing to do that which is very scary i think yeah another another thing i think though is uh i know now because i'm getting ready to graduate and friends of mine that are getting teaching degrees are um people that aren't getting a master's are having an easier time uh getting a job because they can get paid less oh yeah and it seems like they're just compromising good qualified educated teachers just for someone they can pay less and they get they don't get paid much now and i think that's really bad yeah it's kind of a shame that um we don't put emphasis and money where we really should i mean we've never really paid teachers real well uh-huh we've never paid um other public servants like the police and such very well it is kind of a shame um yeah there are some times i think that uh you know the quality of teachers may be improved upon i think what they did a few years ago was kind of a joke about testing the teachers and all yeah uh-huh i think it was um i think that i think that they're made some changes you know into um the the kind of courses that should be involved in education curriculum and um trying to improve improve upon them uh somewhat but um they've never really paid you know real well and and you know people have to pick a an occupation that's gonna support themselves it can't be all sacrifice and no you know salary you got to live on something uh-huh yeah uh-huh but i think it's hard though because even like the like in high school and stuff you take the standardized tests and stuff and i know people that you know are like dyslexic i mean i know people in college that are like dyslexic um-hum um that i wonder how they pass through all their school you know all their years of school yeah and pass through all the tests that they had to pass through and so forth to get to college because they have the hardest time you know things like that always make me wonder too i mean they make all these tests but are they really proving anything um-hum yeah true and you know some people are much better test takers than others um yeah that's definitely true some people you know um just really clam up when it comes to a test and they're so nervous about well is there a is this a trick question and instead of being real straight forward and just trying to answer it they um-hum um give themselves you know worse grade because they were so anxious about it see yeah and then other people you know aren't that upset about it and they test very well so there has to be different ways of of testing sometimes you know because um that isn't always a real good reflection of if the person's learned it or not um-hum yeah i agree i think there's just so many problems now with just kids you know younger these days and all the problems they have and all the problems like in general in the world like with gangs and stuff just being brought into the school is making it worse i think that's not even helping at all yeah you know uh i i wouldn't wanna be back in school now i think it uh it's a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um i don't know counseling or or psychologists you know psychologist or just you know talking about how to get along in life if they're not getting that so much from home yeah  how do you uh feel about the metric system well uh i i was just talking to my dad about that just a couple of weeks ago and i think i think it'd be great that we went to it and uh the the one thing though that i think we should do if we go to the metric system then we should do away with the other system and and have only the metric system well yeah i'll tell you i was i was thinking about it while i was waiting for a connection uh-huh and i in my business i have to do conversions back and forth between metric tons and uh then i converted into barrels and gallons and then i deal with long tons and so forth and so on and i will admit that it does make it uh right yeah yeah yeah uh perhaps a little bit cumbersome at the same time i don't know it's one of the oddities one of the few things that are left you know is is as the world shrinks we become more and more homogenized everybody yeah well that's true yeah it seems to uh uh you know it it's like it's like accents even you know there's not used to be there's a great variation across the US and now with television everybody is beginning to sound like uh a news uh announcer you know yeah yeah yeah that's true you're right you're right there's no losing we're losing our culture of our area uh-huh and and the whole um i don't know it yeah but i i don't know i kind of got a soft spot in my uh my heart for feet and inches even though i i like i say in in my business i do have to uh to work around it sure yeah yeah well i uh i work in a hospital and of course that's all we use and every and every thing we do is metric you know and uh you know weights is in kilograms and uh you know whatever whatever is whatever happens to be the thing that we're measuring it's in metric yeah you know i think one of one of the reasons that i've got some hesitancy about doing it is that i still have a difficult time and uh i mean there are few of pieces of the metric system that i can visualize okay i i i've gotten pretty good at at at you know i realize about that how long a a meter is yeah yeah right right okay but as far as you know and it's uh i've kind of got the conversion of different parts of the metric system where i'm comfortable with it but i'm not with weights yeah yeah and and until i i i guess it would be something that if i had been uh uh a little more educated in it or forced into using it more i might be more comfortable with it yeah yeah sure right well uh uh one one of the things that really i i really think it would be sort of weird is is the uh cars the miles per hour instead of having uh having kilometers um kilometers per hour uh-huh cause it it's hard to imagine you know i well i think the problem with us our generation is that nobody even if we did go all the way to the metric system that we're still going to think in terms of how it relates to the other system you know well well sure it'd take a new generation it would take a new generation to be just you know completely metric no matter what you that's right that's right because it's hard to it's just like uh another language i guess yeah i think you're right and when you learn another language um i guess what you have to do is try to think in that language and not think in in terms of translating it to English you know but yeah well you know they try to in one of the in one of the parts of the question they ask you know just ask to ask us to discuss was uh uh why why the first attempt failed you know and i was thinking i don't i don't know i i don't really have a good answer for that other than i guess it was just that much uh uh resistance to change yeah yeah i think so too and i think that uh that it was it was pretty much optional wasn't it at the time and and uh that's true and and the other thing too they're they were going to use both systems you know simultaneously yeah that's right see that's why i think it is i think they used both systems and everybody as long as they had inches they could just transpose back and forth and it made it difficult so everybody thought well this is too much trouble right but uh of course if you didn't have anything available but metrics i think it'd be a little easier on you you know yeah they didn't until uh you know uh strawberries by anything but uh kilograms then you know rather than pounds that's right that's right you you'd you would just quit thinking you wouldn't worry about how many ounces is this you would just say well how many how many uh grams is it you know and sure yeah and then and then you could you know people would start looking seeing a you know a quantity and they would say well hey that you know that's about that looks to be about two pounds and hey that's this much you know in metric so you know yeah sure yeah yeah and it's uh like weight you know i i weigh about a hundred and sixty five and that's i know somewhere in the neighborhood of seventy something kilograms you know and it's it's hard to imagine well only seventy something you feel like you don't weigh much you know um-hum um-hum but um i guess if that's the only thing you knew well you would just know well i weigh seventy something kilograms and that's it you know yeah of course i've i do think there's always that there's still kind of a uh i don't know a a romance if you will with the idea of a yard being the uh the link from the king's nose to the tip of his uh finger or you know well that's true yeah i understand that it's that's true that's very true that's very true so i you know and and that that and i i think i don't know then all these other old English stories that go back you know that with our uh with our system of measurement yeah that's right it's funny that uh i guess all that started in England i guess all the measurement system of measurement and now uh we're still using it and they are gone they've left it you know and they use metrics there yeah yeah although although although although there are  um so you have a son i have a an older son yeah he doesn't have any children yet though uh-huh uh he's thirty seven and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids um-hum that i go out and uh i play ball with them you know it's because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for them um-hum uh-huh which is kind of sad you know yeah so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we have let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids i would think so when you when when your son was at home did you um working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him no when my son was at home i i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know uh-huh yeah well when my mom uh when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights uh-huh and uh as a nurse and so she was always home for us uh-huh and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked but now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but uh i don't know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids because most most of them the father and the mother both work you know yeah so it's really rough um i have one neighbor that's uh the father is a fireman and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so he's got a second job um so he's you know he's not home very often yeah and that's you know the kids i know miss that you know they really do uh a family without a father is it's a it's a really hard thing yeah you know and i don't know i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know uh-huh but uh kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway oh i'm sure they would you know so are you planning on to having any children or oh yeah oh yeah our uh-huh but we're um we just got married like like December so we're going to wait a year and then we will try um-hum um yeah well that's good yeah that's that's what my uh daughter-in-law had told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage uh-huh and they will be married nine years this year so i don't know she's a nurse you know and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that uh if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night yeah that's a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that that couple you know you know but uh you're not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family uh-huh uh-huh so and giving your values to you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know they're loved and stuff give them give them an edge but right right right we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other uh-huh right right but then a family is is definitely a high priority yeah uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what well i um i'm in a different situation i am a missionary uh-huh and i'm home on on furlough it's called like i've worked for four years in Africa and i come home for a year um-hum um-hum and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and we'll be living in in Africa and we'll be working together um-hum so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother i'll have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still we'll share that job um-hum um-hum but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program um-hum you know that kind of thing um-hum or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and that's a  now do you have any pets uh yes we currently have three we have two cats and a dog oh you do well we have quite a big household here oh my goodness are they uh a specialty kind of um cats or well they're um uh the we have a solid black one that's kind of long hair and uh but he's i don't know he's has a little Persian in him but we're not not sure how much and um-hum that we inherited the neighbors uh Persian and when they had to move to a place that wouldn't allow cats so uh he was like a full full blooded Persian um and then our dog's a big old golden retriever oh my um-hum how about you you have some well we have uh a cat and a dog and a turtle and a turtle hm a turtle we have a turtle uh the the turtle kind of was inherited from the school where i teach the uh children found it last year going out through the uh property it's just a small one it's not one of those large ones at all it's one a very very small turtle uh-huh and they had it in their classroom all year long almost and were going to let it go and i didn't have the heart it it wasn't even my classroom it was the next door classroom i didn't have the heart to watch them let it go so i said i would keep it during the summer time so uh we are oh was it well we we were in uh similar we kind of did a did a similar thing uh we inherited a lizard from my uh my son's uh uh class oh gee and uh it it it it it finally it died about two weeks ago so my son had a uh yeah uh had had a little funeral he made a little coffin and he buried it in the yard and made a little cross for it oh oh uh-huh oh my goodness well you know and it's it's it's very hard for me to have any living uh creatures and and then uh sort of watch them disappear it was no trouble to have this turtle it has uh tank and then they don't do anything and it's not large yeah yeah yeah and uh our cat uh is a another little story we've had the cat for several years now but um uh uh when my my children uh started school at Cistercian school up in Irving you might be familiar with it since you're from the general location it's a boys school well anyway uh one of the persons in the car pool okay uh their cats were always having kittens and uh my husband was driving the car pool one day he was off from work and he said he'd accept one of the cats now i had been avoiding this for years oh had you but he said that when the cats were weaned that we would take one of the cats uh-huh now i don't really mind i don't really mind but i know that once you take a little living creature there that there's another responsibility in in the house and uh yes yes there is and uh so we have uh a uh what do we have Siamese all the Siamese traits came out in this one particular cat it's not a thoroughbred Siamese uh-huh but it looks if you were to see it you'd say oh you have a Siamese cat but i know it's not a thoroughbred but it it and we have had her for many it looks Siamese yeah oh gosh i think we've had her almost eight years now yeah seven years or something well we just had a uh uh oh it happened about a year ago we had a cat that we had for uh twenty years uh the the year we got married we we got the cat and she finally uh died right after uh Christmas a a year ago oh my oh my and that was kind of uh uh a sad parting but she had a little bit of Siamese um-hum uh if you looked at her face you'd you'd picture Siamese although she was solid black too but right um-hum um uh my wife uh uh uh kind of missed her because she was uh a cat you could hold in your lap and stuff the two cats we have now don't care at all to be oh i see held or anything like that um-hum um-hum well our our cat is um is not the most lap cat although she will uh when she's uh in the right mood uh you know let you hold her on her lap uh and you know she's not uh uh-huh uh a a bad cat but uh she she kind of is her own cat in in her own way although as i said she will uh she will come around you and she will let you hold her but she's not really a lap cat hum-um yeah yeah on on her own terms and what kind of what kind of dog do you have yeah oh we have a um a black uh Lab oh okay yeah they're friendly too and actually it's a cross between a golden and a black so it has longer hair oh okay and we've we've had her now for um oh about almost ten or eleven years now is is she a real a real friendly type of dog oh yeah  the opportunity to uh talk with someone with my name no there's really not very many no there really aren't uh when i went to school there was probably three you know in various ages but you don't you don't find that name very often uh-huh that's interesting well are you uh involved in any kind of home repair projects right now uh we just got through having the ceiling in the kitchen touched up did y'all have the roof we had a lot of rain and the roof was leaking and it went down and had a big spot on the ceiling and we intended to to fix it ourselves oh and that didn't work so we ended up hiring just uh a handy man and it turned into a huge project for him um and he couldn't he tried to match the spot and he couldn't match it and ended up having to do the whole ceiling over the whole well we have a spot just like that in our kitchen but we haven't uh it's just a stain you know it's not really it's a stain on the paint it's not where water actually leaked uh-huh uh on the floor i mean it's not like a hole in the ceiling and um i don't know i know there's stuff you can get sealer and stuff that actually has some color to it but we are probably going to have to end up repainting the whole ceiling too yeah i think so but we tried just at first just kind of spackling it it's one of those type ceilings this is an older house and we were trying to just repair that and match the the uh texture oh uh and we couldn't do that and then uh is it like a is it like a popcorn ceiling or what's the texture it's i'm not even sure what it is it's not like the kind at my mother's house is a blown texture oh uh-huh and this is an old older house and it's kind of a sponge is what it looks like to me huh that they took the uh plaster and kind of sponged it huh but it's a different pattern and he had so much trouble trying to match it and the paint and everything he finally just had to redo the whole ceiling repaint the whole thing well that's probably the easiest thing to do i guess in that case uh-huh but he uh i was surprised he stuck with the price that he had quoted wow which was just a couple a hundred dollars to fix the one place and then he found out that the beam there was not support to attach his stuff to and it turned out to be a mess huh he finally finally got it finished well and it looks nice it does i was i because it took several days and i work so he was on his own during the house during the day and then i would just have to come home and call him at night and say excuse me uh-huh this doesn't look good yeah because he was going to let it go if i hadn't said anything at first when it didn't match and stuff he was just going to go with that and i am sure nobody would notice if they come in they don't look up immediately but i noticed but when he fixed it right right but this the house it belongs to my father-in-law and our deal as far as living here and each month we fix something uh-huh and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom and wallpaper but just as soon as you get finished with one job it's time for another one well we are in the midst of all that now too we've lived in our house for uh two years and uh my dog it's just uh she's like a child she wants to play as soon as you get the phone she my dog is trying to uh a fifty pound dog is trying to get in my lap uh anyway uh so we really have not done much to the house we kind of worked on the landscaping outside but but this year we've made uh kind of a list of things we want to do and we devote half of every Saturday to our work projects and then one night a week and uh so right now we are painting our master bedroom actually it's my husband i can't i am expecting so i am not suppose to be around the paint fumes so oh well see you chose a good job well congratulations when is your baby due yeah i chose a good job so i don't have to help when is it due July uh-huh well that good it won't be too hot so we're we're working on the master bedroom first and then we'll eventually get to the baby's room and you know try to decide what we want to do in there but uh we have the people that lived here before us uh uh the house is about twelve years old and ouch she just tried to bite me uh but it it's a custom home and it has a lot of neat things to it but they also went i think a cheap route you know that they on some things and there's one wall in this bedroom that uh uh-huh that uh are in one of our guest bedrooms that was painted gray and the rest of the walls are white and it looks like it must have had wallpaper on it and they took the wallpaper off and then tried to re-texture it and it's horrible it just looks like it just rained uh-huh  hey Cissy what kind of books do you enjoy um i mysteries mysteries murder mysteries true murder mysteries uh-huh and uh tacky romances uh-huh sounds like we like the same kind what do you what have you read lately well see i read the uh oh Helen McImes i read a trilogy of hers oh i got that The Cradle uh yeah a set a group of three in one book The Cradle will Fall and is that the right who's is that one uh she's the one that writes uh uh they're real good she's been writing for a long time and i was trying to remember she wrote one uh she writes they've always have gone the spy um uh thing with them you know setting in in foreign places or and they're they always have kind of a twist to them i've read i've read a few of hers i was just thinking i i just read a trilogy of Mary Higgins Clark oh yeah um-hum and uh that's so that's why i got confused but yeah those are good too and uh-huh and then i got uh some of Robert Ludlum's i like those too do you like him i've read all of his yeah i get the Supreme Bourne Supreme the Bourne ones i get them all mixed up i can't oh it's been so long since i've read them but i will buy those in hardback yeah i have a lot of those in hardback too and uh uh and did you read Fried Green Tomatoes no is it a good book oh it's wonderful where did you get it well my daughter gave it to me uh quite a while ago to read and uh then uh uh i guess what brought it to mind uh was that uh last time i went to see the movie and uh it did not disappoint me and it's it's just so well written of course Fanny Flag wrote it uh-huh and uh it's uh it's got humor in it and a little bit of suspense suspense uh-huh and uh uh and you'll cry so well i loved Steel Magnolias i heard it was similar to that well i think i didn't read Steel Magnolias but i think it's probably better than Steel Magnolias were the movie is anyway and Steel Magnolias was tremendous yeah that's one of my favorites but uh this one it just uh sort of has a well my husband enjoyed it i i just kind of mixed you know mixed feelings i didn't know whether he would it might be a woman's movie uh-huh but uh he just he just raved about the actresses in it that they were so good and everything was real and it was just really good and the reason my daughter gave it to me is because my mother is in a nursing home um-hum and i think that uh she was trying to give me something to kind of make me get a message of some kind yeah but uh it was good i might go get it because i i'm reading Newsweek right now and i'm going to be finished in a minute and and Bookstop stays open till eleven um-hum um-hum well i would highly recommended it and don't get discouraged in the first few chapters oh i i don't do that i read those i read pretty quickly because well you may have to go i do to and i had to go back and reread because you have to get the they're telling two stories at once um-hum and you have to get it straight and get the names straight that's the thing get all the names straight that could be difficult but uh uh-huh where you you're working with two stories and once you get that down it flows and you can't wait to get to the next part it uh it's one of those that you get caught up in i read uh Prince of Tides i haven't seen that movie yet oh i haven't read that book was it good yes it was okay i'll have to see if i can get it well i'll bring it next meeting oh all right wonderful wonderful because i don't have i don't have anything to do with them when i finish with them you can't sell them for anything no you can't i'd love to borrow it from you okay all right um we're all supposed to say what do we read for improvement what have you read for improvement i read some self help books but um-hum i think i like i like to spend my time reading for enjoyment i do too and uh well if if you're like me there're so many technical things to read that when i read at home at work yeah yeah i just don't want to to well of course i i garden a lot and i read a lot of gardening things i have Neil by my bed but uh oh yes Neil and then the American Gardening Society puts out a real good book on on vegetables i don't have i've got three dogs um-hum you don't need vegetables no you have problems even with flowers well well yeah i do i do yeah they're in the front yard um-hum yeah it's a good place for them if the dogs um-hum  to face the situation where you were looking at putting a loved one in the nursing home well i we're sort of in the middle of it um really last February we brought my mother from Florida to us here in Texas and so far she has been with us but i really look to the future that it may be occurring um i don't know what i'll do i i'm almost inclined to hire somebody um to be in our home with her rather than have to um-hum um-hum put her somewhere you know but uh-huh you don't feel as though that that's a decision you're comfortable with because well i think partly and it's not me it's the it seems to me the older generation my mother and father and my in-laws you'd be um you know the stigma used to be you went there and and you died and so they have all kind of you feel as though they are being abandoned if you leave them somewhere right you know it just um and you try and say you know they're nice now or or nicer and you know i wouldn't want her in one in Florida because i couldn't check on her but if she were in one near here i i would probably be there uh-huh uh-huh you know several times per week and i would sure stand up and scream if i saw things that were you know improper or or uh you know her care was not um-hum um-hum it's difficult boy i really have you had that experience yet can appreciate no i haven't but um well i i work in a hospital and we see patients oh whose families are just not able to care for them once they've left the hospital and so they have to make that decision often when the patient's still in the hospital right it's uh well my father died several years ago and that was you know he had cancer and eventually the hospital comes and says you know your father uh care you know Medicare says he doesn't need the level of care to be hospitalized so you are going to uh-huh eventually they'll come and tell you you will have two days to you know move him somewhere else and and that my mother and i needed to think what do we want to do at that point we did because he was so then you begin right not yet comatose but real close and he lived two weeks in the nursing home so we did do that but um at at that time three and a half years ago my mother was in such a um-hum um-hum state of depression i didn't think she could handle even if we had full time around the clock care i didn't think yes emotionally she could handle him being there it well it yes that too you you know there is no question that uh yes it's a challenging job physically just moving them about is um difficult but it really is and it's just uh and i have friends whose we're all in the age group where um-hum were thinking about some of these things for our parents and it really is uh yes yes what are some of the things that you have looked for for example with your father what what helped you identify an appropriate placement was it was it geographic was it how close it was to you or with well of course this again was in Florida actually the level of care and in fact two that we looked at were you know they were all in mauve and blue and very elegant looking and oh that's right and so on but i didn't like the fact that they had you know eight patients for one uh you know nurse or one care giver and the one we selected was not nearly as care giver uh-huh uh up to date however it was clean and the patients were well cared for and i like it because it had a level of five to one and i felt that that would be yes better care for my father uh and but several of her neighbors and friends oh but you ought to i said i know but um-hum we're making this decision and my mom basically let me make the decision so um-hum um and she was pleased with it because he did get um you know just wonderful care that's a pretty important factor too that really influences the degree oh absolutely i don't care what you know one of these had a little ice cream parlor and i looked at the manager i said my father you know will never get out of a bed i don't care about a ice cream parlor you know if you went there and you were in your seventies and well you just went there to a you know retirement center yes you could do all that good stuff but this was more a transitional setting uh-huh i wanted him cared for and and not left uh you know if he spoiled his linens or something i did not want that exactly you know there what do you do in a hospital work with okay all right my job is as occupational therapist um a lot of what we are looking at are are skills that the person is gonna have to be able to perform to be able to live independently once they leave the hospital and we sometimes help the family make that decision if it looks like they're gonna be able to get in and out of bed or on and off the toilet with just a little bit of help then that's something that they can manage but you you're talking about an elderly spouse and when it involves quite a bit of assistance and lifting you don't want the other person right  hello hello hi hi my name's Brigette and i'm Liz nice to meet you and where are you i'm in Lubbock you're in Lubbock okay i'm in Dallas uh are you okay yeah um do you know what we're supposed i'm never am ready with that number i have to go flying around the

Caribbean although the last time we went to Nassau and and uh uh the weather wasn't good and it was mostly gambling and that really wasn't what we were there for so oh really but um but that's been a while now where i like to go is is uh Santa Fe uh-huh Albuquerque and Santa Fe skiing no no uh really just uh the weather there and the beauty and the and and driving out in nature and that sort of thing the galleries that kind of thing do you like that kind do you like really uh-huh yeah uh-huh i've been um i've been to Albequerque quite a bit just because i live close to there to go skiing and

very excited well that'll be fun yeah i mean i've i've been when i was a lot younger but i didn't really remember it but i'm going in March but i'm real excited about that that'll be yeah well the southern California and northern California are pretty different except that once you're on the coast of course it i mean being on the coast is just beautiful yeah that's but but i but i suggest some time you try to get up to San Francisco it's just incredibly beautiful that whole area really and driving if you drive if you go from San Francisco and drive north up the Pacific uh-huh uh coast that way up to up through uh Oregon and and Washington uh-huh it's just beautiful really i'm excited about going because i haven't been in so long and i really don't remember and some friends of ours just moved up to um to LA oh yeah so we'll probably go see them too and i am really excited yeah yeah how much time are you going to get to spend there um really about a little less than a week well but that's not bad is it a business trip or fun uh it's for spring break i'm in college oh good oh okay yeah so oh well that is going to be neat yeah uh you're in college in Lubbock uh-huh yeah yeah i go to Texas Tech yeah well my son uh was in college in uh near Los Angeles oh really yeah and uh he would go to San Diego Palm Springs is another neat place oh that's neat uh-huh um there and uh uh oh you get you i mean Disney World is there you up up and on the you know between the two there's just an awful lot there yeah see i know yeah did he like going to school there he liked it uh yeah he liked it a lot he happened to be there during earthquakes and uh oh no uh he loved it out there i mean he would say he loved it but he did get a little bit tired of the of the earthquakes they haven't had one in a while but they had them while he was there really so when he was in southern California they had them and then he went to visit San Francisco and was there for the big earthquake there too on his spring break gosh that would be scary that would be really scary yeah yeah but uh anyways it's you know it's it it's it's just part of it it comes with that that and smog but then again it's got weather that's neat all the time and and uh just a lot of of other things that are great so yeah see i'm so excited i think that'll be fun yeah i think you'll enjoy that so that's my vacation of the year pretty much yeah yeah what about the east coast have you ever been to the east coast um no not really no does anything interest you there um seeing New York or Boston or Montreal or see i haven't i have really never been there yeah uh my mom's from New York uh-huh but um we've never gone there you've never gone there hum-um usually if we go on vacation we really pretty much go it God to like Saint like you said Saint Thomas we've been there and like Mazatlan and Acapulco and stuff like that oh boy do you scuba dive yeah yeah uh-huh or snorkel or any of that uh-huh yeah yeah that that and and do you sail yep  so you think uh the Soviet Union's a threat anymore to US you know i was i was thinking about that while i was waiting for the connection i i think uh you know it's uh uh a military threat certainly i don't feel like it's like it was back in the the sixties whenever Kruschev said he was going to bury us um-hum uh at the same time i i think they may still be a threat in a different sort of a way in that uh the situation over there is so unstable yeah yeah and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth um-hum um-hum um-hum you know and and if things don't get straightened out over there it it will impact us one way or the other i think right right i think i'm just afraid of uh what they're going to do with their nuclear warheads that they already have right now that uh they said you know they're open to uh anybody who's willing to pay the money i think uh Ukraine said that you know if you've got the money for it we'll give you the warheads is that right i hadn't heard that yeah and uh i'm just afraid you know some some guy like Sadaam Hussein yeah or or any one of the other uh nuts that are running around yeah oh yeah i mean you could get someone like you know the guy who uh who negotiates arms you know you know he buys them out sticks them in his arsenal and starts selling them to everybody in the world uh-huh yeah well it's uh i don't know it's it's amazing to see uh the kind of changes that's happened just in the past uh you know not even ten years or even five years it's just awesome um-hum yeah yeah well you know it's i guess the break up it's self was was uh kind of unusual and then now all of a sudden you know Gorbachev who was uh in the US's pocket pretty much yeah is now gone you know and now we've got Yeltsin uh Yeltsin who seems like he's a little bit of a hard ball typical yeah typical communist yeah but even so he seems to be a much more reasonable person than than you know previous Soviet leaders oh yeah doesn't right right that's true and uh you know it's just uh uh you see this the uh you know on television the the uh shows uh on the news with the the people waiting in line um-hum uh-huh uh-huh they had last night i think it was on ABC where some Soviet doctors had gone on strike because their uh uh-huh monthly salary was about enough money to buy them six pounds of sausage with you know the new increase in prices right hm which is you know of course doctors over there aren't held in the same rare high esteem that they have here in the US um-hum um-hum well but the other thing was uh like nuclear scientists over there were being uh taken in by you know other countries you know yeah because i mean like you said they're not being paid very much over there and and whereas they can command salaries of you know twenty thousand dollars a month in uh you know these middle eastern countries that you know oil bearing countries you know and i saw that they uh Iraq and Iran had offered uh twenty thousand dollars a month to nuclear scientists i mean huh who wouldn't want that kind of money yeah yeah you know i i would even consider moving to Iraq for that i mean yeah yeah really well anyway it's but i mean and and these and these are guys that couldn't eat you know so yeah yeah well as a matter of fact i know that uh you know they they were concerned about the Soviet brain drain because there're so many of their top people just uh like you say they they so you know are are being given offers elsewhere and some of them i think are even coming to the US if we can get them you know rather than let them uh go to one of those third world countries right um-hum um-hum um-hum well i think the US is eventually going to have to step in i mean you've got this you know big country that's now uh pretty much uh in chaos because uh i mean the all the things that's split up and they've got the nuclear arsenal to you know pretty much eliminate the rest of the world and uh they've asked for US support and i think the US is going to have to give in well i'm all for them providing as you know as much support as we can at the same time you know it's time for us i think as a country to run us you know the rest of the world really is not our responsibility because yeah um-hum um-hum it's good for us to look after our own best interests even in uh you know an international way but at the same time we i don't think that we have the resources to bale out the entire Soviet Union um-hum um-hum um-hum no i don't think as far as bail out goes i'm thinking more on the sense of uh um helping them take the infrastructure they have and putting it to use i mean they've got a good infrastructure there i mean they at one time were you know they they were a threat to the US i mean they had the weapons ability they had the manufacturing capability yeah and i think it's all kind of disorganized right now you know the amazing thing about about it is how these people who've been operating for you know seventy generations under a uh uh you know the the protectorate protectorate of the the government over them that they really don't even have a concept of what capitalism is right um-hum yeah yeah and and and as a matter of fact i'm not a guy with my company was in Moscow several weeks ago and i asked him what it was like and he said you know he said they start drinking vodka at ten o'clock in the morning uh-huh um-hum yeah yeah yeah i wish there was that kind of uh stuff over here it'd be great but uh anyway it's uh uh i don't know there there just yeah yeah they've got a really uh different outlook and a different mentality than uh uh people than have anybody that has been accustomed to living uh under any form of capitalism and it's going to take quite a while for them to to realize that uh um-hum hm um-hum yeah yeah  yeah i uh i that's kind of a controversial issue here in the nation's capitol i think we're becoming known as the murder capitol um-hum and so there's a lot of of emphasize on gun control uh i'm not exactly sure where i stand because uh i feel that it may be necessary with the crime coming out this way that we'd be allowed to have the facilities necessary facilities to protect ourselves um-hum uh i do know that the District of Columbia has a gun control law and it seems that the number of shootings has gone up since they invoked the law it oh i see yeah well i but the the criminals all have guns now right well they they can get them one way or the other i i think it's uh i probably rate it maybe on the scale of one to ten maybe uh seven or eight uh i think well the automatic weapons and these assault weapons and all of these things that uh i think that is something that uh really be limited but like you say if they take uh if they have gun control control then they take away uh the citizens right to protect themselves and we live out in the west where uh of course i have a number of guns and each one of my sons have guns and we go hunting quite a bit for deer and and uh uh pheasants and things like that and uh they impose a gun control law that would really be disastrous i think because because i think the criminals will get guns no matter what uh-huh where if we were restricted from having them uh or registering them all so that everybody knows who's got them i i don't feel i think that would really take away from our our uh rights and freedoms as as citizens to to bear arms and protect ourselves if necessary yeah well we have uh well in Fairfax county it's against the law to discharge a firearm uh-huh in fact i think it's against the law to discharge a bow and arrow oh my God uh but the uh they don't have any real strong gun control law uh-huh uh whereas just over the border in the District they they have a real strong gun control law Fairfax County is fairly peaceful and uh the District of Columbia is averaging about two murders a day oh boy yeah that i i've read about that that is really tragic i don't know how you could stop that i it that would be terrible i mean you you don't even know whether you want to go to Washington DC yeah well we i fortunately fortunately work out in the suburbs with uh-huh and uh i just don't go downtown at night no and uh a little bit reluctant to go in the day time no uh-huh and there've been a few occasions uh i can remember a few years back i was downtown and uh toward quitting time i decided since i was there i'd go visit one of my favorite stores uh-huh and it was about six thirty when i left the uh store and i was walking back to my car and boy i tell you i got spooked uh-huh uh there were you know people in the alleys making noises at you and oh wow people lying around in the park and it was dark and and i i just got scared i wound up running back to the car yes you would well i know out here uh apparently they've kind of uh uh well they excuse me in the Utah area they have uh the women i guess the women and doctors they had a uh hostage situation at uh one of Alta View Hospital in Salt Lake City where uh a fellow came in with a gun and he uh killed one of the nurses and and held the hostages uh all night till they finally finally got him but uh so what they're saying now in the papers that there has been uh uh big increase in nurses and doctors that are buying guns hand guns to protect themselves yeah because of this situation that happened and it doesn't happened hasn't happened very often but uh again that's it you hate to to do that but uh we're starting to get some gangs uh they're coming out here and there's been a few shootings drive by shootings and these yeah we've we've had a lot of uh drive-by shootings we have a few people arrested for it going out and shooting just because they felt like killing somebody yeah just shooting at random i'm kind of sorry to hear that that it's happening in nice rural Utah because uh well it's it's not bad yet but uh there's there it is happened we we we had one of our uh football coaches at one of our high schools in Salt Lake City that uh i guess they were out on the practice field uh last fall and a couple gangs were involved and they shot him in the leg hm and uh it's it the police of course are are quite  okay well are you a fisher person are you yes i love to fish what kind great what kind of fishing do you do well it's mostly from the rivers and lakes in California and yes and from the banks i don't like to go out on boats oh well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods well it uh down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish and trout up at uh Lake Shasta when i go up there uh-huh oh but i like it all except uh really i don't i don't really care that much for the trout i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout well i i don't blame you i grew up in Nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the Little Blue River and then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the Missouri River uh-huh and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some uh bass fishing and striped bass fishing but uh i still uh i am sort of a catfish man at heart i see well uh like in uh Iowa and Nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh yep yeah they do you know that's what i mean cause i am from Iowa oh and uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads and that's they look just like baby catfish yeah you know uh did you get to go fishing very often oh yeah i like to fish the only problem is i just moved to Texas so it's been a little over a year now but uh uh-huh i i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here and i so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now uh-huh and it's driving me crazy but uh one of these days i will go over to uh Lake Louisville or uh what is it uh Ray Hubbard Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while uh-huh well uh you like to eat them after you catch them well yeah sure you bet because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing but they don't like to eat them well most yeah most of the time uh if we catch something we'll take it home and eat it um you know and you're right i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu yeah i know if i go to a restaurant and order fish it's usually either salmon or uh red snapper yeah you know well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish or do you fillet them out how do you how do you we skin skin them yeah yeah yeah just cut their heads off and skin them and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them do you okay yeah i don't put that corn meal on them no you know uh that's the way my mother taught me to fry them so well that's how we do it too uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and we've caught you know fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill uh-huh uh-huh and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on on tin foil uh-huh and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh we're and it really tastes pretty good yeah well you know i don't think i've ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones there uh yeah so uh well i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far it's just been on uh on the trout lines so um wouldn't that be something yeah it's a thrill when you get a big fish though isn't it yeah and uh well and up in uh South Dakota on the in the Missouri River there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh you know they really uh in in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time they'll uh give you a run for your money uh-huh so when you were when you did go fishing where did you go you moved there from where Nebraska uh-huh yeah so it was just like the rivers and uh and the lakes i suppose huh in in Nebraska yeah uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in uh-huh uh-huh and a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits uh-huh so we'd do a lot of fishing there too but uh South Dakota didn't really have much for  so we're supposed to be talking about Clo yes i'm here are you here hello hello hello i can hear you just fine are you there yeah i am now wonder what happened okay i don't know i could hear you fine yeah oh really i couldn't hear a thing well huh i was i mean the whole time i could hear you say hello and i was trying to i don't i'm on a cordless phone so i thought well maybe something happened oh gee i was on a cordless when she called but then i uh i uh never get it to work so i had to go to my other phone oh anyway we're supposed to be discussing clothing right um yes at work i guess um i work for TI yeah where do you work oh you work for TI oh okay and um it's pretty casual i mean it can be pretty casual it seems like um well with our weather that we have here in Texas that um you can usually get about three seasons out of clothing the the only stuff is sometimes i get more casual during the summer yeah um-hum and it doesn't last you know past Labor Day or i mean or what is the the one in the fall uh-huh yeah i know what you mean right yeah i uh well i work for Lomas Mortgage and um you know you know what i mean like white shoes and that kind of thing our office is so cold i usually try to wear i wear suits most of the time except on Friday we have casual day um-hum um-hum i mean we can wear jeans i'm not a jeans wearer but i wear pants but um a lot of people in the office dress fairly casual most of the time um-hum and do your suits carry you through all four seasons or do you have lighter suits that you wear uh they do carry me through yes uh most of them i can wear all year i just you know i just buy the and they're um Leslie Fay makes a haberdashery and um i can even wash them in my washing machine um-hum oh great yeah and um so they're not too heavy for summer or winter or just anytime so i i'd usually buy maybe a lighter color you know like for the summer then i won't wear the real light ones in the winter but um-hum hm um well i know that like my husband wears suits all year long but you know the men's suits seem to come in different weights like tropical weight or uh-huh you know uh i mean he wears wool in the summer but it's a lighter weight and it it it is uh a lot thinner so it breathes better than a a polyester would yeah the wool does and and i wear suits occasionally at work at but a lot of it depends on what what i've got going like if i've if i'm gonna be meeting with customers uh-huh then uh you know get all dolled up or what not dolled up but you know what i mean um but if i'm just gonna be sitting at my desk all day then yeah all right yes uh-huh i don't um you know dress up as much and it it depends on what kind of meetings i have uh-huh right yeah but um fortunately TI is flexible enough that um you know i can do that uh-huh uh-huh yeah that makes it nice yeah although right now i'm having more difficulty finding things to wear i'm expecting and and uh oh you are well congratulations i'm in that thank you i'm in that in between stage where where not showing enough to wear maternity clothes but huh oh but uh my old clothes are getting kind of tight so so i've started um uh one friend mine at work lent me a bunch of units yeah stuff you know and yeah so that'll be great to wear you know units pants with the sweaters so fortunately TI is flexible enough that oh yeah that's nice uh you know we can dress kind of casual like that although i get i get tired of it you know and i don't have uh-huh yeah i mean i had jeans and i can i used to wear on Fridays i think i've Friday has been my casual day since probably high school even through college it was just kind of ingrained in me that Friday was always a kind of a casual day uh-huh oh yeah so i do that even at work it's more it if i do wear jeans that might be the day that i wear them um-hum yeah but but they don't fit anymore well our company's our company allows jeans on Friday uh everybody wears you know most everybody wears jeans but they're real kind of particular you know what kind of jeans or what kind of shirts you wear with them they'll you know they want you to look nice and uh everybody's pretty good about  you go ahead and tell me about your last home repair well let's see my last home repair i put an office in my garage i uh took down one of my uh uh two car garage doors and i uh i made an office out of it and uh the funny thing was um it i i didn't think i needed a permit you know because i wasn't yeah i wasn't changing the the looks of the of the outside a building permit yeah um-hum and my neighbor called the uh city on me yeah he turned me in and i i was halfway done with the office oh he turned you in huh huh and uh so oh well what they did was i i called i'm a contractor myself and i'm i'm a roof contractor so did they fine you or what uh okay um-hum uh i went down and got some permits from some uh roof work that we were doing and i uh i talked to them about my you know my garage and uh so they said well you need to get a permit for this and that and you know electrical and all that kind of stuff so they here's the funny thing they said they uh um-hum they wouldn't give me the permit because they needed a uh pre inspection okay so they came to do the pre inspection and they they didn't pass it because i didn't have a permit on site yeah uh-huh oh you're kidding so how'd you finally get a permit oh we're i'm still in my office and they i still don't have one and no huh you're kidding did you finish it did you finish it uh yeah yeah and without a permit yeah that that that is funny so it's it's quite comical in fact um i'm starting in my i i'm actually not starting my bathroom but i couldn't help but start at my bathrooms i uh taking a shower one day i i uh um-hum put my hand on the on one of the tile walls to support myself and put my hand right through huh you've got to get a permit even to like remodel a bathroom well um yeah i think i yeah yeah here in in Plano that's uh yeah is that right jimminy Christmas it's pretty strange hum i didn't realize they were that stringent i uh have done a little bit of remodeling on my house i'm i'm an accountant but i sure enjoy um you know messed around and doing some things and i finished a couple rooms in the basement and i built a real nice storage shed on a concrete foundation and and uh i've never got a building permit yeah in fact i uh-huh is that right well here yeah even even uh even just putting uh little uh uh patio outside you have to have a permit i know huh yeah it's it's pretty strange i'm thinking about building a room on my house and i you know i haven't thought twice about getting a permit yeah yeah you have uh i i think things you know are are different from city to city or from state to state but um-hum well i'm not sure i think i'm supposed to have one i just never have gotten one oh maybe my neighbor'll turn me in too yeah well i i think my neighbor was a little bit uh put out because he came over to you know he he asked to to help me and he's pretty busy guy i thought anyway and i said well i've i've got my guys from work they're gonna to come over and do most of the work you know i said i appreciate your your asking but uh-huh um-hum it was funny because right the just the day after he called is that right huh yeah you know i i guess i should have let him come over and i and did my garage i mean i wouldn't have mind but i you know i thought he was he was pretty busy and uh-huh yeah wouldn't have time to do it but that's how things are well that's interesting well i know you don't have any good horror stories about home repair then because you probably uh don't have any problem if you're in the profession no actually um um-hum do you install metal roofs we do um yeah well we we don't install we we do mostly repairs we do some uh reroofing with built up roofs or or just the asphalt type shingle and uh but we do repair uh metal roofs uh-huh but but like if you were doing a residential if somebody a residential person uh house wanted you to come in and reroof their house but you do that kind of stuff uh-huh yeah uh-huh we do that yeah uh we do work we do mostly commercial stuff uh and we do work on a lot of metal roofs but we we don't install them we just uh uh repair them uh what's your opinion about those i'm my my home's gonna need to be either reshingled or reroofed in the near future we don't have a lot of heavy snow right here in Twin Falls uh-huh but uh i was looking towards getting a whole aluminum you know or metal or whatever is uh i'd be real careful extreme temperature changes uh affect the metal roofs in in what way it it expands and retracts and um just hum more so than the asphalt shingles yeah  okay uh go ahead what are we supposed to discuss again AIDS research is something that that i think that whether our country is putting enough money into it and actually i'm concerned that they're not more money less i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that he's worked worked with was professionals who came in for an AIDS uh conference in uh California um-hum um-hum and these were from other people from other countries he's a translator uh-huh and in talking to the people from France he said you know he says one of the things that really concerns me is your government's not telling you enough about how pervasive and frightening this epidemic is and they're letting the information out slowly about how hm you know how big it is which is scary you know it's pretty scary when so many people get it so i guess i'm i'm i'd like to see us spend more i don't know that spending more always gets it yeah i'm i'm ambivalent about it because um uh it uh well it is very frightening and scary i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases and uh i mean whether you mean more money for that means less for cancer or yeah yeah yes and uh whether those diseases can you some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research uh didn't uh um-hum um-hum you know but i uh then part of it's lack of education i don't know whether whether you know where our money would be most effectively spent well it i i agree with you there because i know every time that it it something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie um-hum money from money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly or do they both get served uh that's a good point and i'm i am concerned a lot about uh i'm concerned about uh two things one is preventing the spread and the other is for uh for uh treating the illness um-hum and i'm not certain i i again this i'm telling you basically i don't have any opinion but whether or not it would be uh our money would be better spent uh um-hum teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it well and one of the things i'd and i'm with you that i don't know is is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more yeah well you know the dentist whether my dentist or uh that's that's the part that that's the part that scares me you know i mean beginning with this is this is just for homosexuals well no it's for homosexuals and gays well no actually it's i mean you know did they know that all along and and i heard something the other day this sounds ridiculous about mosquitoes and you know they've been saying oh no absolutely not can't get it from mosquitoes and uh and now they're saying well maybe in the right conditions yes oh and i don't know that's true or not i mean i just heard it in passing but so what does that what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and right and how is it really transmitted et cetera which is i think what they also don't know yeah i mean that's i think they they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say you know it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble um-hum you know they just as soon not approve of anyway but but that isn't how it was in Africa no in Africa was the men and women and and had nothing to do with that and it's huge over there so i i you know and it's beginning to other countries that's was his point this was an international conference um-hum where people are saying well but in my country it's you know like this and does that mean like flus oh i mean i don't know all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know uh or maybe they understand but i think maybe more information should be given out about it yeah and uh and then the people that have it it does seem that there are are some drugs that are there that you know they keep holding back if you if i were dying i'm not sure i would care i i give me cyanide i mean is it uh-huh yeah right i'll take anything you know i mean if i'm dying if i know i'm dying you can experiment on me go ahead right exactly and why can't you why can't the FDA say you know if if these people knowingly consent to be research monkeys and well let them let them do it yeah exactly yeah yeah and that's i think what they're saying too  okay i think the first thing they said i've written this down so it would is it possible do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government okay you're asking what my opinion about whether it's possible to have honesty in government well i suspect that it is possible uh i think it probably yeah is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody right that's a good point but um other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty that's an interesting yeah that's interesting i had read something one time and it was just applying to governments in general it was written many years ago it said that is impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers and i thought that was interesting it wasn't just talking about our government it was just government in general from times past you know on and um-hum so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers but right and that would be a next question to ask how many do you think are in there for public for but because they wanna be of service to us or are they in there for their own gains and personally i feel it's probably there's probably some of each right yeah but i think maybe a lot of them um say the more honest ones who are still looking out for themselves it may be more a matter of not what can i steal while i'm in office but how many friends can i make while i'm in office and you know how good a name can i make for myself and so forth um-hum yeah so i guess it would be like anything else the president of General Motors probably has the same yeah oh yeah and they talked uh the other let's see third question was how much how much self-serving for their own gains do you think goes on then they that's hard to answer i'm sure there's a lot but i agree with you there's a lot in business i think that's just i think that's very normal i think i'm that we should not expect i mean i think we put too much on politicians we expect them to only be there to serve us you know i think a little more honesty in campaigns would be more to the point if you knew what you were getting when you voted uh yeah yeah that's a problem isn't it it's interesting because i'm taking a Texas government class right now and one of the things i always realize it's so easy to blame them to blame a lot of times i think it's our own fault they lie to us because we don't wanna hear the truth and if yeah they say you get the government you deserve if they tell us the truth we don't elect them and um-hum especially with all this front cover stuff coming up here lately about people's past and i don't know why anybody would wanna get under that scrutiny anymore it's hard to imagine because it's i think it's gotten just careless well we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life and and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at yeah and it almost seems like in order to avoid uh some of this scandal you would have to have the kind of life that you would only find in a say in the Bobsy Twins or something like that right you know i also think it'd be funny if we could know know everything about the people that were in there and threw them out i don't think there would be too many left you know so you're taking a government course at what at the university um-hum uh at uh it's TCJC Texas Tarrant County Junior College yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it oh okay and they also you know ask can we eliminate do you think we could make laws to eliminate all corruption and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally you can make laws against corruption but that doesn't eliminate it does it yeah but that doesn't mean i don't think making laws will stop it i mean i don't know how many laws you'd have to have i mean you know well they've got laws against cannibalism cannibalism but that didn't stop that guy in Milwaukee did it no sure didn't did it so no i think you can legislate but i think there's no way that you'd eliminated all by legislating and we'd end up with so many more laws that you know i mean i just think that's human nature that you're gonna have corruption in government in business personal life i mean you know actually i think other countries may have it worse uh the Japanese government is always having a some kind of a scandal usually involving the Prime Minister or people very close to him it's so uh right yeah yeah i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes but when i think about where i'd wanna go you know this is still the best or i can yeah i've been around to a few other countries and i uh i i have not found one yet that i would rather live in i think uh yeah yeah at it's worst i think we've got the best  that's it yes what do you think are possible changes in the uh the way trials are conducted these days do you like the way some people in there for instance really take over and uh we have no way of knowing whether they're legitimately right or wrong so forth yeah what do you think about these things well as i look at our trial systems i think they've gotten to be quite a joke the way that people can appeal and file for mistrials and they've taken a lot of the things that that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage i think that a jury should listen to the court uh to to the hearings and to everything but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision i think the judge should hold the fifty or maybe even forty nine and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other you you're so you're saying you you think the judge should actually have the final say i think he should and i think that there should be more than one judge there should be maybe two at least that sit in and listen so that there's no way that you could have hum like a crooked judge do you know what i mean yes i know what you mean um and i think that there it's important to have a jury but i think the way that they go through so much time to get a a fair one that's okay too as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much they need to have a fair jury but they only would you know would cover fifty forty nine percent of the decision or fifty percent and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision well how do you feel about that i hadn't uh thought of it from that point of view before i have been in a fairly important trial and uh what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand right what was being presented so that they themselves could make a proper and uh accurate decision that's the part that bothered me about it um i really think that the the the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they're guilty or not but i also think that the jury should be uh very very uh carefully more carefully selected to make sure that they are entirely intelligent intelligent people and that they understand some of the details that are involved so that they can make accurate accurate decisions right i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff and and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time that's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem right right well what if they used you know i just had a thought come as you were talking what if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials that would be certainly nice shit let's say we we would have fifty percent of them law students at any rate yeah yeah yeah at least at least on the jury and that would give them experience in the courtroom and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major um-hum that's a very neat idea and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life when they see what it is like to be in the jury side of a trial right that's right that would be a really good thing to do that would be a a really good thing to do i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial so that's hum and what happened was her husband was um involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stop light and ran into the motorcycle um but the reason the actual reason that the motorcycle person her husband was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle he was just taking it home from the place it was brand new and his brakes did not work for goodness sakes and this expensive big company that owned these motorcycles um railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened um-hum and they were following him home in the car saw the whole thing happen oh they saw the husband get that's right they were following him home from the motorcycle shop yeah and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials um this and that and the other every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of a of a settlement they'd find something wrong with it until finally they won and said that it was the drunk driver's fault and she would have to sue him did they really uh-huh which i would think it would be some his fault but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money the big lawyers and she didn't that is a shame you'd think there would be enough uh people who saw the accident other than his wife right to to also uh make statements and they have nothing to gain one way or the other so if they say a certain way then why not believe them right and i don't know all the details on that but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the the student the students coming into the jury yeah and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say um-hum  have any great vacation spots to share with me uh well most i'm fifty three most of my big vacations i think are probably in the past i've been you know to Europe a couple of times and oh boy and to where in Europe Rio huh where in Europe did you go oh okay uh England uh Holland France uh one of the interesting most interesting ones was Berlin we were there for five years and this was back in eighty five before you know the wall came down wow so that was very interesting to go into you know a Communist country and all that course it's kind of laughable now but you know that's the way it was then that's not you say you were there for five years five days i'm oh five days uh-huh five days my husband's brother was the commander of the Air Force base in Berlin uh-huh uh-huh and so we were visiting them i'm sorry i interrupted you you was always saying also saying that you'd gone to Rio yeah uh another brother all my my brothers and sisters used to live in all these interesting places uh they're all retired and back in the states now but one lived in Rio and that was that's wonderful we went there for about ten days and that was quite a beautiful place um-hum and uh so so a lot lot of your big vacations have been international to yeah and to visit relatives my brother worked lived in Jamaica for a number of years so we went there you know for a week so uh that's wonderful and do you like to travel domestically as well do you do you take vacations around the country now uh yes uh-huh in fact that's probably where we'll go in the remaining years we'll probably just stay right here in this country for some we i think we could afford more back then than we can now uh-huh we're caught in this economic crunch yes i can relate to that we also had a time share condo if you're familiar with those so we used and it was our home unit was in Vail Colorado oh yes and then if you didn't want to go there you could switch and go actually anywhere anywhere in the world and did you ski when you were there in Vail uh yeah a little but we waited we were too old when we started going to really learn the you know like our children learned well and skied well but you know uh-huh uh-huh you that's something you really i think should learn when you're younger you know you wait until you're forty five and start learning to ski well then you're afraid you're going to break something it's true it's true now i've done all the talking you tell me what you've done yours are much more exciting than mine um i think probably finances have limited us um primarily my family um because i'm the oldest when i left um my family went on some really fun vacations so it's more the things that i've done with my husband and and more recently our child that uh that we that i could probably talk about well you're much younger what age are you well i'm not actually i just started my family younger i mean started my family later um oh i'm thirty six and my daughter's only well that is young go ahead my well but my daughter's only two so at my age i think that my my mother i mean when my mother was my age i think that i was probably twelve or something like that yeah but but that was the trend back then you know you had your children in the early twenties it right at any rate we've really enjoyed camping vacations i think that that's probably the thing that we've uh done most each year probably four to seven times a year we'll take short short little vacations maybe three days maybe four days oh and there's so many places in the San Francisco Bay area that you can camp that you don't really have to go very far you can drive as little as an hour and get into a redwood forest and feel like you're just oh and such beautiful country up around you it is really nice to have that very close um there are some places up the coast near Mendocino and in Marin that have what they call environmental cabins so you can rent them fairly inexpensively and stay a couple nights and feel like you have a little beach house getaway oh so we've done that a few times too you know it's very rustic you don't you bring all your own things and you bring your your your cooler almost as if you were camping but there's a stove and there's a right a table and and uh platforms for your bed mattress and that sort of thing so it's somewhat set up those we've really enjoyed i think what i'd like to do when our daughter's a little older oh and if we have other kids its uh the kind of club made med vacations that my husband and i enjoyed several years ago because there's so many different activities um-hum and and they you can take children now can't you yes they call them club kids yeah okay i knew i knew something about that uh-huh yes they have all kinds of art activities and sports that are tailored for kids and babysitters if you have children that are you know infants  go now what kinds of things do you like to listen to good well my uh uh my interests lie mainly in classical music is that right uh-huh and uh uh uh although i wasn't raised with opera it's something that i've i come to enjoy how about yourself well actually i kind of like those same things myself and um uh i did uh study some music in school although i'm not um a musician i just took it kind of as an avocation and i sing with the Brookhaven singers over at Brookhaven College you must be familiar with that name living in Dallas right absolutely and uh they have um a lovely woman over there who um teaches singing and um has a Saturday class as well as private lessons and uh we go and we sing for some retirement homes and at the Botanical Gardens and things like that and uh really very very very enjoyable and i do try to get down to the symphony at least a couple of times a year and i didn't get down to the opera this year though but i have in the past um but anyway i do enjoy listening to especially the classical music that has some kind of a story line or a theme like Beethoven's Pastoral and things like that where you can sure follow um through some of the mood of the of the melodies and not just have um you know a kind of mathematical arrangement of the notes which is sound also fascinating many times but i like that break of a kind of a story line sometimes what kind of uh pieces are your favorites well i uh i tend to shy away from anyone who uh uh is born later than nineteen hundred uh-huh other than Aaron Copeland uh Aaron Copeland i enjoy oh yeah uh-huh uh-huh what about Gershwin oh Gershwin uh Gershwin's uh i i i uh i i haven't uh quite found jazz to be enjoyable and and and a lot of Gershwin has a a some of some of his work is a little uh has has has a touch enough enough of jazz uh um-hum um-hum that uh that uh is not particularly enjoyable for me to listen to the uh um-hum um uh uh like i i i suspect my favorites uh are in the uh seventeenth and eighteenth century uh uh musicians uh i'd um-hum uh-huh the uh oh there's one uh uh i guess more recent one with uh Copeland uh is uh Raspegie who uh i was always amazed that he was uh so contemporary uh contemporary um-hum um but i uh uh i our family gets down to uh the Myerson relatively frequently it it's our uh uh our one enjoyable uh if if we can make it to Saturday uh everything's okay um-hum um-hum uh-huh so it's uh it's a relatively busy uh activity we uh one uh very nice uh uh opportunity that we've had is the is the Dallas Chamber Orchestra uh-huh oh really that has uh uh uh actually it's it's it's wonderful they they have a Sunday matinee that uh uh if you buy two season tickets the kids go free um-hum oh and uh that gives us an opportunity to uh uh to take the to uh uh make sure the kids uh get uh get dressed up and and go to the symphony whether they want to or not and um-hum and uh and they uh their they oblige us by falling asleep so least that's pretty good how old are your children they're uh eleven nine and eight which is and it's it's nice in that uh oh isn't that wonderful though um-hum in that uh their their you their they you can get real close to the uh to the chamber orchestra and see the music and watch the musicians it's uh it's a very intimate setting and the the music's really very good um-hum i bet it is now i have never heard them um that Myerson auditorium is really is really quite acoustically beautiful i i have to admit that um i had the privilege of going to the uh piano concert that uh Yefgenya Chessum who is a young uh Russian artist gave i guess it was just before Christmas time right and i'm telling and and it was no orchestra orchestra or anything it was just he it was just a recital and yes and i'm telling you the sound the sound was so so perfect uh i i had heard you know the orchestra the symphony and we went for the toy symphony and the young children's um uh uh orchestra from SMU and oh um-hum right several things down there this is the first time i just heard like one artist and right  okay hello yeah okay hello yeah yeah well i uh on capital punishment here in Utah it uh we do have the death penalty for murder and uh the uh the either the jury or the judge can make that determination depending on the crime the seriousness of the crime uh-huh it's been uh uh it's been uh oh it's been four or five years ago since uh someone was actually uh put on death row well there's some quite a few on death row but uh before one was executed yeah that's the same way it is here and it uh we've got some that uh have been there for ten or fifteen years and i don't know my opinion on on uh the death penalty i think it's uh personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals but they appeal and appeal and uh it just goes on forever but right right it's just nothing but cost the taxpayers lots of money huh uh-huh it really does and uh uh i i have i've always felt that uh if they murder someone in cold uh in cold blood they know what they're doing and uh that they should be uh pay made to pay for it but if we don't have a deterrent of some kind then it just gets to the point where and if people it's just if they want to do it they do it and then they they think well i'll be out in uh two or three years and a lot of them are yeah and then they end up doing it again uh-huh right no i think that's very very very wrong um i'm with you i think if they if they've killed somebody they should they should pay for it uh-huh you know period no you know none of this going on and on and on and on right what if the where it's so clear cut we've had a couple cases here where they were actually caught and they uh and they had witnesses where they had killed two or three people and there was one that they thought they'd killed but they hadn't and they had the witness and and uh they did all kinds of things to these poor people uh-huh and this one they thought they had killed him but uh they hadn't and the the police were able to get them but they they did uh were able to uh have the one uh executed but the other one is still appealing and uh it's uh it's really a sad thing especially for the families of those that were involved yeah you know i don't in other countries i don't think they do that if someone does something bad like that they just uh-huh do it right now you know right and and they don't have the crime rate that we have here i know my son uh was over in Saudi Arabia but he was over there during the war and he said man somebody over there uh-huh uh they they kill someone and the and uh that's it they're killed or they yeah they pay for it right now yeah right and so he says you really don't have that he could see the crime rate was very low over there because people knew the consequences right but here it's got to the point where i think it's gone too far the other way yeah you know like like you say you know anything they do they don't care they could go out and rob somebody if they get caught they know they're just going to be out in just a little while anyhow uh that's true so it's the same thing you know but uh i just don't think that they should let it go on and on and on like they do well i know made in the point you made about the taxpayer paying for it when you start considering the cost of fifty to sixty thousand dollars a year to keep them in prison yeah right plus all the attorney costs all of that the taxpayers pay for uh-huh uh-huh and uh the victims they don't get anything other than just the heartache and going through this and going through it appeal after appeal and i don't know i yeah they make it wait for so long and then people forget actually what did happen you know uh-huh and then they find some little glitch uh in the law and uh you either turn them loose or or put them in prison for life and then maybe after a few years they're paroled yeah right right so i don't know it's it's uh quite a situation i yeah i wish they'd get back to that but uh every once in a while there was a fellow that was executed in uh Wyoming the state next to us uh about a month ago and uh of course he he said he wanted to be because he he had done the you know he he admitted to it and everything he said i just don't want to stay in prison and uh-huh so the lawyers couldn't do anything to stop that one but anyway it's uh uh-huh uh-huh it makes you wonder how they can live with themselves when they do something like that huh i well it does and then you try to teach your children uh respect for for uh  all right it's going to be a hard one huh why yeah i think so i i don't know well i'm not one in finances first of all and but i do try try to keep a family budget what about you uh-huh um you know it's it's it's a it is a hard one because we don't have a budget we barely have enough to cover what we have let alone keep a budget well that's the way with us that's why i said i try to keep one with my husband isn't working and uh yeah and and it makes it real tough you're right oh is that right that makes it real tough huh so how do you how do you make ends meet and how do you make sure that your bills are paid and well i rob Peter to pay Paul i pay the utilities and the most expensive uh biggest bills at the first of the month yeah uh-huh and then i look buy the groceries and the smaller bills like like middle of the month but i have it exed out to last me for the whole month and he works contract work occasionally so that helps he's an electronics engineer an electronics engineer huh what does he do a what uh-huh and uh he works mainly on aircraft and he was working with Eastern and Eastern uh went bankrupt oh is that right so yeah so um well that's tough yeah especially these days when uh the economy is so bad yeah i work on commission and um he he he he said he yeah and that makes it tough too because i you know you can't you can't always budget what you you know you can't have the same budget every month because uh you know uh that's true what kind of work do you do uh i am in the roofing business commercial roofing business oh uh-huh and so you know i may do real well this month but uh next month it may you know may not rain at all and we not have any work so that makes it really hard too it makes it really hard to to set any budget and uh you know so um i guess it's uh it you know each family has their own own way of doing it i i do it about the same way you do you know we pay what what needs to be paid so that we don't you know we don't have the lights turned off or have the electric water turned off or the phone turned off do you ever try to hit a long shot like in lottery or races or anything like that and no i don't um mostly mostly mostly mostly because we don't uh yeah so how about you have it to do it right hm yeah no i'm the same way i saw where um Castleberry won i was in that uh Publisher's Publisher's Warehouse i never send those either but i thought well maybe you do have a chance after all uh-huh yeah but um huh no i uh you know most of the uh most of the financial uh problems that we have you know are are things that we kind of brought on ourselves because we kind of overextended ourselves of couple of you know few years ago with uh um-hum credit cards and stuff and then the economy went bad and you know i was out of work for a couple you know for little while um and uh you know been on commissions for for you know few years and it's just um we just never got caught up so do you own your own home yes we do yeah well we do too and that makes it even tougher because you know we tried to put our house up for sale and yes harder and uh the economy's so bad we couldn't sell it yeah well when we bought the economy the uh real estate was really high and now with the last appraisal we got and everything it really went down so that if if we would've tried to go on a market we'd have lost money yeah well we did too yeah well we got we you know all we asked out of our house was the the note uh-huh and um shoot uh somebody came and and offered us we would've lost twenty thousand dollars on our home you know if we were just to sell it um-hum and uh so we decided to keep it and kind of just uh i'm trying to hang in there yeah try to make things uh work does your where does your wife work she doesn't i mean she does actually she does she actually probably works more than i do but she does sewing and hair and stuff at home oh and um so the only you know i guess bright uh uh thing that we have to look forward to is that i own part of the company that that uh i work for and and so that's kind of helping us out you know it's making things a little more um little easier because i can always count on a check on Friday yeah do you just go commercial  that proposal well actually i've i you know it kind of caught me by surprise i haven't ever really thought about uh you know mandatory public service i obviously believe in public service and you know think it's a good idea i i i i'm not sure if they would get um-hum the service they anticipate if they force it do you understand what i'm saying i mean you know you're gonna get a lot more commitment a lot more desire a lot more uh that's a good yeah good point maybe quality time effort energy from somebody who really truly wants to be there so although i believe in it i'm not sure requiring it would be the way to go um-hum you know what i've noticed at least in our in my field that that works is to require before a person can enter the school program that they do a number of volunteer hours in that field or in in an environment that's related to that field and um-hum that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them that's true if there were enough opportunities i suppose uh that would really require a lot of participation on the part of employers to require a certain number of community uh community service hours in their area that's well that or have something available in that field you know and and when you go to employers then is it really a public service um thing or more of an internship you know i don't know uh-huh uh-huh i really like the idea of young people getting a chance to to do something of a volunteer nature maybe in another country but that that's difficult for a lot of people i guess financially to to manage but it would certainly i think contribute to a person's responsibility and and sense of maturity um to recognize what other cultures and other countries go through in terms of their day to day existence if you're working in Peace Corps for example you're really gonna be able to learn those things i i definitely agree and i i had you know some family that did serve in the Peace Corps and i i always thought it was a wonderful thing um i i do think that if people have the opportunity to do it it's something that you know they won't forget it enriches your life and gives you like you said a a good understanding of uh-huh oh well what do i wanna say we take so much we we take what we have for granted you know we're very blessed in this country and and we take so much for granted because we really don't realize uh yeah we really um-hum how other cultures and other other countries live so i i definitely agree that it's it's good i just you know it i i um-hum um-hum to to require it i think would take a lot of forethought and planning if you wanna get the type of service you know that you're anticipating that you're hoping for yes it's a little challenging today too to think about being in another country where there's uh potentially political or military problems that are gonna effect Peace Corps workers if a person is volunteering yeah it's one thing because they recognize there's a minimal danger where where they might be but if you're expecting that they have to do it then you you you perhaps the whoever the whoever the organization is requiring it does assume some responsibility too that's true that's true and then i guess i can look around you know i i automatically when the uh switchboard suggested Peace Corps i kind of like you i thought international or going out of the country and i i look around though and there's an awful lot of public service that could be done within our own communities and our own um-hum you know a lot of times people say i don't wanna go somewhere else i wanna help my own community you know United United Way i want my dollars to work here something like that so that might also be a motivating factor then yes um-hum um-hum i i think it's terrific to have criminals involved in community services and i really like the idea of avoiding jail time for people who are just um um paying if you wanna call it that for minor offenses having them do something in the in the community minor offenses yeah i agree i think that's a very good idea what you said the field you're in what field are you in does it apply i i'm an occupational therapist and so it's hospital work that um i know this is true in occupational therapy as well as physical therapy there's so many people who are applying to the schools right now that they require that you do X number of volunteer hours i think it's a hundred or so before you can even be accepted into the school program to become a therapist okay so you have to do it in that field actually like if you like you i believe you do yeah you have to volunteer in a department that that provides occupational therapy or physical therapy if that's the the area you're pursuing i'm sure that there are other reasons for them wanting people to do that because a person may actually get into the program and not have a very good idea of what it is to be an OT or a PT and having been a volunteer they'll certainly see people on the job and recognize well this is really what i wanna do i wanna spend three or four years getting this experience yes that's true well and it might also make them realize jeez this isn't what i thought it was i don't wanna do this that's a good idea exactly exactly which which is which is definitely the case in  hey hi there my name is Scott where you calling from i'm Bridget i'm calling from Lubbock where are you calling from i oh i live in Dallas yep but i had i'm out of breath because i had to run to find my card because i didn't remember my PIN i haven't done this in a while it's been probably three three or four months i think oh do you oh really really yeah well we we we got on it um a long time ago but then it was down so much of the time you kind of got out of the out of the habit huh so anyway so what are we supposed to talk about i think we're supposed to talk about magazines magazines okay okay so what so what magazines do you take um i don't take any do i need to push one first okay hold on yes okay well now if you don't take any magazines why would you why would you want to talk about magazines i didn't i said it i called in and it told me to talk about i don't subscribe to any magazines do you i subscribe to lots of magazines yes my family well well we're we're kind of renowned for being big magazine subscribers do you really really so how come you like subscribing to them well because i i i have a lot of interests and and the magazines have a lot of interesting articles and and it's just my way to keep up and my wife's sitting here telling me it's because i'm a bookworm uh so she calls it a true bookworm no i like to read and so i take a lot of magazines so what magazines do you get well let's see i get a magazine called The Economist get the Atlantic Monthly i get Harpers um we get Newsweek um uh-huh uh-huh i get um magazine called Fine Woodworking um what else do we get here uh-huh um let's see then i get a bunch of magazines at the office like Fortune and Forbes i also oh i get the New Republic here at the house as well i read Business Week um uh-huh goodness so i don't know we i'd probably some and sometimes i take them for a while and then sometimes i i you know i'll let them lapse and then i'll get something new uh-huh so you get a well you get a lot see i'm in college so uh-huh i usually get mostly business magazines so so all the magazines i ever see they're just advertising so i don't ever subscribe to them so but that's good though yeah yeah do you are are you in school out at at out at Tech really which year are you in out there uh-huh yeah i'm gonna i'm a senior yes i love it do you like it well how'd you get on this uh TI thing then see my parents are from Dallas and they started in and they sent it to me and so that's how i got started uh-huh oh okay so i thought well i can do this you know yeah well it's not too hard but i i've called in a couple times but then like i said it was down so much that i got out of the habit and then i'm not usually home so i'm not usually here when when when when they try because i don't i haven't done it very often when they try and call yeah yeah i just started so i'm always like now what do i do i'm always like what i don't but didn't you have to fill out a form where it said that you would check off magazines and stuff on it yeah but i didn't know they'd ask me if i subscribed to them i can talk about magazines well now what magazines do you like to read um hm see i really i mean i don't even read i don't even grab mine or even look at them well if you had a hundred bucks and you couldn't do anything except spend them on magazines what magazines would you would you get would you would you buy well i think right now i'd buy Bride because i just got engaged so i'd buy that oh really those magazines are like phone books aren't they they're like two thousand pages of advertising uh uh of ads or something in them i know they're huge i know i think i'd buy like Home and Gardens and stuff like that yeah i like stuff like that really really really i used to get like a horse magazines and stuff i used to show horses so yeah really that's neat so you see a lot of horse magazines but that was quite a while ago there so did you did you uh um uh uh ride them and stuff what do they call it Dursege and yeah i used to ride them English uh-huh hunter jumper um-hum well that's good so i used to get lots of magazines for that but every since i stopped at that and went to college and i really haven't got any more magazines for that uh-huh um-hum um-hum my but those are probably the only two magazines i'd get well you could buy an awful lot of Bride magazines for a hundred dollars i don't know it it i know that's right we have some newsstands here in Dallas you know that have like thousands of magazines and i could buy a lot i could buy a lot of magazines uh-huh you get a lot of them that's great though well there's more that i could get that's great though because especially with business though because i know like with business stuff because when they first asked me this i was like well God i they're like why do you like articles or or why do you not like magazines i was like because it has so many advertising but business ones don't really and they're really informative um-hum well they have a lot of they i don't know they have a lot of different different kinds of ads and stuff in them yeah but they're very they're very informative informative i think that's great yeah i guess so what are you majoring in out there um i major in psychology in family studies yeah really that's good i like it a lot i love it up here i like it better than Dallas you you you like Lubbock better than Dallas why yeah uh because people are so much nicer yes really well people are nice here in Dallas uh it's just a different atmosphere i think you don't think so huh where'd you go to high school i went to Birkner High School in Richardson oh my son goes to Richardson High School  well have you had to return any uh merchandise recently yeah i did i just had to return a pair of shorts i bought for Christmas a winter pair of shorts and the seam was out on the the zipper went out on it right away pulled out yeah and the buttons were loose on it and it was from you know a nice department store yeah it's interesting it's interesting i really hadn't even given any thought at all to things like buttons and seams but and um i guess i've just begun to take that for advantage that buttons are not gonna be sewn on i mean took that for uh granted that buttons are not gonna be sewn on very well i guess that's true but it you know you think back and you didn't have to do replace buttons or anything yeah well you're right you're right very long ago it wasn't yeah yeah no i i agree with you but anymore it's pretty common that you do but when the zipper went on this one i said that's it yeah uh-huh that you know that really did it yeah one of my pet peeves is uh neckties uh neckties you know they're just uh uh a nice silk necktie is astronomical yeah um-hum right and it has this little um you know sewn on bar on the back of the tie that you tuck it in you know after you've tied it and those little those little some of them bars will inevitably come loose loose loose um-hum um-hum i know they hang they hang and it drags it just drives me crazy i mean it's an integral part of the tie and it wouldn't take you know what a half a penny of good thread to put it on there securely so um anyway yeah that's uh that's yeah i know it right yeah yeah there are a lot and and how about uh any appliances i've had that happen with Sunbeam no i'm disgusted i have a Sunbeam beater that we've taken back three times and Sunbeam always had a good name yeah now that just really shocks me but i'll tell you that thing hasn't i burnt the motor out twice and i cooked once at Christmas so that's about it anymore well yeah but i bake and i'm very disgusted with them yeah i i will i will tell you my experience with appliances Joan has been that uh well what happened to me i had a a stereo um-hum that i uh um receiver receiver amplifier that i really liked and it started messing up so i took it to the shop and the minimum charge to even look at it was fifty bucks um but i you know rationalized and i thought well even if i spend you know seventy five dollars that's cheaper than buying a new one so i wound up spending the nearly a hundred dollars on it yeah sure um-hum took it home it worked maybe two weeks and exactly the same thing happened to it so i took it back to the shop um um uh-huh and you know bottom line is i went through all this gyration and and aggravation and unhooking it and hooking it back up and hauling it back and forth to the repair shop um-hum eventually it never worked right again and i i wound up buying a new one i had similar i had a similar thing happen with a television and i'm about i i just came to the conclusion with electronics anyway huh huh huh right you know if they break throw them away go get a new it and go ahead and get a new one anyway you got a lemon yeah you know and and i think you're better off in the long run just to chunk it and get a new one but i i will have to say you know if you think about things like uh yeah yeah yeah but yeah as much as stereos for example i can remember the first one i bought whenever i was in college i mean i paid a fortune for it um-hum and you had it forever though well that's true as a matter of fact my i gave the amp to my little brother and he's still using it yeah that is true i'll have i'll have to admit but they have come down in price but there again they're they're made a lot cheaper right right yeah yeah yeah they've come a long way with the difference in the i heard an interesting thing on this morning on the radio to going to work about the Japanese you know they have that big thing about the consumers uh-huh and how many more hours they work on it and um they were saying that they did a study on it and the Japanese actually uh i mean the United States actually produces six point five percent more product in the time um more products than Japanese do and the Japanese take twice as much time and work but they don't get the productivity productivity out of it uh-huh and that they do because of the hours they put in that that's what they loose they loose and i thought it was very interesting and they said in the and the unique part of it is that the Japanese are the ones that um did the study it wasn't as though we were doing it to show them they did the study so i got i got got a big kick out of that one so yeah so yeah and i i agree with you if we had done it i would have felt maybe it was biased which that's a terrible thing to say but well i don't know it's um it we're living in an interesting time i mean certainly the Japanese have shown that yeah yeah yeah yeah you know they can really produce some quality merchandise and at the same time um um-hum i think what it's forced uh American manufacturing to realize is that they're gonna  have you snow had any snow up your way no we haven't had any since uh oh just before Christmas and uh we got a lot before Christmas the ski resorts were really excited and uh but now uh um we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no uh no snow um the snow's all melted off the mountains uh well i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills uh mountains in uh Utah uh guess this last weekend and she had uh quite a bit of snow on the ground her way uh-huh i guess there there's different parts of the state of Utah that that that does have some but uh not usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts and they're down between thirty eight and uh forty inches um this time of the year and uh we've been in a drought for the last five years this is the sixth year and it's getting quite serious as far as water next summer yeah well the weather uh here is always a topic of conversation in Texas right but uh we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather but we have our share of cold weather as well the uh temperature this morning was right at freezing it didn't stay there but it was oh well that's that's different isn't it right at um we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the uh end of January but this year it wasn't bad at all i guess that's because we had so much rain i know my son was telling me about the rain down there he said yeah well it just and we read in the newspaper southern part of Texas i guess oh yeah flooded out well my uh my sister lives in Houston and they uh the river there was uh in the flooding stage near where her son lives and that uh caused some uh concern of course they have a uh lake cabin and uh their dock was completely under water on the lake oh wow so we really had a lot of rain yeah my son in Plano he lives fairly close to there's quite a wash that goes down uh through Plano right and uh there's walking trails on both sides a walking path and uh when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that but uh that was clear full and up to up to some of the streets i guess it just gets yeah we had a lot of flash floods in the area we had a few people who ran into uh water and a few fatalities just uh just uh a few not more than ten um-hum that's funny that uh we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much but seems like well the uh there's an old profane expression about Texas weather it's always too damn cold too damn hot too damn windy yeah well it's uh interesting uh i'm going down to El Paso next week and uh i was wondering what the weather was but i imagine that if it's that cold in Dallas it well El Paso won't be cold it's not a doesn't get that cold i guess huh no it's it's quite southern and it's it's rare to get real cold in in El Paso the uh you'll be flying in there yes well uh take off is uh fun from El Paso because you normally the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain the Rockies uh-huh yes and they're towering above you and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again right yeah we're kind of used to that here in Utah of course there are mountains and i fly into Montana a lot and we have a the mountains are are really uh high and a lot of places we go into you just kind of uh it's in the little valley but and i uh sure hope we we really need the moisture i hope we can get uh get some there's supposed to be a storm but it split went down through uh northern Arizona and southern Utah and well they're not predicting any for the next uh week anyway up here so well i noticed on the weather map on uh cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way but i guess it didn't pan out huh yeah well that's that's what the went above uh some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana so that just left us we got a high pressure hm system that's just been sitting in here and uh we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had uh you know airport's been shut down uh till about noon everyday and they they seed the clouds or seed the fog to try to oh boy um-hum to get the airplanes in and out huh well we uh had a bad siege last uh Christmas a year ago we went up to visit my wife's uh sister who lives in uh Calgary Alberta Canada um-hum  okay what are you are you doing anything in Utah on recycling well in uh our particular area uh we're not other than uh they have a local store that you can take uh bottles and cans and different things to um-hum in their parking lot and uh in the winter we haven't been doing that but uh they don't uh that's about all they're doing is it a small town yes it's a rural area that makes a difference uh here in Dallas they're trying to uh-huh to start some curbside recycling i think they're doing a test uh personally my husband and i do plastic and glass and newspaper and cans but we have to uh take them you know to to areas and the problem that i'm finding is that uh a lot of the places i've been taking things have now discontinued the recycling policy like it's hard to find a place to take newspapers anymore um-hum yes so that's uh that's basically what happened up here and then uh with all the recycling the price of aluminum cans went down oh really yeah it used to be about sixty cents a pound and so people were collecting them and taking them in to recycle uh to get money for them now it's down to about nineteen cents a pound well i noticed a difference uh we go to the Kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents yeah that's that's what's happened and i don't know if that's from recycling i i understand it is but here uh we do we do recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts and they uh they're able to make some money uh that way but i have a son in Illinois who uh they pick it up they have a a recycling uh garbage uh pick up where they have different uh receptacles where they put it in they have some for the cans some for the bottles and newspapers and then they have the regular garbage and uh um-hum this truck comes before the garbage truck and picks uh and has separate bins to put all the glass and the plastic and all that in that seems to be working quite well there that's uh in uh Illinois well you know what is so sad is that people are finally i think willing to do something about this and then all of a sudden uh the the demand isn't there you know it's too expensive to recycle but i personally feel that we're going to have to yes uh-huh pay the price you know whether the government subsidizes it and i'm you know i sorry to the government government get involved in too much of anything else like that but something has to be done we're just uh we're using our natural resources we're filling up the dumps and yeah um-hum well i've that's what they in the local the local paper here they were talking about that uh half about half the uh the material in the dumps is newspapers um-hum they could recycle that uh more than they do then uh um we'd be able to save a lot of trees and everything else so i've been i i i'm all for it i just don't know uh i know my son uh in Chicago where he has this they have uh uh they have to pay extra to have them pick it up even though and and so that's kind of a a burden on my uh my son even though they they put it in different containers they still have to pay extra money to do uh-huh well and i know uh too my mother lives in a rural area also and it she would have to go like thirty miles to recycle anything and so course so of course she she doesn't and plus uh it's difficult for her to and uh um drive around just all that much so in a case like that you know they have to make it a little bit easier for people yes they do to do that yeah um-hum and um i'm hoping that they do this curbside recycling i'll be willing to pay a little extra you know if they'll go ahead and pick it up quite frankly it'll save me money in gas running around all over town right yep boy that's true and i take my uh paper i always get paper bags and i take them back to the grocery store and use them again hm right so you know little bit here and little bit there i guess it all helps yeah yeah it it really does if we could just get uh people uh all over to do it now i know in uh south of us about a hundred miles south in Utah they do have a uh area where uh they bring all the garbage in and they uh they do have places to recycle and they really encourage this and uh you can bring it and you have different areas um that's a small yeah well it's next to Provo Utah i don't know if you're familiar with Utah at all but anyway not a lot but i've heard the name Provo before it's where Brigham Brigham Young University is uh this okay uh there they seem to be having success and but it is a uh it's done by the it for profit making for these people um-hum and they of course are  uh yeah what what have you thought anything about another another car yes i have a nineteen eighty one Volvo station wagon with over a hundred and fifty thousand miles on it it's about time to start thinking isn't it yes and so uh i've actually been looking around and then then things got too busy and it's too complicated out there so isn't it a pain to look for cars i i hate it i really do as a matter of fact i've got my car is uh i have a an eighty seven Lincoln yes yes uh-huh and uh i just put it in the shop about oh two weeks ago and just spent about twelve hundred dollars on it i decided to get everything that's wrong with it fixed new brakes new shocks new mufflers and all that because i'm going to keep it till it dies well that that's kind of uh i was the brakes didn't feel like they were working and uh people uh people were saying you know don't you get rid of it every three years and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like get a loan then you've got to do these you've got to investigate it you've got to check all these things does it have that you you know you can't just go to this dealer you really need to check them all and you can't fall in love with one you've got to be able to turn your back on and then by the time everyone had given me their advice i thought you know this car turns on every morning i think i'll just keep going i know it well and the other thing is too uh it it's just i mean the the prices the way the prices have gone up in the past four or five years is uh it just unbelievable yes yes right no that's right and and uh the only thing i need is uh i'm not really into cars so i just need something to get me somewhere yeah yeah and i wanted an air bag i thought that would really be a nice thing to have Volvos are safe cars the other thing is i drive all parts of town uh-huh and all of sudden the idea of driving in a newish looking car made me much more vulnerable to something happening to it than the car i'm in uh-huh i understand that i i do i understand that so so so again i think well now wait a minute besides which i get a more expensive i mean a you know a new car i pay more in taxes uh-huh and insurance insurance insurance yeah and right right well i've i really have uh you know like i say i i feel like i have made a commitment now to drive the car that i've got which you know and and and after i will admit after i had those repairs made on it i felt like you know it felt like it was new again um-hum like a good car right yeah and i was very pleased with the money i had put into it which is odd that i ever walk away from spending any money on a car that i felt good about but in um-hum that you felt good about yeah but in this particular instance i did because everything felt like they just tightened everything up somehow but uh but i had decided kind of you know just without really giving it a whole lot of thought yes yeah yeah that when i do buy again uh i bought this car that i've got new but probably what i'm going to do sometime in the future is uh i'm going to look around for a good clean used car a year or two old yes that's exactly what they told me they told me too they said you should get it two years because i don't know because the price has come down that much in the two years yeah yeah and and uh X number of miles you know or like eleven thousand miles i can't remember i mean people had all these formulas i just felt intimidated so intimidated well and let you know on on note i think anyone you talk with is going to have a different viewpoint on automobiles and really and the other thing is too i i don't think that it what what yeah yeah is true for one person may not necessarily be true for another because other you know so many different people have different needs and and and desires as uh as far as cars are concerned but uh um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah it's just the the kind the i know if i go out to buy a new one i mean i know what kind of money it would take to do it and i just don't want to pay that much money uh-huh and yeah well the that's my feeling too and eventually they'll be coming out with cars that you know have much better gas mileage or use different kind of gas which is something that matters to me so um if you know if i can keep this one going i mean then uh you know i even considered leasing they talked about leasing i looked into that and then that you know then no it doesn't it makes sense for this kind of thing but not for that yeah i leased one car oh you did yeah i did that one time i had a i got an eighty five or rather it was a uh well it actually started to lease an eighty four and it was a three year lease uh-huh you know the only thing about it is i mean it was simple to get into and it really wasn't bad to get out of uh-huh but you pay that money every month and then you're finished with it and you don't have nothing to show for it granted if you had yes yeah you have nothing left yeah spent that money buying one you still wouldn't have much to show for it but you would have at least a little right right yeah so it's it you know i i think it depends i i i guess there's certain instances that that could be the best thing to do but i don't think i'll go that route again yeah well and people told me if you're the kind who buys a new car every two to four years that your  what kind of music do you like well i i like uh i guess it would be easier to say tell you what kind i don't like i don't like hard rock uh but other than that i i like just about every kind i i'm not real crazy about modern uh country and western i i like the old uh uh country western songs that i grew up with uh San Antonio Rose and uh the Sons of the Pioneers Cool Water and that sort of thing oh now that i don't know well see you're not as old as i am either that or i didn't listen to Sons of the Pioneers i've heard about yeah uh in fact i have a friend who uh plays hammered dulcimer and sings uh yodel cowboy yodeling songs and she talked um-hum talks about Patsy Montana i think you know who that was no no well that she she that was i gather an old cowgirl who used to um-hum sing songs like that yeah and i i like the old Hank Williams songs uh-huh uh-huh but uh the modern kind it seems to me it all sounds just pretty much alike pretty much like like rock um yeah well or or or just too similar to each other it's hard to tell one song from yeah it's hard to tell one song from the other yeah yeah too too be truthful with you i'm sort of a Beethoven and Bach fan well i like all of that i like classical i when i look at my tapes it's hard to tell i like Celtic music i like classical um-hum i like uh some of the new age music um-hum i like uh blues uh um-hum Muddy Waters people like that i like uh uh what else do i have folk music um-hum i like folk music a lot yeah i have a good friend who grew up in Mexico she's been in this country oh about twelve fifteen years and uh uh she gave me a tape uh of some Spanish music oh what is that dance with the ladies in the long dress and the fans uh oh you mean uh flamenco oh yes that's beautiful yeah flamenco it's modern day flamenco music yeah flamenco's beautiful yeah and it's really different and it's really pretty yeah yeah well that that i like and i used to live in Mexico so i like i like Mexican music to a certain extent just because because it reminds me of that time um-hum um-hum and then uh um do you play anything well there're two schools of thought on that you mean yours and everyone else's yeah uh i i played in the band in in college i played the clarinet B flat clarinet uh-huh uh-huh and then uh i took a semester as an elective i took a semester of class piano and i have a piano and an and an organ not a very fancy organ wow but it's an old Hammond uh-huh uh and uh i i can sight read most church hymns and uh oh the First Movement of Moonlight sonata that goes of course very slowly uh and do you do it do you play no not as on a regular basis yeah uh i that's going to be my retirement activity if i can ever ever retire well i and get back and get back into trying something with music huh yeah i i do sing in my church choir oh you do yeah oh well that's great yeah so so i i i do keep up to that extent yeah do do you play any instruments no well i played the piano you know as a child uh for years and then quit and then kind of enjoyed it and took the guitar and played the guitar a little bit and i can sight read uh and we have a um-hum piano my son was a percussionist and so he has we have a marimba and a drum set if i were to take anything i think i would take drums i just loved it when he did that um-hum yeah in in fact one time uh i bought a a two hour session with his teacher for a um lady who said she would had always wanted to go and just play all of those percussion instruments that you see including the gong the big big gong um-hum and so he let us into the percussion room and we got to play on every single instrument listen let let me tell you what my uh my retirement job's going to be what uh i've just been to the Meyerson one time and the first part was oh Schubert and you know the usual stuff and then there was this very modern day uh-huh piece that had no rhythm no tune and just sounded like a bunch of racket uh-huh and in the the middle of the stage was this box about oh four by four by four covered with black black what i have no idea uh-huh  okay you think health benefits probably the the most important yes for because most people are aging getting older and the benefits uh the benefits are going up i mean the price is going up that's true that everything seems to go up that that's the case or the problem i have i'm getting older and uh the wife and uh we use the doctors more have um more health problems and that is a very important benefit that uh yeah see here where well here where i live all the benefits have been going up lately up on health and there are hospitals that have we have a one cent tax and then what um-hum now Bush is coming up with this health plan so i don't know much much about it then no i've i haven't really studied that too much but uh that is one of the benefits that uh that i feel that uh is real good with uh the company i work for so far but uh it it's uh you know what's gonna happen their costs keep going up as you say and it's uh it could wipe a a family out or uh all your savings and everything one one serious illness yes yeah one illness will do it i think that's uh one of the benefits that we really need to our companies need really need to take a look at because there's so many Americans that are not covered at all that's uh quite a situation i think the other thing uh security and that that's getting pretty tough now a a a job with security yes uh especially if you're in uh department of defense or you're in the auto industry been working for fifteen or twenty years and all of a sudden uh because of changes in Europe this uh holidays holidays so many people are losing their jobs and uh i don't know how you can as as a benefit how you could have have security as one but most people like to have that security in their jobs yeah i would i would think so well that's one of the main main i would think one of the main securities that you would need is health benefit um-hum i'll say yeah it really is and uh it's uh you really feel sorry for those who don't have it or they have a uh cancer or something real serious that uh could runs up their uh transplant heart transplant or something runs up into uh um hundreds of thousands of dollars yes that could wipe you out in a hurry well we i have my sister died and she had some benefits that helped through her well they had her hooked up and everything but that helped her helped us through it good good good a good thing that uh they she had those i think there's other uh well there's other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that really uh give you some time off and uh that's something that uh each company's a little different on that but most of them are pretty good on those uh those type of benefits i think um-hum just just with the benefits going up it's just there's not a whole lot you can do about it really no there isn't and another one i think is uh quite important of course is retirement system that they they have yes and uh with social security and uh the way it is if that's all you got is social security by then you're not gonna make it very far right by the time i get up there uh in a few years and uh draw social security with the cost of living uh that benefit is just really not gonna help very much no i don't think that would uh the older the older you probably you would probably need more help um-hum because you know a lot of elderly most of the elderly people don't have the money and the ones that do well they have insurance so no um-hum yeah it's it's just a i think it they need to extend them because we're we're paying here a lot um-hum yes and i think the elderly needs it more than anything that's true and uh it seems like it goes up every year you have no control over the the cost to you and that just takes away your buying power also and uh the company of course i can see the company's side uh too because uh they have to pay uh an a proportion of whatever the the health cost is and it gets to the point where uh they're not uh making money and uh yeah it uh i don't wanna see us to go socialized medicine like they are in England or places like that no but still uh i i hope that this plan that uh the President's come up with uh is gonna help all those or help some way bottom line though who's gonna pay for it really have they got it have they already signed that or that's not signed yet is it no no he he just uh proposed it and uh the republicans are saying hey it's a great plan the democrats say it's no good so well they  well the topic's about government um i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic um i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and um how many people are self-serving yeah um-hum i mean that you i i think people tend to think that the government is not corrupt and that people aren't self-serving um-hum uh-huh um-hum i mean that's what i would like to think yeah i i i think that the last uh part of that question was particularly interesting um about um uh uh can all unethical behavior or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal um-hum uh because it it it seems to me that when uh government or public service of any kind degenerates so much that you have to have so many explicit ethical codes um parallel to the legal codes that uh we're focusing on the wrong thing maybe um-hum um-hum yeah maybe maybe that's what is happening maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past you know ten to twenty years that uh right it becomes more evident perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or you know etcetera like that and we um-hum we're just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons and i couldn't help thinking when that last question it was a funny question when that last part of the question came about how how many um-hum um-hum things can we um actually put a legal code on that um uh how how much um um-hum should it be our uh prerogative to see into the private lives of these people you know um yeah yeah that makes sense because you pry start prying in people's private lives you ruin their lives as well as and sometimes you know i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes you know i mean i guess in some cases sure we care about what they did in the past but uh that's right yeah um-hum sometimes i don't know it i think it gets in the way of the better judgement i mean just because he did something in his past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician um-hum i i i agree with that and um and also that if the results that they are putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by legitimate means is what's um-hum you know going to the public then um um-hum then they'll pay for their private life in their own private conscience and uh uh you know when it becomes public though it becomes scandalous that's right um-hum yeah the the that's that's the thing that um it it things that um-hum you don't know uh do do do not worm their way around then and influence other people or perhaps lead other people astray people could say oh they do it so i guess you know but as soon as things do get public um-hum yeah um-hum um there there is that terrible concern so sometimes i ask myself what are um people doing that are in the media um-hum when somebody you know comes up to office it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them and get it all over the headlines um-hum oh yeah it's i guess it's what sells newspapers you know it's a very low way of living um so and and and and as far as um um um-hum um-hum um-hum you know myself having any particular personal uh knowledge or insight into politics or politicians it i'm not terribly involved in it just in a very cursory way i vote and i you know try to do whatever i can on a little local area but i i it it just is not one of the things that i have uh placed um um-hum right hm and uh a lot of my particular time and effort into so i i always feel very yeah outside this kind of um this kind of an issue but um um um-hum yeah i'm kind of the same way i just kind of read the paper follow-up on people i mean just you know keep an eye on what's going on but i don't really play an active role in any kind of politics yeah um-hum um-hum yeah right yeah uh um um-hum i'm not i'm not in there i'm not one of those uh you know volunteers that's there at headquarters and whatever um although i admire the people that do that and they certainly do get inside information and um of course the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind of thing um-hum right um-hum the more you can trust their their judgment and their insight but the media insight as you said i just kind of read and right um-hum kind of be aware and then uh i don't like to make a whole lot of um judgment my myself unless things are so absolutely out of whack that uh yeah yeah yeah  Mike the subject is almost laughable is there such a thing as an honest politician well that's uh debatable if if you read the paper every day looks like there's a new scandal breaking ever ever minute uh oh i agree with you it's amazing Will Rogers who was in the twenties and thirties if you hear the guy that gimmicks him and uses his same material it is pertinent today as it was then yeah it is that guy that does the traveling show that's that's on Broadway and everything now uh yeah um-hum yeah that's supposed to be great i don't know as long as there lawyers making up the majority of the state legislatures and the national Congress uh i don't see a lot of change happening attorneys yeah did you catch that the defensive driving course you can take to get out of a ticket was recently changed from two years to once every twelve months it was also noted in some journal that the percentage of ownership of the driving schools by legislatures has greatly increased isn't that funny how that just happens to be a correlation yes yes they're not down there to to live off the salary of uh what they're paid i'm afraid not unfortunately and course you know the the famous joke is Japan does so good in business because they only let ten attorneys a year graduate each year and that's if fifteen had died the year before and right i saw a a lawyer joke book the other day and it and the title of the joke was skid marks and of course there's a major joke about skid marks and lawyers yes yes uh but uh i don't know it just it's pretty disgusting every time you it it's not just the unethical part of it it's the self-serving part of it um-hum um-hum that bothers me about the politicians they're all out either for a particular controlled interest group of some kind or maybe several uh and rather than really honestly decide issues on the basis of what is good for the country everybody decides them with this the constituency in mind or or afraid that they're gonna hack off the wrong group or the other vote wise um-hum and won't get reelected and yeah exactly and so we if we just limited terms senators especially i agree with you a hundred percent and even Supreme Court judges this appointing them for life is just absurd they wind up senile old men making decisions at eighty years old oh i think all the way uh all the way down to dog catchers of the city yes sir limited turn just just say that the most you can serve is a couple of terms and then get in there and then you could get in there and do the best possible job that you really feel like you should be doing and then you're out of there and go on to something else instead of this two two um-hum um-hum you go to you know get elected to another office and let somebody else pay you because this exactly well at least you'd decide things you'd decide things from the stand point of what's best hopefully for whatever agency you're representing uh you seen the benefits that yeah the benefits legislatures uh state and senate and uh and legislatures in Warshin get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life yeah i know oh uh uh have have you ever noticed when i just i just think we ought to we limit the President why not terms of the others and give there's plenty of other qualified people to run what right they tried that in in Washington or was it or Oregon but speaker of the house was from there um-hum and if approved it he would not have been eligible to continue representing and being speaker and so the voters voters kicked it said no we we since we're the one with the with the gun right now we're not gonna vote out having the gun control having the power exactly hm so when i i don't LBJ's a perfect example of how somebody can be broke and get into politics and come out rich as yeah that's right and above nothing either starting with Duvall County well they they used to say in advertising that the textbook example of good competitive advertising advertising is Hertz and Avis rent a car commercials number one number two i guess LBJ has to be a textbook example of politician without any morals yep yeah that's that's probably true i don't think one of the question question was could they legislate laws to keep politicians honest my opinion no because they won't pass laws against themselves i haven't yeah i don't well that's it when the very people making the laws are gonna be the ones who would have to pass those uh against themselves it it sort of uh goes without saying that it'd be awfully awfully tough unless you could get the best thing that could happen uh to the state legislatures would be to be full of just independent independent independent businessmen or just businessmen working for companies that could somehow get their salary made um-hum let them uh justified you know or brought up to whatever over the state salary level uh um-hum  okay this subject is magazines what do you like and what do you dislike about magazines well i like them because i can read them at my convenience and i don't like a lot of the ads i get in them especially those stupid cards that fall out of them all the time that's my main complaint on magazines too and i get magazines some of them are just pictures and advertisements uh Life magazine is like that i quit subscribing to that it's just uh magazine i mean pictures and um advertisements what is your favorite magazine oh i like the magazines like uh the home remodeling magazines like Home or Decorating and Remodeling things like that because you can see what other people are doing with their houses and maybe you could do it in yours um-hum you like to do remodeling in your home yeah we've learned how to do a lot of things on our own for instance what are you doing now anything in particular uh no not right now um i haven't gotten any magazines that have shown me anything lately what other kind of magazines do you like well i like Reader's Digest we get that and my husband subscribes to Scientific American i think he's a frustrated doctor because he uh reads constantly we have a person in our area that uh his little girl was diagnosed as as terminal and uh he came across an article about leukemia so he had me fix up the make copies of it and give it to them and tell them that there's hope for her and all this hm how many different kinds of magazines do you subscribe to well right now i i dropped People but we have uh Better Homes and Gardens Scientific American and um uh what's the other one i think it's Ladies' Home Journal or Redbook something like that i used to get People but it cost too much so i had to quit taking it did you enjoy it uh sometimes they'd have good articles but a lot of it was kind of uh a lot of fluff and not a lot of substance and it and it like i said it cost a lot of money because i think they came every week or something like that so it was a lot higher than the monthly magazines yeah my husband likes to read sports and fishing magazines all the time that's pretty boring to me do you get those as subscriptions oh he gets one to uh fishes hm what's it called Stream Field and Stream that's what he gets hm but that's the only one but he'd get more if he could when my husband was younger he liked Outdoor Life he thought that was a pretty good magazine i don't think i've ever seen that one i don't know if they still do it or not i don't know my it might not be because it's been a while you know what i really hate about magazines is those smelly cards that have perfume or cologne what's that with the scratch and sniffs the well the ones aren't they're not scratch and sniff anymore the the one kind i'm talking about you open it up and the fragrance is just there it's like a fold that's glued shut but usually oh when you get the magazine the whole magazine smells like that fragrance and you can't get the smell out and it and sometimes it makes you have a headache because it's so strong what magazines are those i don't know if i've ever seen one in mine or not well they came in People and a lot of times if you buy like the fashion magazines the Cosmopolitan or the Glamour or or Elle those type have have them in oh i don't get those i don't get them on a regular basis but sometimes i've bought them hm do you have any pet uh magazines no we we have two dogs but no magazines come in uh regarding pets at all do you like the Reader's Digest when the in their uh theirs they're kind of interesting they have the uh i like Reader's Digest but i usually borrow my parents' of that because they get it so i didn't have to subscribe oh oh so you get away easy huh yeah well a little bit but i like the they're interesting and plus i like to read through the in the anecdotes and the jokes and things on those sometimes the book excerpts are good too but mostly i like the other articles yeah and i like the vocabulary section in that yeah i like that too sometimes you can get a pretty good uh and sometimes the real definition is something totally of opposite of what you thought it was yeah doesn't that blow your mind away when that happens that's something and sometimes i like the true to life stories but sometimes they get too melodramatic like what do you mean it seems  we're talking about taxes taxes right you think you think you pay too much all right well you is what they said and do you think you'd get what you pay for that's hard to say you know i think it take a lot for granted you know and it's the the quick answer i think would be that you pay too much taxes you know but but i think if you think about it yeah um all the highways we have all the uh federal programs we have whether they're good or bad um sure seems like you do get a bang you know it seems like a lot of stuff's going on even though every paycheck a lot of money's coming out um i don't know i don't know it seems like so i used to think that government spent too much and they probably do but you know when you go to your doctor your doctor's private also and uh they're gonna charge you a good buck for whatever they're doing also so well what do you think right well i really feel in some areas that uh i agree i don't think any of us like paying taxes i think in some areas we could do better in a private sector i think it just i've done some reading on this and some and in some of the areas you know you're lucky to get back a a dime on a dollar on some programs uh but i also know that people to me won't do what they should do to help each other and they wouldn't have so much government if we did and uh we get you know gets forced into it i think socialized medicine's coming which i hate to see but i think because there's so many people without insurance that's what's coming you know it's coming yeah it's needed uh-huh so uh but no i don't probably feel like i get back what i pay now you do you pay state income tax in yeah i i pay actually state city and federal yeah see here a lot of people think in Texas we're lucky because we don't pay um state income tax but they get us in other ways you know and yeah well i i just figured it out today i get uh i think my my two week pay is sixteen hundred and eleven dollars or something like that sixteen sixteen something around there and my take home after taxes is about eleven um yeah so five hundred dollars every two weeks comes out you know and obviously if you make you know forty thousand dollars a year you're paying ten thousand in dollars a year in taxes and everybody who's in that type of income is paying that yeah i think that's another problem you know plus sales tax right uh yeah well that's where they got us here you know every time they need something they up the quote user's fees or the sin taxes you know on beer and such sure sure and plus you pay if you buy cigarettes you pay tax on that if you buy beer yeah so just because we don't have a state income tax they get us proportionately higher in other areas yeah yeah so i don't know you you don't have a state income tax in Texas no that's so yeah that's not so bad but they still have to get the money somewhere to they get it somewhere and and the problem is with that if you have a state income tax you can take it off you federal yeah so we can't take our any of our sales taxes or anything off anymore because of the reform but that's what they up it they up it on gasoline they up it on um say beer and cigarettes uh user's fee driver's license license plates it all just keeps going up and up and up and they tell us it's not really taxes you know you know but right it is and uh no i don't know i don't know what the answer is to all this i think uh same difference what i don't know i i think it's a i i don't know i i think i think it's like private like you said privatization is good because you know when the profit uh one good thing that could be said for the profit motive is people aren't going to run a business at a loss i happen to work for a city for the City of New York and uh that's the attitude that uh at least my agency takes right you know they they when they take the attitude that uh this is a business right and and if you're not going to run it profitably then you're going to be out of business because they are going to privatize it so in that sense you know at my agency and and it's unique i think for government agencies is revenue producing right and we make more money than we than we cost so uh well that's really unusual so nobody's ever going to question my salary or anybody else on my staff uh especially my unit because my unit is a revenue producing unit uh there are other right you know things that that may i mean look at that i was talking to my father the other day about the NASA program you know he thought it was kind of ridiculous we spend all this money to send these rocket ships up into space and stuff but yet then again they come up with all these scientific discoveries that may help save us sometime i mean i think it was NASA right that we've learned a lot yeah you do learn a lot so you're not you you know you're paying all this money but you're getting something back for it uh yeah you know military spending is the same thing whether you agree or you disagree with building all these bombs and stuff which i happen to have a tendency to disagree with uh you know we are buying protection you know we are protecting ourselves from from uh from other countries that we may be afraid of whether it's right yeah  i'm i'm ready why don't you go ahead and start off okay well i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a a nursing home or anything my both of my parents are dead but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home uh like a nursing home and i had went there very often to visit her and uh made me feel really sad if i did have a mother living i don't think i could do that i think they would be better off being at home with their family you know i agree although we're in that situation right now we have a an eighty seven year old mother-in-law living with me right now uh-huh um-hum and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently and even moving from her house to our house has been tremendously unsettling for her and we have several young children and they about drive her crazy um-hum um-hum oh i can believe that yes because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that in a situation like that maybe it would be better well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because again uh most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me um-hum and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there and i think she'd really resent it oh yeah and i think that would make it very hard but on the other hand i see my wife with i guess our youngest one now is five um-hum oh and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself she needs to be bathed and dressed and a lot of those kinds of things uh-huh oh see now that's that's that's really a sad situation and so the drain on the family yeah really you know i just and when the kids have kids come over you know she's always saying well why do they have to be here why can't they send them home it's too noisy and she'll say that to the kid's friends um-hum yeah right right so it's a hard situation either way i think yeah in a case like that you know you more or less think it it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where and i think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that as opposed to considering her current circumstances and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but the cost of these nursing homes are so oh prohibitive you know a lot of people can't afford that yeah you know so you really have no choice that way if you you know if you're not rich or something you know um i know this lady that you know that was a friend of mine now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there you know and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there yeah so i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care um-hum that's more readily available you know i think if we could send her someplace for the day yeah then bring her back home at night and she could be around some elderly people and have some activities would be of more interest to her and then in the evening have her return and be with the family um-hum um-hum yeah you know just come home for dinner and then usually they want to go to bed pretty early anyhow you know so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that but yeah but there's not many of those available right now and they're very hard to get them into and right um-hum we tried sending her to a senior citizen center but they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile and so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in she can't participate in um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum hm but i think it's an issue that you know with the graying of America we're really going to have to as a as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this um-hum because it is a difficult situation and you know you hate seeing them just sort of send off and not well cared for yeah and yet if if they don't know anybody and they don't know what's going on around them and everything like that well i can see maybe a nursing home would be better you know but if they they have their wits about them and everything why it's kind of hard and then i think it depends on their physical ability too you know if they could be up and doing some things it might be better than when they're just sort of needing almost constant supervision and care um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well uh my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that and uh luckily i mean she lived by herself and then you know one day she had a heart attack and she was gone so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that but there's so many of us kids there was like seven of us that my we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow yeah you know she could've taken turns living with each one of us you know for a short a short a period of time because we all don't live in the same city anyhow or nor the same state do you live at all close to each other so uh uh a couple i have a couple more that live out here in California but then i have a brother  well so you you don't know too much about the Dallas Mavericks this this no what where they at this year uh they win in their division no they are uh only just a slightly a bit better than uh the other expansion teams they're they're they're a team in disarray right now uh-huh uh-huh do you do you have a season pass you go watch them or actually i used to and i gave it up this year because i thought well Roy Tarpley wasn't going to make it and sure enough about a week after i decided not to buy my ticket he went down with his uh his drug problems uh-huh huh and uh boy the team just is going into a tailspin since then yeah that's too bad i'm i guess i'd be most familiar with uh the Jazz yeah uh and i've never watched them but uh interestingly enough i i i got to meet Carl Malone you're kidding huh-uh uh well it i live about forty five miles from Jackpot Nevada how'd you manage that um-hum and uh it's a town it's a town where they uh have uh uh casinos and so forth and i guess that's one of his pastimes i caught him down there and he was playing the slot machines and uh yeah you know would you know it somebody like him he hit a five thousand dollar jackpot and then he turned around hit hit another two thousand dollar jackpot and they came and took his picture and you know got the uh the IRS forms and stuff and he sat there and put all the money back into the machine lost every penny of it didn't bother him a bit sound sounds like a real game huh just yeah just doing it for enjoyment well he must he must be a pretty big guy it was incredible when he stood up he just towered he was a good foot above anybody in there gee and uh everybody everybody was uh kind of excited to see him and he's he oddly enough he was uh very friendly and cordial and stopped to sign a few things and well it's it's it's nice to see those those you know those kind of guys when they get paid all those big bucks to uh you know to be halfway friendly so it was it was neat yeah um-hum but i know what you mean about talking about being big i mean that's when i was in high school i got i went to a Cleveland Cavaliers game i'm from Ohio and a friend of mine runs or used to run the clock down on the floor so he'd let me get down on the floor at half time and i stood by these guys they all walked out and and gee whiz they're just monsters um-hum uh-huh seven foot doesn't sound that tall but boy when you stand next to one it it is real tall yep yeah i hear you so so if you you don't you don't get down to uh basketball games very often then i don't no we've got a small of course this isn't professional basketball but uh the CSI Golden Eagles um-hum i don't know if you've heard of them they're they're number they're the number one junior college in the state in the nation excuse me wow and uh so they're here and they're kind of fun to go watch but uh uh that's that's the the most closest i get to in fact i've only seen one professional basketball game uh so you didn't watch the all star game uh yesterday i kind of watched it on television parts of it i didn't i didn't see the whole thing yeah i i got out the weather was so nice here that i got out and didn't didn't see any of it uh-huh uh yeah well well what do you think about Magic Johnson should he play or should he well that's uh you you talking about the Olympics now yeah i guess the summer Olympics is uh what they yeah the summer Olympics is his next thing well i really you know it's it's his choice to play but there's a lot of other people you know the other team's choice not not to play against him i think he's gonna find a lot of people just say well heck i'm not going to worry you know i'm not gonna mess with that yeah uh-huh yeah well i don't i think they that they'd feel that way too interestingly enough they've kept a seat a seat open uh and he may even play in the in the tournament games for uh LA are you serious i'm serious i heard that the other day on a sports how can how can they do that if he doesn't played the whole season i i don't know i don't know i guess the roster's one man you know there's a hole there still oh unless they yeah unless they're just carrying a one odd guy instead of carrying the ten or eleven that they carry just carry one less yeah right that's what they've done well i you know i didn't watch the game but a a friend of mine was telling me that he you know he played a lot but he he played then he'd sit down then he'd play and he'd sit down and it wasn't like he was out there for twenty or thirty minutes at a at a go and there's yeah no he wasn't and the the the part i saw is he he made the last shot of the game off balance three pointer and i guess so yeah once once uh he starts losing that weight and can't keep it on you know he'll have to slow down and not not do that kind of stuff that that's got to be awful tough awful tough on his body uh-huh yeah uh-huh well when's your Mavericks gonna do something oh gee whiz the the they are they need more people they need a coach what do they need they need players and and they need a front office that that can judge players we've traded away so many good players in the past five years and got nothing for them players and drafted so many bad players and you know they haven't turned out hm it's uh it's very frustrating we had we had one year where we had two first round picks and we picked uh a guy by the name of Bill Wittington uh who's a seven foot center a white guy and Uvay Blob another seven foot white center and they are both okay but i think both of them are playing in the Italy now hm and they you know they they traded away Mark Aguirre and got nothing for him i mean he had to go but they they um-hum  well Liz what sort of things have you had to return lately because of poor quality well i was just thinking about that i really haven't uh i haven't had to take anything back that there was poor quality i took something back that that wasn't quite what i thought it was uh you know some uh some it i had even called my brother this was a uh back when the winter uh you know when the winter was so bad and uh i wanted a vaporizer and uh um-hum i had the right brand and it said a lot of the right things on it but then it wasn't exactly the right one i had to take that back but there was nothing wrong with it yeah have you had much trouble with products well i had an interesting experience with a sweater at Christmas time my mother got me two turtleneck sweaters uh-huh one red one and one black one and i wore the red one and it was fine and i got i was in a hurry one morning to go to work i threw on the black sweater with this suit and i wasn't paying attention i was stuck in a meeting all day with a zipper zipper that was gouging me in the back and the sleeves were too short oh yuck and i was in this meeting all day long oh how awful and uncomfortable yes it was and they were both the same make and everything yes same make same size same style everything oh that is frustrating did they take it back yes as a matter of fact i took it back Saturday to Dillard's my mother bought it at Dillard's in Las Cruces New Mexico uh-huh and i took it to the local Dillard's and said that you know there's something wrong with this sweater these sleeves are definitely two inches shorter i'm very tall and have long arms so sleeve length is critical yeah and and they were willing to take it back yes yeah oh well you know now that you mention that i was thinking of how of more of you know kitchen kind of products or or whatever and and i i uh bought the silk shirts that The Limited had and i just loved them and and i bought one out of town and you know at the time i just said could i return it someplace else you know at another Limited they said yes and the silk comes comes i mean i it's i am finding it amazing that you can just put silk in the washing machine but nonetheless so i mean it's so it's sort of like a little miracle anyway but it pulled yes in you know in the facing in the uh for the where the buttons and the buttonholes are it just the silk just pulled out and i'm a little self conscious about being overweight so you know i kept thinking maybe it's my fault i'm stretching it except the thing just hangs around my body you know oh so i i took it back and they just without question let me get another one and now this other one's doing it too and i think what they're doing is not using enough material right there at that seam so that you know it just pulls apart yeah but i'm not sure that i think i don't know do you think things are worse quality now than they used to be or oh i think some things are clothing definitely uh-huh it seems like you have to pay an awful lot to get decent clothing yeah and but then other things like oh blue jeans you know always seem to be pretty rugged and pretty tough and yeah seem seem to not just sort of be unchanging yeah yeah yes yes but i think anytime you get into high style items things that change all the time that uh think it gets it's tougher for them to maintain the quality um-hum um-hum course if you listen to the the Japanese politicians we're going in the ditch for quality and productivity and everything else yeah well course uh stuff comes from all over too so uh and i was just thinking about that of of the things that i've that i've uh bought recently i'd i'm a little worried about those long items i just had to buy a new washing machine and uh the one i had was twenty one twenty two years old no um no no no no it was more like twenty four years old and just had just gone on beautifully the whole time till the end it finally gave up and i had to i think maybe repaired once in all those years you know so wow so did you buy the same brand the next time well i did so i mean obviously that's what you think about doing it was a it was a Kenmore and um i so i thought about that and then went and found out you well you know these this company and this company's bought and all the companies all the washing machines are made by the same company something like that with different names yeah and i said well no way you what do you mean they're all i mean the why would they make them why would they make different ones in different names it's the same company making them i i found that very upsetting and then it made me think about all the things that have been lasting my refrigerator the dryer the dryer's still going  okay uh Utah has a a good school system where uh as far as i'm concerned i can't really see the difficulty uh or any problems that we have other than they keep saying the ACT scores were a little low or lower than well we're above above the national average but they're talking in the newspapers all the time that we're not doing as well as other countries in science and math which i think there's been an effort to to increase that so i don't see that there's serious any serious uh problems with our school systems here in Utah uh what about Texas oh i'd say uh we probably have what could could be described as serious problems uh-huh from uh gun toting kids to uh low grades on the teens test yeah they uh well i hate i hate to hear it they got a pretty much of a handful of problems to deal with huh where the students are kind of controlling the the schools then in some areas well i don't know if you could say that but they're uh are having to uh put in metal detectors and oh boy security and yeah that's not good uh i'd hate to teach under those situations indeed well well that hasn't got here yet i hope it it doesn't but uh it i know we're we're starting to have a few gangs here associated with the schools yeah that's bad news i tell you they uh yeah but that's where it begins i guess course it always sounds a lot worse than it is i suppose but uh-huh but at least uh i i go into the schools quite a bit in my occupation the different high schools in the in the six western states that i i work in and uh generally from what i can see the uh we don't really have that type of problems in any of the states yet but i know talking to my uh counterparts back east that they're they have uh security guards that patrol the hallways and and that's not a good learning situation if you've got to have policemen there to keep kids in class and yeah so it sound like that's it's kind of getting to that point in Texas in at least where you're at yeah they uh i don't know i think they uh they need to uh get back to the basics i think we yes throwing a lot of money at the problem but it hasn't uh seemed to do what's necessary yet um-hum that's true and i i think that uh in in our Utah school systems we we've kind of reversed going from the social classes back to a lot of the academic classes that uh they feel is necessary and i think that is that's a good change to to get back instead of so many uh off the wall classes that have nothing to do with academic education you know education i think learning social interaction is good too but uh i think it has to be a balanced curriculum uh yes there does uh you can't uh go from one extreme to the other and there there has to be a balance there's got to be both there but i think it should be a little stronger on the academic uh portion in order to prepare them for the society today with the technology that we have they've that's right they've got to have a good math an english background in order to compete yeah i don't think uh American schools in general are uh coming up to where they should be no they're talking about uh in some of the states back here are going two hundred days a year instead of a hundred and eighty i don't know what your school year is there but they're talking about going to year they're actually testing out we just had it on the news tonight about the uh year round school um-hum they go for three months and then take a month off or something we have a a there's a little of that going on here but it's all in the elementary grades it's not in the upper uh um-hum in the secondary area but i it's there's some test cases to see uh if the students are able to if they don't lose as much uh they're able to retain more where they're only out for a month instead of three months and they have to go exactly i think that was the uh thing they mentioned too uh-huh so it sounds like uh in your area and this area too that they're trying to work on the problem that they see as a problem to correct the some some some of the situations uh  so what do you think i figured you were going to ask me first here i was going to ask you first this is a difficult one i mean unfortunately the first thoughts are sort of negative um-hum but then when i give myself a chance to think about it a little bit more i recognize the positives as well uh yes positives for sure are technology and uh-huh um some of the changes that the computer age has brought i think that kids growing up today are just uh very much more facile than i was as a kid in terms of the use of computer technology and you know yeah right that's true i mean i'm twenty six now and i came through high school with about the first generation that had computers in the classroom uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and all that and it certainly has been good for me yes so i see myself you know when i learn a new system a new program or a new computer language that it's much easier for me than for let's say my colleagues who are a lot older but just as intelligent and whatever um-hum and the earlier you learn yes the younger you are probably the easier it is uh-huh um some of that i think probably we take for granted you know the changes have happened so rapidly that it's it's easy for us to forget how quickly it has changed that's true i think probably the other thing i that came to mind is is the increased awareness on our part of the the criminal element if i can put it that way you know you don't you don't uh casually let kids play in the street or you know ride their bike to friends if you're in an area where you're at all concerned about uh-huh and what do you think that's just a question of becoming more aware or has it become less safe over the years abduction i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime yeah i would agree with you and i'm not sure why you know uh certainly a question that we could spend hours on you know whether whether there is a change in um that's right in the way a lot of individuals grow up whether or not there is you know more mental illness or something that causes that sort of thing to go on uh i don't know uh-huh yeah i don't know i think a lot of what causes it is just economics naturally but you know kidnapping is a strange thing you know what kids today are not nearly as free as i was when i was a kid in terms of just being able to go to the store by myself or riding my bike around the neighborhood or uh-huh being being informed at a very young age about uh going to a shopping center and what to do if a stranger approaches you i mean i never had a concept of that as a kid so that's certainly changed a lot in the last ten or twenty years uh-huh yeah i suppose it has uh anyway what are some positives that you could you've thought about besides spending too much time on the criminal element that's right uh it's huh well let's see i think that the mass communication that we have in the world now is in general a good thing and i think it has its good points and bad points but in general it's pretty positive uh-huh it really does bring us together as a global community doesn't it uh more or less yes i mean it is we have the um global village you know like Maclean was saying but it doesn't um-hum i don't think that it really means that we have a sense of community yet as a world uh that's a good point which which hopefully maybe coming we'll have to see uh-huh uh-huh i think that's something that uh is a political influence as well you know probably people feel it on a personal level more than they might um on a on a global level you know just being informed about what other countries and uh-huh other cultures are doing right in a way that we might not have been informed before but yet politically uh their activities aren't aren't influencing how our leaders direct legislation as as much as they could it's still really focused on our interests you know what i mean well yeah that's definitely right i mean and when we're right well with things like the war in Iraq we were uh-huh dealing with other people's affairs for our own interests certainly is what i believe uh-huh uh-huh yeah um McDonald's uh burning up the uh the rain forests in order to have more cattle grazing so that somehow that's something that's not going to work out in the long term in that kind of a cycle it's going to catch up to us at some point uh-huh um-hum yeah what else has changed social changes uh i think that there's probably a greater awareness sensitivity on the part of men and women to to what the other um um is adjusting to in life  okay well are you there yes i'm here okay well i just bought a new car that's why i checked um oh uh what kind you get it's a Toyota Tercel i love it it's really nice yep how do you like it well that's good my um wife just got a new car a Honda Civic so i think i think it's my turn oh really yeah well a CRX not a Civic i don't why i said Civic yeah oh a CRX that's what i was looking at yeah she liked it and it's been pretty good so far she's had it about um six months now yeah and um it's been a really good car yeah but i don't know i think she when she got one i should get one so i'm looking although slowly right now yeah yeah my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry pardon me my parents are thinking about getting a Toyota Camry because they're supposed to be i think i think Toyotas are really good cars yeah yeah just about everybody i've never had one but everybody i know who has they don't have too many complaints which is can't be said about a lot of cars hm yeah but i don't know i think i want a a Chevy Blazer or a GMC Jimmy truck is what i'm looking for a wagon type of deal yeah those are nice it'd be good i look was i looked at a Toyota 4-Runner actually it's the same type of deal but smaller kind of like the S-10s yeah for the Chevys and i don't know i like i like the bigger ones better than the small ones if you're gonna buy a truck you might as well buy the real one instead of a toy truck yeah well my brother has a my brother just bought a Mazda a little Mazda truck and he loves it course and he's into the little trucks and all and the stereos yeah yeah so uh that sounds pretty good i used to have a an S-10 a little truck i don't know was it was more like having a car than a truck so i decided this time i'll get a big one um-hum yeah my dad used to have a big full size GMC and um he just bought a little S-10 and now he hates it he wants a full size again yeah yeah he wants a big one again yeah he's so used to driving a big truck that has a lot of advantages and i'm up here in New Hampshire so up north with the snow and everything it's a a big advantage to us yeah you from Texas by the way yeah yeah most of the people i talk to on this are from down there i'm one of the few New East Coast people yeah i'm in Dallas yeah well that sounds pretty good do you shop around pretty much when you were looking for your car or yep i didn't do not much at all i went and looked at a GMC i i went and looked at a little truck because i just i don't need you know much more and um right yeah i went and looked at it and it was just i couldn't afford it or anything so and i was just looking for a little stripped down yeah and they just wanted way too much for it so i was kind of looked around and i was going to look at a mainly the trucks but i also looked at a Nissan Sentra yeah and then i went and i looked at the um Toyota Tercel and i ended up getting it because i really liked it i test drove it and i just love it oh that's great yep are those um four cylinders do you know or six cylinder four cylinder mine's a four cylinder yeah you get pretty good gas mileage like yeah really good around thirty or more than that even or it's about thirty i think it's thirty two in the city and uh like thirty out on the highway it's really good yeah yeah that's a that's about what my wife's car gets little bit over thirty which is pretty good i can't complain right now i have a Ford Escort which is the terrible car but it gets good gas mileage so i can't complain too much but it's ugly and you know it's not real comfortable or anything but yeah yeah i bought it used after i graduated from school and it's getting the job done but it's nothing that i really enjoy yeah i used to have a Buick Skylark an eighty one uh my brother used to have one of those really mine was not a good car i bought it used and it yeah and then i had a lot of problems with it it just made me so mad that because i had to pretty much go out and get a new car yeah lot of time in the shop yeah most of the time or sitting out front yeah yeah yeah i know about that i had a i had a Ford Thunderbird for a while and fixed or repaired daily is the joke about the Ford and it was pretty accurate with that car i swore up and down i never own another Ford as long lived and i ended up anyway yeah yep yeah yeah my family's pretty much against Fords too oh i don't think i'll ever have another one after this one but so far it hasn't too mean to me yeah well that's good um do you test drive a lot of cars before you um bought them not really i only i test drove mine the one that i got now and um that's the the only one i went and when i looked at the CRX's uh i just looked at them and they had the lot that i went to the close yeah yeah  i'm ready do you exercise uh during the day time or go to a gym or anything all right oh yeah i i used to go to a gym um last summer but then i started school again so it's um so i don't exercise as much as i'd like um-hum but i i do enjoy um going to a gym and working out or just like i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up and i ride a exercise bike a lot so uh-hum well i try to do it at night before i go to bed um it's really weird because i'll get down on the floor and i'll holler and tell my cat Nikki i'll say Nikki i'm going to do my exercises now um-hum and she can be upstairs in the bedroom and i don't know she knows what i'm talking about you know pretty soon here she comes uh-huh so i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercisings you know uh i had a problem with my back so um-hum when i went to physical therapy they gave me some exercises for my back um-hum oh so i just try to keep that up because it seems like if i don't then then my back gives me a problem again right so i try to do it every night and uh yeah it seems like it's oh that's good you know i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it you know so you know it's got to be good for you um-hum right but um a long time ago i belonged to a gym but uh now i notice that this in this small city that i live in they do have a a gym that just opened up here about a month ago uh-huh hm so i was kind of thinking about joining it but i haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet yeah but um it does really make you feel good and i like to bicycle too oh yeah so that gives you you know lots of exercise yeah it does yeah i enjoy that a lot i um bike in the summer i belong to a biking club here in Kenosha so um-hum and um we go on a like fifty to a hundred miles every Sunday so i try to uh keep up in the winter with the exercise bike so i'm you know can be in shape and that could oh my goodness yeah otherwise you wouldn't be able to go very far huh no huh-uh no i go with my dad he exercises a lot more than i do though oh yeah he's always exercising oh really uh-huh um-hum but i'm not that energetic i can get lazy sometimes yeah yeah well like i say i just do it at night you know and um yeah do you like you try try to get my stomach muscles toned up oh yeah that's what i like to do you know because boy they seem like they really get out of shape and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape um-hum yeah you know so i just been doing it i try to do it every night you know like i say it just i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow yeah oh wow you know so it just kind of nice and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me oh yeah that is neat you know so well i guess that's about all and i can tell you about my exercising i wish i knew how to swim but i don't so i don't go swimming yeah um i don't swim much neither um-hum but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body yeah um-hum so i wished i i wished i did know how to do that if they had a pool here in Patterson i'd probably you know put my bathing suit on and go down there but they don't have a pool in this small city either oh so well listen then it's been nice talking to you yeah it's nice talking to you okay then bye-bye okay um bye  you stand on gun control um i don't know i don't use guns i mean and i don't you know i i don't have any occasion to i've never been much of a hunter and any of that so i guess i haven't really felt real strongly one way or the other uh-huh how about you i i did a fair bit of hunting when i was growing up i pretty well haven't in the last uh fifteen or twenty years pretty well given it up so uh-huh um-hum um now i do have some guns uh uh i enjoy shooting you know for as far as targets and all but i don't particularly enjoy hunting any more i'm not really opposed to it uh uh-huh right but i am i am in favor of uh some some form of of gun control yeah well i guess i do too i um i think that law that they tried to pass i'm not even sure if they passed it or not the seven uh seven day waiting period yeah i i think that's a a reasonable law and i'm not real sure why the NRA was against it um you know it it really didn't the only thing it restricted was that you couldn't pick up the gun right away yeah um i i don't see why you'd oppose it either you know the uh the um for people who want them for legitimate purposes i mean seven days or even even i'd even be in favor of a a yeah thirty days i mean you don't need a gun on short notice yeah seven days shouldn't be a a big a big deal yeah right and if you do you want the gun for something else other than than shooting target because you can always get a gun to go and shoot you know target with yeah for right that's right or you know even hunt you can borrow a gun to do that but uh you know if you want it right away you you want it for a different reason than than the legitimate reason for having a gun that's right and yeah and and uh yeah and uh and the automatic some of the automatic weapons that are sold yeah certainly have no purpose other than to uh kill humans you know when you're talking about some of these automatic weapons yeah it yeah and i i wonder about that because the the the sale of automatic weapons because uh i mean how many how many rounds does it take to kill a deer if that's right yeah you get these twenty and thirty shot rounds if you need thirty shots to kill a deer you should be uh you you should be shooting with a camera because you're dangerous anyway that's right right yeah that's even worse than the that's worse than the auto wind uh cameras that's right so i yeah i guess we uh we kind of feel the same way about about that i uh it's it's funny because i was over at in McKinney the other day and picking up a dog yeah and um and i saw some women um practicing you know shooting uh-huh was just was it just outside some place or and just outside yeah out out in the uh range but um i it reminded me of uh you know i was listening to a talk show the other day and and heard that the majority of the accidents that happen or the shooting that happens happens right in the home with somebody that you know yeah that that's true yeah uh and and it's pretty pretty common that it happens with uh misuse of a gun kids too you know the parent think that the guns hidden or that their uh kids won't bother it but then when they're left alone sometimes uh yeah gun a kid will show it off to a friend and they'll start handling it and pretty soon somebody gets shot yeah a lot of that happened and yeah i i don't i don't really see why the NRA would oppose i guess it's because they you know they don't want any any kind of uh of government restrictions on i i think what they're afraid of is that uh not necessarily of this one particular law or about a waiting period but i think they're afraid that once you know uh you establish one regulation they're afraid others would get started then it's a lot easier to just keep going from there yeah let me but let me switch from my other phone here i i think my hand phone is going dead here is that your phone or mine okay can you still hear me okay yeah i was just shutting the other one down yeah you you must've had a cordless hello hello hello hello oh know know i don't know who's on that one oh hello you there yeah i i'm getting a lot of static i'm not sure what's going on here i switched phones it may be mine um you still there huh well i've i've switched phones so okay um i think they on on they were asking about a numbering system i guess  okay well in the organized i'm with Department of Defense and uh we have random drug testing um-hum and uh the last couple of years and people have really you just accepted that of course the soldiers and then uh the civilians they haven't done the civilians yet but personally i don't think see anything wrong with it uh i think it's a protection to employers and to employees and everybody else if um-hum yeah the in my mind the people that say that it's in violation of their privacy it's it's actually a violation of the people they work with if uh uh-huh it's not fair to have people working around you that uh could cause accidents or harm to yourself you bet i really like it the way they do it in the in the military they go by social security numbers and they take the last number and uh so it uh and it it or or just pick a last number social security numbers uh and that's the way they do it and it works really well um-hum and um i work with recruiters a lot and they have uh they have it monthly with recruiters is that mandatory for the recruiters uh no no uh they do it that way but uh well it's every three months excuse me every three months and they have uh we have about um oh a hundred and fifteen recruiters in our area um-hum and uh they have a fourth of them every three months they on a random basis um-hum has but uh has your number come up no no hasn't come up i don't know i um-hum that's fine if it does i the only thing you have to be careful if i know all those who join the service sure uh it is mandatory that they're tested for drugs um-hum and uh if drugs are found uh in the system then uh they're barred for enlistment for six months and then they can come back once and test again and if it's uh still positive then they can't join hm they've really cracked down on that and uh i think that's that's good because the source of the bad crime of reputation for for drugs um-hum but it's surprising uh since they've been on well the first couple of months this has been around for about a year and a half the first few months there was quite a few that were disqualified and uh since then you just never hear of it i guess the word got out and the kids know that if they want to commit and and join then uh they have to be straight hm the only thing that's kind of scary if you eat one of these buns with cinnamon with these uh poppy seeds on it yes and that would show up you're kidding no no it's it's uh huh it's kind of strange uh but uh yeah they they tell them that if they uh if they're going to if they come into the motel to stay overnight prior to being physical and tested and then so forth they tell them not to eat anything with poppy seeds on it a hard roll if they're having lunch or something or dinner but hm um-hum well what does it test uh for well i'm not sure and it just shows that they're uh uh but they they specify that or just tell them that they'll have to kind of be careful well and it's the same with alcoholic beverages they they test for that too um-hum and uh i think it's great i really do i mean yeah but in the work place i i feel that it it should be uh something that the employers have the right to do if they want um-hum to protect everyone concerned and yeah the the only problem i can see and i've heard is the the fact that if they uh hm if the test whoever runs the test they've got to make sure they run it correctly so it's not a a misreading on it or something um-hum and that that's happened in some instances i guess but uh hm i think they're pretty well i've heard what i've heard and especially the ones that that test the the soldiers they uh they make sure they they run them correctly and uh have the right right person with right sample and everything but um-hum my my company's small enough here that uh so in fact i don't know of any companies right around the Twin Falls area that's testing i'm sure they're here uh-huh but i certainly wouldn't be opposed um is is it hard for you to tell people that are on drugs i mean and i don't know how you can confirm that or not but uh uh i'd really be surprised if someone in my company was using drugs now it doesn't mean they're that they're not there uh-huh and maybe the testing wouldn't you know show that they were there yeah i especially the the uh alcoholic alcohol part of it uh that's a that's a thing that uh but you can see that pretty easy can't you yeah right you really can you can and uh  okay well what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody i think they should i know i had a job until let's see a year ago this past December i was working for PIE and they closed and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance but um for me to try to get it now uh it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at at pie good grief that's just almost unaffordable isn't it right it really is and i think you know i think the God the government should come up with some kind of a health plan or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high well i wonder if they couldn't just provide uh interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that that might be a step in the right direction i don't know well the thing is you know jobs are so hard to find you know and then what you can get out here in anyhow in the valley where i live at now they don't wanna pay anything for health insurance at all uh-huh no benefits you know um yes i mean you get a job now and you mean the uh the employers uh-huh the wages are really low and uh because everybody's competing for jobs yeah and they don't want uh to pay any benefits so you just you know pray to God that you don't get sick well i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do i I have to think about it some more now because my doctor is uh actually he's Canadian um-hum and uh he told me that there're a lot of uh lot of counts against the Canadian system which is basically the one people are talking about for here i don't understand the arguments exactly he says it restricts your choice um-hum of doctors and and so forth i'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does no i don't understand that either i mean we're on a private insurance plan right now uh actually uh i have my own business and and we uh our health insurance is through my wife's employer um-hum um-hum and uh and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to and where we can buy or medicine and and uh it changes every year it's always so confusing so uh yeah well i know the plan that i had with PIE i could go to any doctor and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled you know then i just sent cards in and then um-hum they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine and then they would just send me a check for what was ever over that you know well yeah of course the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept the uh the limits of uh compensation but of course that is restricted choice so um-hum um-hum um-hum i don't think that the restricted choice really uh has to do with the difference between uh public and private health insurance i think it has to do with the the the uh attempt to limit cost doesn't it and uh everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way so uh yeah that's true that's true there well um i guess the most sensible thing i've heard about this is they they say people are trying you you you have to recognize that if you're going to well have the very best health care possible and uh available on demand whenever and wherever you want it then it's gonna be expensive yeah right and if you wanna pay less then you're gonna have to settle for a health system that is not quite that uh lavish um-hum and uh but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything you know that people that's on unemployment yeah well what happened to Reagan's safety net anyway did he take that back to California with him i don't know using it for a trampoline now yeah probably so i don't know but it is it does seem to be a big problem you know i don't know what they're gonna come up with but um i sure wish they would come up with with something and uh like i say and and i'm at the age too where the i'll be fifty seven in June and the people don't wanna hire people this age any more and i worked for my previous company for twenty six years you know so it's kind of hard you know so yeah they'll be needing you in a couple of years because they're running out of kids down there at the other end and uh yeah they'll be calling at my door huh but any how well if they're smart yeah now i I do think the government though is gonna have to do something uh with this problem because it you you know even to go to a little doctor out here just to ask him anything costs you forty bucks uh-huh you know just for the visit and then he then that's not counting what medicine you're gonna buy and everything else you know and he might tell you well you know now you're gonna have to come back in a week and then that's another forty bucks plus whatever else he decides to do to you right  okay how do you feel about it well i feel like the major problem we have and the reason that crime has gotten so out of hand is because there isn't a punishment that's matching what's being done i agree with that and i think it starts when the kids are little i think the parents in our community teach our children that as long as they can get away with something that it's all right um-hum because i don't see a lot of parents especially where i'm at i have a lot of the responsibility of what ever is done in our neighborhood because there's no other mothers at home yes i have the same thing here and i see a lot of kids very small kids coming home to empty homes every day and doing all kinds of unbelievable things and as long as they don't let anybody know about it they get away with it so you know i feel like if our parents mothers stayed home if we had that secure start you know where kids learned the right way to act um they were rewarded for their good behavior and they had a secure family that they came from i think we'd see a whole different society yeah that kind of goes right along with what i'm thinking too is well the movies and the TV the violence and all the things that are on there if the parents were home in the afternoon when the children came home maybe they wouldn't be watching as much as this that's right but then again there's some of them at home at night with them that do not monitor what their children are watching and so it's i think you're right in that it is parents caring enough to may be put off having that other car or the other TV or what ever it is they're working for yeah right and take care of the children well you know i did a survey on why mothers left their children to go to work and i found out that more than eighty percent of all the people i talked to um-hum what'd you find out the mothers went to work to provide a better life for their children and when i talked with their children their children wanted their parents home rather than the the the material things they were getting yes i i can believe that and it's just too bad that the parents won't listen to this survey so i just think that um another problem is i think the way the legal system has been set up that the criminals get out and the jails are so over crowded they can't handle punishing the um-hum people that are committing the bad crimes sufficiently i think they need to put more people out to death um if it's completely witnessed and it's uh seen that there's no you know i think there needs to be more severe punishment but it needs to be fair um-hum right right but and maybe not quite so much publicity either i think there's far too much publicity on some of these violent crimes that and then it seems to become a challenge right i think that to oh out do it to be shown to people to see if they can get away with it yeah or out do what's been done right that it's yeah i think that's another problem um i know that once when i was reading a book when i was studying history and it said you show me a country that can produce strong families and you'll have a strong country and if you look back over United States histories our country was strong until the mothers started leaving the home um-hum women's rights and all these good things the children are the ones who suffer that's right that's right and they do and then they grow up and it just continually will get worse yes and and so i guess what we both agree on is that families need to change their way of thinking right right yes and until the families change i think that we'll continue to have this problem and it will worsen right and i think people need to have some sort of a an idea of why we're here and what we're doing and what we're working towards and why it's important to do these things rather than just getting ahead materialistically yes uh-huh uh back to the old basic morals and that's right well um do they come do they come on and say when we've talked visited for five minutes and things that i i don't know i i thought they did but this is my first time also so well but in this is your first time um we discussed i discussed on here with someone um last week about the justice system and how it could be improved on juries and we discussed about how half the jury that they select to um-hum you know come up with the verdict if half of those were law students then they could understand what was going on in the court room and have the time that they spent in their jury district count towards some of their graduation hours hey that would be a good idea that's wouldn't that be a good idea because i think so sometimes the juries don't understand all this the legal you know talk and and what's going on yeah and this way it would get people that were a little more knowledgeable at least half of them to be on that board or on the jury that  do regular exercise since i was just feeling extremely guilty about this it's a timely question um i do not exercise enough i have um i'm overweight and uh under under exercised and um can i can tell it affects me and i don't know why i can't make myself do it have you have you tried uh you know beginning something and it hasn't worked so you've stopped after a while or just try to get well i used to i used to do more things uh currently i've just gotten a they're a really nice tape Angela Lansbury has done and it's very mild it's mostly stretching but i've i've more mornings than not i will do at least ten minutes with her which is a good starter then then there's a twenty minute part afterwards that i tell myself every day when i get back i have a erratic schedule you know and when i come back in i'll do the twenty minutes uh-huh but anyway uh well that's good i mean at least you've given some time to it every day it's not as if you're not doing anything it's some some a little something yes but uh i really enjoy walking and somehow i'll do it for a while maybe a month or two months and you know walk two miles a day or something and then and then quit i uh-huh it's hard hard to schedule in what about you it is you know i think the problem for me has always been trying to find a time of day that's going to work um yes i think probably the best way to get it done is to do it in the morning but i'm not a morning person um-hum um and if i try to wait till the end of the day when i think i have a little bit more time i don't always have the energy level yeah that's hard isn't it uh that that four to six o'clock i see a lot of people out walking and i just think oh i'm just going to go and you know just sit yeah you get home and you start fixing dinner or whatever um yeah um i've tried to do a combination of stretching and and strengthening because my problem has been keeping strong i think enough i i tend if i don't i tend to have over stretched muscles in fact it's called a hypomobility oh but if i don't keep strong enough i can pull a muscle more easily say if i go on vacation oh i see uh and pick up some heavy suitcases it might stretch a muscle that would not have felt injured if i had kept the muscle strong enough to really support the joints so um yeah yeah and so do you do it that's well you know tomorrow night there's a sale at one of the shopping centers close by on barbells well uh-huh and you're thinking about getting them i'm definitely going to because i work at a hospital where there is a physical therapy department and i've used their barbells for a long while but i know i need to get more regular and do it at home so if i oh yeah yeah purchase my own i think i'm more inclined to do so and they're a good price yeah that it is and it is hard to do i mean it is easier to do at home even the walking which i can do right here the idea of getting of getting in a car to drive to a a place which a number of my friends keep suggesting just exhausts me because i drive so much in my job and i just am not going to get back in the car to drive somewhere you know and there are all these people there and you have to put on these clothes and and i uh so i'd much rather do it here now my daughter has a see i can't do that yeah and that's that's exactly the same with me a bike uh but it's a real bike and she cycles and she can put it on a thing but you have to be the right size to fit that oh so you've thought about that as well a bike exercise i've thought i've thought about doing that uh this tape is nice walking as i say is one that i really like i'm concerned about flexibility i'm i'm almost fifty and and i can you know begin to feel a little of that um-hum uh-huh uh-huh going and and i want to be able to turn around and see if the you know uh when i'm driving uh not just look in the rear view mirror but easily turn around and go up steps and all that without huffing and puffing well right feel it in your neck in other words yes yeah yeah my legs uh-huh it's interesting some people choose to go to classes because they feel that that will maintain their motivation they've either invested the money in it or there're people there that expect them or yes whatever but i think it's just the opposite with me i i need to have the flexibility to do it on my own time and yet i'm not sure well there is there is that that is a plus and i did do that i used to do it and and it and it is a plus and i almost took Tai Che that's something that's interested me for a long time and i it is beautiful um-hum oh uh it is beautiful and it seems like it it combines a lot of things so so you know sort of a a mental attitude as well as the physical but um um-hum um-hum the the the guy insisted that you would have to come everytime he and i thought well this is really good because he's you know dedicated and you have to do these things but the first three Saturdays uh i was doing trainings i mean you know it's it was on Saturday mornings and already they you know i i already couldn't do it so i was like oh okay well that's oh jobs uh-huh needs to be more flexible for your schedule yeah that's the problem and he just says has to be you know i've got a class opening at nine thirty on Saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but you that's when you're supposed to come um-hum um-hum and actually i hadn't been doing any Saturday trainings and then all of a sudden right when the class opened i'm you know so  well do you have any children that uh go to college went to college are about to go or anything yeah i had five go through college we've put five through college uh-huh oh my goodness oh where did they go uh two at Texas A and M and three at North Texas uh-huh uh-huh oh my goodness well you are a very experienced person right so uh i have a son at the present moment who is a senior in high school and uh he has uh made three applications to schools that give a double degree program because that's what he wanted to uh take so he applied to the University of Texas at Austin and to the University of Pennsylvania and to Rice um-hum so uh he's waiting at this time uh to uh see what kind of uh acceptances and money grants might uh come in for him so um i i think that uh it became very evident in the beginning of senior year when he actually had to sit down with the applications he had about six schools that he was interested in but he really decided that he wants to take engineering but he also wants to keep a liberal arts degree and actually get both of them and not all that many places actually give you two degrees right right right so he he weeded out the ones uh that did not offer that kind of thing and just really wound up making three applications so um um-hum that's probably your best bet because you know you narrow it down you're better off i think on that and uh yeah yeah uh-huh right well yeah and and as i saw the fall progressing and um and his viewpoint it really became more evident that uh he this is what he wanted to do and he didn't just want to get involved in the sciences without having the leeway of the liberal arts and i don't think he'll ever be a um you know a kind of a research dedicated a test tube scientist so um right right is he going on for his master's in his the engineering i think he might wanna go to law school um-hum and uh use the engineering background maybe in patent law or yeah you almost need a master's in like if he's in engineering in his major right now one of his majors anyway right now to do anything with it yeah yeah oh yes that's right yeah what uh kinds of fields did your children study in no matter what field you're in uh well my daughter uh both daughters let me see one daughter was in uh business uh-huh and business degree and then the other daughter was in a special ed degree oh wonderful uh-huh and lives and worths works with autistic children um-hum and then the other one was a personnel director is that right uh-huh oh my uh down in Houston for um several years seven years and then uh my son is a CPA yeah uh-huh and another has a business degree and then the fifth one is he was hotel management but actually he's in the sign business now and making signs oh my oh gee whiz isn't that wonderful uh-huh and uh likes that and has kind of hit on a nice setup with that so is he uh local here in town or is uh-huh he is local right here in Richardson and he really loves it um-hum and it's just you know oh good for him that signs the type of signs they do is new in the last five years it's the latest thing in signs it's the type that you put on the uh-huh oh put on windows and it peels off type and it looks like it's painted on oh yes i've seen those they're remarkable because they come right off yes and he yeah right he has the Dallas um Furniture Mart um Clothing Mart and the Trade World Trade Center all tied up in that he has oh oh good for him so yeah so it's a nice deal for him yeah he has he's just starting in it but it seems to be a real up and coming thing oh they've done well uh-huh oh yeah oh yes that is terrific because everything's so portable anymore i mean you know things are not stable and people are renting places for a short times and they don't want anything permanent anymore so that's right that's right uh-huh that's right you just use it when you need it and uh then it's you know gone and it it sure is very effective and then you can move into the next necessary thing that is uh right it works out quite well right right um-hum or on to a larger place and not put that much into anything permanent so it it works out pretty well for him that's right it's amazing isn't it amazing everything they do these days it is it's wonderful it's wonderful uh uh-huh it i i think it is too it really moves you from one thing to the other without having to hassle and uh you know even like with you said with the signs have to you know to change so right um-hum everything and uh you know yeah the have your son have your son use the library a lot in the college section um-hum um-hum for scholarships uh-huh and uh my daughters and sons both did that and they they came up with some of the you know you would never think of applying for and they would apply for them well nobody else did and so they would get some yeah oh really  okay Jean what what have you recently painted well i'm not uh painting of the artist variety what i like to do is i like to paint the inside of a house um-hum paint cabinets or paint furniture but i'm not doing much of that right now haven't for quite some time um-hum uh-huh how about you well i painted a shed this summer that i built and i went and borrowed a uh a paint sprayer from a a fellow that i know i'm good friends with and it's the only way to go i painted eight gallons of paint um i i put some stain and stuff on a on a redwood deck i made and i painted the uh my shed and it probably took me about six hours but it was just it's just incredible how much easier it is uh with a spray gun how much smoother it goes on and even and more professional looking and um i don't know i was just really pleased with it do you use some kind of a power painter rollers or something when you paint or just just uh old fashioned brush and roller yes yeah when is that right you you you do it the hard way i shouldn't yes uh a a very messy way too uh we haven't done much painting these sound so hard but interior or exterior in the last uh two years two and a half years we we bought a mobile home and with the natural oak um-hum or natural wood paneling on the inside we don't have that painting to to contend with but uh my husband has painted uh some of our storage buildings and when he put the uh skirting around the the mobile home then it had to be uh sealed painted um-hum um how do you uh oh i would imagine that the weather's pretty hard on paints down there is it is it not yes it is uh probably the summers the summers are harder winters actually than the winters are because it uh the sun you know bakes and dries them out and we don't have an a lot of freezing weather like you would in Idaho uh-huh uh-huh how frequently do you have to paint then uh usually not more often than about every oh three to five years depending on the type of finish that you use and too the the type of wood that you're putting it on how how do you uh prep your wood is there a fast easy way or is it just the old scraper brush on the outside is i guess what i'm speaking of oh that is the um the only thing that that i know of we um were fortunate in that the last uh painting work that my husband did was on new finish so it didn't have to be um-hum prepped anyway we had painted uh or had paint i had a house painted that we owned over in uh Greenville and we had it brushed and scraped and uh a primer coat brushed on and then the in fact i think there was two coats of primer and then three coats of the uh paint that went on that it was an old frame frame house but it lasted very very well it must have been on there nearly ten years before it needed painting again hm inside how do you keep the paint off your carpet or do you have that problem anytime i try something like that i got paint all over the carpet and we're in there with uh i have to use water base paint and and uh in there with a big wet towel and about every three minutes i got to stop and clean my paint specks up all over yeah that sounds familiar too my husband hates to see me get the painting bug because he says i'm i make a a terrible mess and i guess i do but um huh uh in the times that he has helped me taping the uh one of those plastic drop cloths to the baseboard yes and then setting chairs or something against it to keep the keep it from getting kicked loose is about the best way to keep it you know from speckling all around um-hum uh how did you get involved in the uh this project that we're doing on the voice recording uh Brian White from down there as i mentioned before sent his his wife and my uh and my wife of course are sisters are sisters and they got involved in it they got us involved in it uh-huh but kind of enjoyed it um don't always have time to to pick the phone up and participate  okay well how many children do you have well i have three they are all grown but i have three grandchildren that live very close by that i spend a lot of time with yeah well that's great that's good how old are your grandchildren oh see oldest one's fourteen then the youngest one is six well good my we have five children and our oldest one uh will turn uh fifteen next month and the youngest one uh will turn uh eight the end of April so they're about the same uh range as your grandchildren um-hum uh and so uh they're pretty busy right now we the oldest is in uh right uh the ninth grade school here uh the second one is in uh junior high third one is in uh what they call it intermediate school fifth and sixth grades um-hum right and the last two are in uh an elementary school and it looks like uh we're gonna have them in at least four different schools for uh you know three more years so that keeps us busy running around some times uh-huh oh yes are your are are yours in school near there your yes yes they are in fact you know i pick them up from school their mother is also going to school she's in nurses' school and ought to be finished in May so that leaves me a lot of time with the grandchildren hum what kind of things have you done with the kids oh well like they are in dance class and things like that and i pick them up from school and i take them there um which it's all right for one of them i think because she enjoys it and seems to have a talent for it but the other one i wonder about i think she's just pushed into it yeah well that's possible for now to have something to do and uh are yeah i guess that trade off between uh you know letting them just do the things they enjoy doing or pushing them kind of just a little bit of a nudge so that they they uh you know get into something far enough that they do enjoy it by themselves you know is is a tension for most parents yes uh-huh well i i can can sympathize i know i i would go when mine were growing up uh from one extreme to the other you know either i we didn't do anything or we did too much it's it's hard to decide and uh yeah right right decide when they're old enough to make their own decisions that uh you are i wanted them to have the opportunities to do what they wanted but that's right we um-hum wasn't sure what that was yeah well we found out particularly with piano we wanted the kids to take piano for a few years you know and i said well you need to take it for for at least six so that you know whether you wanna do it any more you build up enough enough skill that you can you make a a reasonable choice so we pushed for a few years but then uh then we moved and and dropped it i hope some get back into something into something well they may pick it up a little bit later and uh i hope so all that but uh i know my oldest one he is well he's an honor student and just wins all the awards at school but he's not really outside of school involved in anything other than the church activities so uh he's not a baseballer or anything like that but he seems very well adjusted and well um-hum most of our focus is either on some school activities or going to or our church activities and they uh we just moved here uh this summer and so we uh we're sort of getting into things uh they've got a good number of of activities and uh we enjoy you know transporting them to that because we really hope there's gonna be some benefit from those things you know and uh oh right yes that's that is good so they're they're doing that we uh uh haven't gotten into too many civic activities where we were before they were playing soccer and uh um-hum did a little bit of gymnastics uh things like that uh here we haven't really gotten into it too much uh we may later on sometime if you know they show particular interest yeah i imagine imagine it takes a while to settle down and let children settle in school and sure find out friends and what what it is they're wanting to do that's right yeah so well i uh i don't know about the time we spend with them it seems like we're with them all the time if we're not here you know not working you know uh but um i'm sure they'd like more and it's hard for us it's hard to balance it you know there's some that sort of uh i don't know about demand but you know sort of just take up more time just by their nature and uh we we struggle to uh i do any way not to work so much that i i don't give them time you know being with them and stuff like that oh yes uh-huh uh sometimes it'd be just nice to come to the office and and work straight through without you know uh spending time with them but i like you know i like to spend time with them and and be with the kids and all like that i well yeah well it's uh do you take them over say to see  well uh what is your favorite kind of music well i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be uh classical music oh same here yeah oh really what type of music do you like in the classical area or what era do you era do you like the most oh well i guess i like a wide range uh everything from uh from Baroque through at least some modern music um-hum and my wife and i these days are especially into opera we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now um do you go to the operas that they sing English or go to the ones that they sing other languages well we uh generally the places we've gone they sing in the original languages um-hum like the Dallas Opera here normally does i guess um-hum yeah i i haven't gotten into that too much because i uh if i don't know the story line and um i don't speak the language then i have difficult time comprehending what's going on well one thing that's helped us a lot is that uh you you know you can buy a lot of these operas now on video cassettes uh video tape um-hum and so we have quite a collection of those and you watch them at home and they have subtitles so you you figure out what's going on after a while and then you can enjoy it in the uh theater but you know the uh Dallas opera now has uh super titles on on all their performances i think what is that well they they give an uh an English translation on a on a screen up above the stage oh i didn't know that yeah that can help people like me in fact they even do that for operas sung sung in English because it is hard to understand the words some times well i can understand that so i'd say Vivaldi is probably my favorite uh composer yeah well i really like Vivaldi uh he's uh definitely uh one of the one of the top of that era yeah i like Baroque music i like full body music uh with the uh uh with brass and winds wood winds instruments uh course i like uh also string instruments and i have two string instruments in my house uh instrument players um-hum both my sons play string instruments one plays a Cello and the other one plays the Viola oh so i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year uh-huh how how old are they uh one is thirteen and one is eleven so they're doing this in school or what uh-huh yes yes sure well you've got half a string quartet there yeah we're on our way yeah so uh um i try to enjoy all of it well since you seem to like uh Italian music have you ever uh gotten into Gabrielli or anybody there in that era the uh uh period right before actually before Vivaldi i guess um a little bit but um a lot of the um music i don't know about uh as far as the titles and i have to listen to it and and figure out what i'm listening to uh-huh um i do belong to a Musical Heritage Society oh yes uh-huh do you belong to that no i don't but i think i know what it is isn't that a uh uh see can't you get records through that or something recordings you can get recordings uh they now have them on compact disc or uh or cassettes or LP's um-hum and uh they do their they do a lot of original recordings themselves yes yeah i think uh uh but they also uh they also uh go to the different composers or the different i guess uh what do you call them the guys that orchestrate uh the conductors the conductors yeah they go to conductors uh and and they actually have them perform the music and they record it uh yes right so they're actually commissioned performances sure a lot of them are uh-huh or they will know find out when they're performing and they will uh record the music at that time and so uh it is uh uh high quality grade music and of course now they're getting in they also have a jazz section and they also have a uh more contemporary and American uh composer section uh-huh well i have good heard good things about the uh Music Heritage Society but if i get involved in one of those things i end up spending all my money on the on the music or yeah well you can control it uh almost uh almost uh bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the Columbia Record Club many years ago oh really yeah my room mate signed me up he got a bonus record and i got a lot of bills i see so we have to watch that huh well that's good uh do you play an instrument yourself yes i i play guitar and and early years played saxophone  i'm ready okay have you returned anything lately uh no i haven't the only thing i had to i had to return was a table top but that was like three years ago of a dining room table that i got hm it was marked on the top of it so all they did was replace it uh but as far as um lawn mowers i've bought lawn mowers in the last three and a half years um-hum and they've been working fine my hedger's working fine my weedeater's working fine i haven't really had to return anything you know except that table top that was marked um-hum hm now okay wait wait a there was a topic talking about returning lawn equipment or was it anything no i said anything oh okay now okay um well i uh i returned a camera recently i i bought a little uh Minolta camera oh you did uh-huh and uh the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldn't huh so uh after my second roll of film i i took two rolls before i got decided uh because i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed um-hum and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasn't it so i uh i took it back and returned it but most i don't know i haven't had to return a lot of stuff um-hum well did did they give you any back any problem or they just give you a new one or what well i took it back and i figured it was i don't know something like an auto focus i don't know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something um so i because my dad has a has an auto focus camera and it works great and he's never had any problems in fact he's he's had a couple of them and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff yeah right so they're not uh i think they're more uh i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated uh-huh so i guess not call it quality control but you know since they're so generic they wouldn't uh there's you know um-hum i i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good pictures so i just said well hell with it i'll just go out and get a nice camera yeah right um-hum but uh so i took it back and uh i bought a i bought a more expensive camera but you know i think when uh when i was in college i was always buying like just cheap stuff stuff that would make do and that's the kind of stuff i took back because you bring it home and you're like oh well this sucks you know um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah if you go and buy something really good usually it is it's good you know oh um-hum um-hum and you don't ever anyhow i've haven't ever had any problems in returning anything yeah that i've bought that i feel that you know was worth the money that you pay for it um-hum yeah and i think uh the way i was raised my parents always uh used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it um-hum so i don't know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i haven't had to return a lot if i had had to return it it's more because i realize i didn't need it or you know not because it's defective um-hum but uh more because uh you know i have the option to take it back and i really didn't need it you know um-hum um-hum rather than you know something being broken um-hum um-hum but that's that's the only thing i've returned recently yeah i i've been really lucky knock on wood you know like i say that i haven't had to return anything except this this table when it came out um-hum the top of it was marked and so all i did was replace the top of it you know hm did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store they they gave me well no i didn't go to the store and get it they you know got with the manufacturer and then when it came in then they brought it out and then just took this table top off and replaced it with the other table top um-hum um-hum yeah because i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and uh i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in um-hum um-hum so i sent it in and uh you know i didn't really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and uh um-hum i didn't really it didn't really bother me because it was kind of small um-hum but i went ahead and sent something in and uh three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table top and it came by truck um-hum and uh i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself because uh it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the whole it was a like a computer table you know made with just like uh uh what do they call pressed board or whatever just pressed particle board oh really uh-huh yeah with or with a veneer top or something like that probably yeah right and uh the tole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks uh-huh and they spent eighty five dollars shipping this top back to me oh for crying out loud so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know uh do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that um-hum um-hum but uh i couldn't believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me just sent it to you that's weird you'd think that they would have wrote a letter or at least a telephone call you know telling you that this is what was happening you know yeah yeah definitely yeah yeah uh um-hum um-hum yeah but but um you know but um oh well but i'd say that's a kind of a short topic this time yeah i was just i was just trying to think of um what else have i bought the only other thing that when we moved in this house it was a new house and the grate where you have your fireplace um-hum right  well Liz do you own a boat well my family has a has a sailboat and we haven't actually been out in in it in a while um but we do um-hum um where do you sail at there's a lake uh right at by our airport here in Dallas and uh Lake Grapevine and um actually i have not done much sailing i had uh i would i have crewed in it but i've never really gotten to where i feel comfortable you know doing the whole thing myself and had all kinds of plans to go out and take lessons and do it and uh for a while there we had flooded lakes and didn't have a chance to so i haven't done that yet how how large is your boat i'm trying to remember uh probably uh i really can't remember uh it's a boat that my sister and i had told my father who's in his seventies we had said you know maybe uh it would be nice maybe sometime we'd like to learn more about sailing and um he he who he is the one who loves sailing and he's the one who's been in it and he just went out and bought a boat uh we didn't mean it that seriously so he went out and bought one he is not fun to sail with it is always a crisis and so um um-hum he turned me off against it when i was young and then later different men men that i have known have had boats and and they made it fun but um he doesn't that's too bad we've got we've got a boat it isn't a sail boat my i should say my family does also uh-huh it's a it's a fishing and ski boat it'll hold about seven people uh-huh but we have a lot of fun uh every year we get together for a a week down on a place uh it's uh it's kind of a resort we have a time share down there and take the boat and water ski and and go fishing early in the mornings when the water's cold and oh i bet that's fun it's a lot of fun and even the little kids uh enjoy it i've got uh a six year old and and of course some of the other family has some around eight or ten and we have a great big oh it'll hold about probably five or six kids that size it's a big uh-huh kind of like a a a water weenie that floats in the water and they can all get on it at once oh oh how fun and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them around and yeah yeah uh we burn up a tank or two of gas a day and get a really good sunburn and just have a great time i bet i bet but my experience with boating and at at least that way i don't know the sailing might be different i i don't know i think i'd kind of be too impatient to uh to sail but uh i don't know it might be kind of fun too just to uh relax and i guess it's all wind powered isn't it when you sail it is uh you you can have a motor on it and and a lot of them do i uh just because if you get out there and there's no wind it's pretty hard to get back um-hum i find it very relaxing i i think they're they're absolutely beautiful i you know i really as i say would like to learn to do it myself just got turned off early on by um a particular manner but um it's a wonderful feeling my son and and and can sail and he and i have gone out but he likes to cut it right right to the when you're going along with the wind you you you can get you can decide how much you want to heel and he loves to take it as far over as possible hm i find that so that's additional speed when you're is that what you yeah the closer to the wind you are uh-huh then you've seen sailboats out where they're just way over yes and that's they're just moving right on out um-hum and uh that's his favorite way um even to the point where you've got to have someone on the up side you know putting some weight on there so you don't go over i see and you always get to be the one that's hanging over the edge well you know i mean since he's doing the other there you know where am i supposed to go so that that is not my favorite but um a friend who um i dated um years back uh and and i would go out and that was just wonderful you'd um-hum sure hm you know take some take a picnic and and go out and you can go in little coves and and it's so quiet it's it that that's something i love i mean i i like ski boats too um-hum hm and the speed and you know going around but there's something extremely peaceful about a sail boat well do you just drop an anchor when you find a place or do you just kind of let it go and you do take an anchor then and yeah yeah yeah drop an anchor and you know there've been the times when the anchor catches in something and you get um-hum uh oh spend a lot of time yeah trying to get it back up et cetera but uh cut the rope huh how how large is your boat how many how many people could go on it at once um really comfortably about four adults um-hum and uh are are they set up so you can spend the night in them and well not this one but but some are there's so many  okay okay do you uh do any woodworking i do and i really love it um oh um what do you do for a hobby or for uh-huh i do it for a hobby um-hum and i have my own equipment and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and uh in the process of getting a router um-hum and so i like to cut out my wood and then tole paint on the items that i cut out what kind of things do you like to do with wood well i'm not the one that cuts them out my husband cuts them out but um uh-huh he likes using the little band saws and jig saws more than the stroll saw because the stroll saw is uh-huh is a lot slower uh-huh and then um he's got a router but now he wants a plunge router oh yeah but anyhow he cuts them out and then i i took a tole painting class oh um-hum to learn how to paint them right you know um-hum and what we wanna do is you know make them and then maybe take them to these craft shows or flea market things and see and see if we can sell some of them uh-huh yes but uh i really like it so far oh that is fun and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood so i took a pattern off of that um-hum and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face and then you you make the dress for it uh-huh and you drill holes around the top of the head and you you stick in uh like rope oh uh-huh the twine and tie ribbons around it it looked really cute you know so i've got a couple of those started yeah those are so cute they are really cute yeah and then uh but as far as wood work that's all we've been doing right now oh that is that sounds really fun i love those well they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden Utah um-hum and i just got back from that today so if you could get your projects into boutiques oh they are wonderful um-hum you could make a lot of money from those what do you do i wonder how you you just they buy them from you or you just give them to them on consignment or something uh apparently with that boutique um they take oh what was it twenty percent of the sell price you would put your sell price um-hum um-hum um-hum uh and then they would take twenty percent off of that um i see at the counter and so and then at the end of the boutique which usually runs for a week um-hum um-hum then they give you what you earned um-hum um-hum so you have to decide what your price is going to be and then um-hum up it twenty percent so you can get what you need out of it um-hum so if the customers are willing to pay it then you get a profit yeah these little things are so cute though you know they are i i have seen those those are darling i i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop you know and uh there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out in fact i just sent to Shop Smith um-hum oh back in Ohio for a rocking horse pattern oh oh that's what i want is a Shop Smith that's my ultimate yeah we well Gene's got one of those too oh does he oh that's my ultimate dream oh you're lucky yeah so anyhow yeah well uh he's retired now and um um-hum i'm kind of semi retired my company went bankruptcy so i'm drawing my pension from them but i'm still looking for a part time job you know oh yeah oh oh uh-huh but um he has all day long that he can you know work on this stuff and oh how fun do do cut outs like that you know and he's got a lot a lot of tools so oh how nice i'm jealous it's just it's just getting started you know yes but um these little wooden things they seem to sell really good um i know a lot of people that have gotten them you know um-hum my next door neighbor every time she sees something she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it you know uh-huh oh so i'm just hoping that you know that we can get some cut out and painted you know before summer summer starts because we don't want to have garage sales or anything like that in the winter time you know uh-huh oh uh-huh but um well how is the market for things like that in California it seems it seems like they go real good you know i mean the country anyhow out here and i live out in the valley and country seems to be the in thing out here uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh you know everybody wants little country pieces so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want you know yeah hum-um they just snap it right up huh oh and uh this little rabbit that i made in uh tole painting class you know is like a welcome it's got a it's gonna have little wooden hearts holding it in its hands and then welcome written on those little wooden hearts um-hum oh and  a tough one yes it is i know well i i believe in it would you like to begin uh-huh do you feel like there should be any kinds of restrictions on when it's i think uh yes i do think that but i do think that i believe in it whole heartedly i really think that a lot of crime we have the criminal obviously you know element is just unreal i work in a high school here uh-huh uh-huh and it just boggles my mind what's happened over the last few years really do you mean even with adolescents you know i've been there fifteen sixteen years and just watching the mentality of our teenagers and and this tough stuff that's going on now you know uh-huh do you feel that it should be applied to them as well then same kind of laws or i uh well i think that they should tougher laws for the teenagers yes i do believe that not but not the uh capital punishment for them um-hum um-hum i really don't feel that but i do feel tougher laws but some way i feel they have to uh revise our criminal system you think it's too lenient over all um-hum i really do and i think that the um oh rehab is terrible you know they put them in there and there's too it's just because of numbers though i understand the rehab is so big that they can't yeah but any way back to capital punishment i do believe in it for murderers and and especially um uh-huh oh you know when they actually thinking about it is that number one manslaughter something like that oh premeditated you mean versus uh uh-huh uh-huh i i don't know i'm not real sure premeditated right murder definitely of course i do feel that and then these at this point most capital punishment is really uh related to murder though right i mean there's no capital punishment unless a life has been lost um-hum um-hum i think i think that's the right right right and um i wonder something i mean i believe as you do that something needs to change but i wonder sometimes what what makes an impact on criminals that do this kind of a crime i mean it it almost seems like they either don't believe it'll ever be them that's caught or if they do they don't really value their lives enough to care if they would lose their lives um-hum that's true it's it's i i'm not even sure i i feel uh in between i guess i'm i'm not sure that i have a strong commitment either direction because um-hum i don't know enough about what what would motivate these people you know i do think that they are some times um right put in a rehabilitation program when there's really a very small chance of rehabilitation that that they're coddled for too long and they get the kind of courtesies of our society that that right um-hum the homeless would love to have you know something's wrong here yes yes that's right that's for sure but it's a tough one well and sometimes the uh on the rehab uh i've just from being around the students that i'm around they know how to talk to the authorities they know exactly what to say to anybody in a in in what respect uh they know the right answers you know like what's within their legal rights or do you mean how to manipulate the system right what's well what's within their legal rights and how to manipulate them uh-huh and how to manipulate them just just they they answer to authority and to people to adults and that type of thing that they have to answer to or even the criminals do in to the people that count the judges and that type of thing you know they they usually answer to them um-hum um-hum in a way that like i said manipulative they just manipulate they've manipulated manipulated so long so this is so they feign for example that they're really are um apologetic or what ever for their crime but they're um-hum right and sorry right and very very sorrowful and then when they get out then we run into the problem of getting right back into a routine again of the same thing but but you know that they aren't um-hum um-hum i'm sure that's easily learned if they don't get it from their peers they get it from going through the system one time being in juvenile court or what ever so um-hum um-hum do you know if there's much of a difference between the law i'm i'm embarrassed to say i don't know between Texas and California what what difference is there i really don't myself i really don't i know they permit it here but i don't know you know the difference in it actually hum uh-huh yeah in fact we just had um a person put to death uh about three weeks ago was in in Texas and i forget for the reason now oh it was for the uh that clergy that he murdered he murdered a uh uh-huh a uh it was a priest i believe he murdered oh my uh-huh it is interesting to look at other cultures other countries and see how different their rates are you know you look at even um um-hum countries like Saudi Arabia where there's a lot of emotion and sometimes an  okay well do you have any pets yes i do uh uh in fact i'm living with three cats at the moment uh one of them is mine one of them is my daughter's and one of them is um partially mine and partially hers i guess ah uh so um i i'm and i'm an absolute nut about cats um i didn't i used to have dogs and cats um and uh the dogs have died and those original cats have died and we've taken these on and uh i i just love them i think they're wonderful what about you we have uh one dog no kids and one dog so um we uh-huh what what kind of dog we have a Golden Retriever oh we that's what we had yeah we loved them yeah oh really yeah she's a mess yeah they uh we had as i say two and then uh gave uh the kids' grandparents one and they got another one and so i mean there've been four sort of in the family around they're sweet dogs wow yeah they i mean they go through a a terror a time yeah how old um she's let's see i guess she's about eleven months oh well yes you still you're still at the puppy stage yeah so she's yeah and they say they stay puppies for a couple of years so yes you're right um but she you know we took her through obedience school back when at four four or five months uh-huh and then we had her fixed at around seven months because i couldn't handle her um-hum being in heat and all that yeah yes i was so worried the whole time that you know a dog was going to jump the fence and yeah right and we decided that we weren't going to breed her and and stuff because there we felt there were enough dogs and right and that's true all ours are fixed too and uh so um we went ahead and had her fixed while she was in heat and um yeah yeah yeah but she's she's pretty smart although she you know she gets angry and she's just like a child when she um oh if she's so into what she's doing you know she won't listen to you listen to a command listen to a command well like um oh really okay i'm trying to think of an example if we're sitting on the couch and she wants to play with you and you say no you know off uh-huh and then she'll she'll come and stick one paw up and then you take her paw and set it off well she starts doing it and she gets frustrated that you're telling her no so it turns into this this uh almost a fight you know it's like you can't tell me that you know so she starts losing her patience and then we lose our patience yeah yeah what does she do when she loses her patience um i mean does she bite or bark or um no she bites a lot but i mean it's sometimes it's it's not angry but sometimes it is oh that's unusual because they don't usually bite yeah yeah they well she's real mouthy you know and that's one thing i think with being retrievers is um uh-huh you know everything goes into their mouth and and she just wants attention but she gets angry that you're not giving her the attention right uh-huh uh-huh and then when you you know like like she goes and steals things um oh we have to keep the doors to our bedrooms closed and she'll go in and if she gets in there she'll go in and pick a teddy bear off this little rocking chair uh-huh oh really and she'll bring it in and she'll kind of show it to she'll stand there until you see her and then as soon as you see her she takes off and it's like come get me oh my goodness well ours didn't do that ours were much quieter but i had i did have a child at the time and so it may be that the child was sort of all this other stuff for them i don't know yeah yeah i think so and also having other dogs or having other animals uh yes we we we have found that with with all of our pets is that we we've never had just one because we somehow feel like they need another one i don't know if that's a human thought and not an animal thought or what but no i think it's a animal thought too because they do tend to be pack dogs you know yeah um-hum um-hum and they because she loves uh we have a neighbor down the street that has a dog and um we there's lots of dogs in our neighborhood but the one down the street she just goes crazy over i mean you'd think that that dog was Elvis or something she just goes hog wild over that dog and yeah yeah and um they have a lot of fun together but she doesn't do that with other dogs it's just that one one friend yeah yeah well and i i think they they can be territorial so you you know have to maybe some of them they're more comfortable with than others but but we did get her though because we'd heard that they were good with kids so oh they and then they are i mean my son would just you know and and you've heard the stories i'm sure but you know everything from using his little wooden hammer on her head to all sorts of things and um she would just move over you know i mean and that was that was the worst that ever happened yeah  okay all right that's a real different topic i'm not sure i'm familiar with with what they mean of invasion of privacy i know i guess that i guess you consider just things that every day that would you'd think of about see i'm a college student so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me yeah you know that i think's like is an invasion of my privacy stuff like that but i think it'd be it is kind of a tough topic yeah i think personally you know i'm i'm i used to be a college student ten years ago but uh now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and says Mrs Miller have we got a deal for you oh gosh you're like no you don't no it's like how do you know my name where did you get my phone number and why do you think it's a deal for me uh-huh i mean those people they'll call you any time of the day or night with try to solicit and that's an invasion of my privacy i think yeah they call late now i mean now there's i heard that they were going to start calling on Saturdays or something oh they do already see that's ridiculous i would be so mad well and i've even had the computer generated calls on Sundays too really um-hum huh but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls huh don't answer your phone hello the computer's geared to to start talking to you on the on the word hello really huh i don't know i'd think like things that that i think's like privacy is like just like not going through my stuff but like going through just like my clothes or my drawer just going through my stuff basically uh-huh oh yeah oh yeah that drives me up a wall are you and your roommate a similar size no see we're not and uh and she still goes through your clothes yeah she'll take all my shirts and stuff because she can't wear like my pants but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff uh-huh ooh man i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses you know oh yeah but still she'll just take them and she won't even think about it and then i'll like see her that day and she'll be wearing my clothes and i'll be like you know i don't like to borrow my clothes out you know i really don't uh-huh so i prefer that you just not go in and get them because she doesn't even ask me uh-huh stuff like that really like that's an invasion of my privacy i feel like oh yeah i agree stuff like that when you have your door closed people just walking in and stuff like that um-hum i was thinking like my mom i know this she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy is like going through her purse like if you ever needed money and stuff we always just give her her purse you know and she'll get it out or whatever oh yeah yeah uh-huh i was trying to think i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets really i mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for uh-huh yeah get out of my cabinets yeah like what are you doing don't you have your own house to dig through that's great yeah so i guess that privacy is really and at the work place i suppose oh well actually yes i can say definitely privacy at the work place i hate it for people to open up my drawer to my desk uh-huh see yeah because that was that was where i kept all my stuff and i could tell i mean even if a pen was turned the wrong way oh yeah you could tell you know you put your stuff where it's yeah that would drive that would that it would drive it drove me batty for a while yeah well i worked a second shift really uh-huh and everybody else in my area worked first shift and our shifts overlapped uh-huh uh-huh so i would come in and there would be people sitting at my desk working and i'm wondering you know um what is this it's my vitamins i wonder what is you know yeah what is why are they working at my desk and can i have it back yeah can i have it back soon maybe then you start missing stuff and oh yeah no mommy is going to take the vitamins i'm sorry i have a small person that's okay yeah see that would that would make me really mad because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff just because i mean i know i have everything like a certain way switchboard call and you know how it looks and everything oh yeah well you know how you left it the day before uh-huh that would bother me definitely oh yeah so that's yeah i agree it's it's pretty tough that way and i know even like with your school books and paper uh-huh do you miss your papers sometimes see yeah uh-huh huh you just know that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy like something every day though yeah well actually i do know and i have used it once and it it really is an invasion of privacy but uh-huh in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live by their street address yeah oh really uh-huh and that i mean i've i've used it once  talk in the background she's i don't know what she sees outside well what kind of music do you like oh well well mostly rock rock yeah what about you oh oh everything um well i like well i like different you know different things but uh um primarily you know rock and roll what era of rock and roll or whatever did you prefer oh you know well you i i really like more of the modern stuff you know but i like the oldies you know they're okay but i you know i listen mostly mostly to the you know the modern stations um um i guess we listen to a lot of things um i grew up with the with rock and roll and older brothers and sisters yeah uh-huh and uh so i would i remember always being kind of ahead of my peers just because um you know in third grade i was listening to to groups and stuff that people you know third graders usually aren't interested in music by that time uh-huh yeah and i think now i listen we listen to a variety of stuff um jazz or country and western or see now i don't like country and western uh do you not i don't i don't like the old the old i don't like most you know most of it i don't like but i recently saw that Garth Brooks show yeah and i thought he was terrific and i really thought i mean i thought he was a great you know really wonderful entertainer the way he um he you know he he was very good yeah i i there i think country music i don't like the real old twangy stuff like the i don't like twainese no i non't you know but that it has undergone undergone a lot of change and there's a like there's a guy named Lyle Lovett that he could be considered oh he's really not that uh country i mean i've heard him sing stuff that really doesn't sound too you know but yeah see he does it's more what do they call it i don't know sometimes i've heard it called Rockabilly where it's like rock and roll and or country but um but they refer to him you know as a country singer but a lot of his stuff sounds really jazzy yeah yeah right i yeah i have heard him and uh i didn't think he was a country singer you know i um they i mean they they term him as that but i i know well i've watched like the music awards or the country music awards before and they had him on as a new up and coming country singer yeah uh-huh oh well so it's kind of i mean but there's a lot of people kind of like that that they're they're playing they're right on the line and you know the yeah that's true at the the i guess the rock and roll side might be so saturated that you know they're trying out this and and we've gone country and western dancing before and oh you really but and it when i don't i don't dance i mean country dance that well but you know just watching the people when they get out there is when they start playing the rock and roll music while the band's taking a break oh you know i mean they get out there and jitterbug and or you know whatever you want to call it um-hum and uh so i think there's there's a lot of people out there now that aren't aren't just Johnny Cash fans or or you know or um yeah yeah uh i don't even know what the alternative well you know i said let me watch this and see what all the fuss is about i mean everybody's raving about this guy you know and my son is i have a a son he's uh twenty four and of course he hates country music and he said ma i can't believe you're gonna watch that i said i have to find out my best friend said she likes him i said i if Linda likes him i said he's gonna not he he couldn't be all wrong you know i mean he's there's got to be something good about the guy um-hum yeah so i watched it and really i i just thought he was terrific i saw previews of it and it looked more like a rock and roll concert than a i don't know but i mean and his songs uh uh were you know i liked them uh were they weren't that silly country western stuff that you know they used to do years ago you know with with dopey lyrics you know very simple lyrics yeah yeah and there's still some out there like that too uh you know they're yeah oh there are but uh uh yeah i think as a whole it's gotten more definitely more sophisticated in the you know in the past few years yeah i do too i do too you know but then i wouldn't listen you know listen to it uh you know steadily uh you know i wouldn't listen to it at all actually you know i just don't really care for it any you know it as a whole but uh um-hum um-hum what station do you listen to radio i usually listen to either the uh classic rock it's uh ninety two or or uh one oh two yeah i switch around yeah um and then my husband loves the oldies you know every time he he gets in the car the car he sticks on the oldies station well it's funny because my my father um i'm youngest of six and we all play some type of music interest instrument instrument and i had a couple of brothers that were in rock and roll bands and so forth so you know he was constantly having to grow up with us so at Christmas or his birthday we're always buying him yeah tapes you know to keep him uh-huh  all right well we're supposed to talk about cars right the car that uh probably the kind we'll get next and i uh i do a lot of driving commute uh i have about uh fifty three miles one way to commute here in Utah but it's uh freeway and it's not bad but uh the cars i've been getting i've got a Toyota gosh it's economical now i've got a Honda now and um and it's a five speed yeah and and for the all the driving i do that uh is the kind i i think i'd probably look at next i'm not sure uh-huh well i'll probably look for a family family type vehicle like a van mini van or something because uh-huh i've got two i just uh i've got two young ones so we're we're looking for something that's more family oriented yeah something bigger that we can carry i see a little bit bigger yeah our family's gone we had six children at one time but they've uh they're all gone and so we we can go to the smaller car now but we did have to have back then it was station wagons six yeah right as for a family uh when you start taking much with you or going any place you really need a little more room right i have a son in Plano Texas who has uh four boys and he got a a van and he really enjoys it hum that's that's right near me is it yeah Plano's a few miles north oh okay well he uh i know i've had several from Richardson who who does he work for he works for JC Penney's oh really corporate office uh-huh yes uh-huh huh uh i've got a i'm taking a class and uh one of the guys that's in my uh my group that yeah he we're doing a group presentation he works for JC Penney um-hum well good yeah he uh he's been down there going on three three years now i guess uh-huh three years they're moving their offices to to Plano right right now yes uh-huh they closed at Pittsburgh i think and uh they're moving but it's uh so in fact i was just down there Thursday i was in El Paso and then i had a layover couple hours uh at at Dallas airport well that's good airport and they come out and got to visit with them for a while i got i got a new little brand grandbaby and first time i've seen him but uh well that's great i don't know i looking at cars you you they say buy American but i boy of all the people i've talked to that uh seems like they get a lot better mileage i had a hundred and eighty thousand on the Toyota that i had in eighty and that thing i hadn't had any problems at all it was just going strong when i sold it yeah huh but uh i guess it's just it depends there's lemons in all of them i guess but uh that's super yeah well American cars are hopefully they'll i think the unions really screwed American cars up they uh i do too yeah you know the the price of the cars are just more than incomes are because people are you know the people that work at car manufacturers make well the GM plant or um-hum right yeah or yeah the GM plant that they have down here that they're thinking about closing uh the average worker there makes twenty two dollars an hour and that's you know that's more than a lot of people make salary you know professionals make oh wow i've been yeah i've been working well i that's it i've been working for uh oh thirty five years for the the government and think i've got a pretty good job but i don't make that much yeah i didn't either and i've got uh a a degree and everything else you see and i and i don't know hopefully you you'd think that if they were making that kind of money they would try to have a little pride in yeah in uh the product that they put out so it is a good car but sure uh my family's bought uh my sister bought uh a a Buick paid twenty thousand dollars for it she's had nothing but trouble with that thing yeah and you know you pay that kind of money you should uh it should be trouble free at least for fifty fifty seventy thousand and then sure and uh she's had it in the in the shop garage and shop and she called today and said oh it's uh leaking oil out of the head gasket she's only got about twenty thousand on it yeah so she's got to take that back in and have them work on it but and i and i think it from what i can hear it's just because they uh they don't take the pride that uh the Japanese do or something in in their work or workmanship that when something comes out and their name's on it they want it to to be the best and so i I hate to stay away from American  all right okay so what do you think of the Giants uh i like the Giants they got uh i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe maybe four three years ago really yeah so uh but i i i just like the Giants i don't i don't know why i really got into them i read uh Dave Dreveki's book his autobiography and oh yeah yeah wasn't that something of him yeah that that was incredible yeah that's really a really proud of him though the way he's you know the way he handled that entire situation yeah yeah really you know but i just think the Giants have a good team they they got all you know they're they're real they're real balanced out they got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it so yeah i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top you know yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know i don't really know what it is but but every team that's that's really good seems you know like the A's had they had they just had it all that one year so um-hum yeah um i was mostly an A's fan you know i had been to more games at the A's than i have in the Giants yeah because uh i lived in Oakland you know for some time yeah but uh i still like the Giants though you know yeah if you if you're a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad but yeah right yeah it's it's kind of hard i still well basically the the me and all my friends around here since we don't have anywhere i mean we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since none me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we uh um-hum about the about the most most baseball we get is either TV or we play it on Nintendo we play RBI baseball on Nintendo so so that's just you know that's small town trying to make it through the yeah right right through the lull not being around it really but yeah yeah right well i prefer baseball uh football over baseball but uh yeah yeah so do i but baseball is still yeah it's you got you got to do something when football ain't on so so add hot dogs baseball and apple pie huh yeah exactly this this is America so yeah um so what do you think's gonna happen this year to the teams uh but uh i don't know it's hard to say i haven't really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off season it's kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and i know Sports Illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the Giants can do it yeah well the Giants yeah they just i don't you i don't really know about the A's i don't like the A's uh matter of fact i can't stand the Oakland A's just because they have that you know they've got their Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know the kind of yeah makes you sick doesn't it yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his car wife's car and i i was like yeah see that's just yes he's like a little bitty kid huh yeah he's just a a a little boy with a lot of money so that's just you know but yeah yeah well i guess the Giants or might move away from San Francisco it sounds like yeah i've heard i've heard talk about that you know uh they won't be that far away but San Francisco it'll be hurting anyhow yeah they're not gonna be happy about it you know but i hope they can do good i mean that's just i think they're a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over i don't know exactly what it is they got they're pretty balanced out all the way through it just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them um-hum um-hum um-hum because i that's that's the only thing i can see that's holding them back is the ambition to do it or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it maybe that's what you know that's what some teams need look at the Twins going from worst to first so i know isn't that something you couldn't believe that huh yeah my roommate's a my roommate's a Twins fan forever forever so he had his year this year so yeah i just it we we got quite preoccupied we we got into that a whole bunch that was a that was a series to remember for sure uh-huh uh-huh um-hum so i saw all seven games of that so that was definitely worth watching um-hum yeah yeah i couldn't believe that you know i don't uh there was Braves in that chanting that they have that would drive you up a wall yeah yeah they every every every team with the Indians been doing that now and it and it i can't figure out why i've yet to figure out why they're all doing that i'm like it doesn't work it's obvious it doesn't work because the you know the Braves you know God yeah well you're right the Braves didn't win so uh why why keep on doing something that didn't work but yeah yeah yeah i don't know i was i was kind of surprised that we're gonna talk about baseball and i get a woman's voice i was i was i was thinking uh-huh i talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so oh really yeah i got i called got a call the other night about about fixing your automobile up so um-hum um-hum but well baseball baseball it's it's kind of i don't know it's kind of odd that they'd do you pick the topic or does the computer yeah right no uh they give you a list of things that you want to talk  okay we have uh we have a family reunion every every summer and uh we different uh sides of the family take turns on planning it sending out the invitations and and then uh the activities that we have we kind of get together and have a luncheon or a lunch or a a cookout or barbecue or whatever and uh and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and we really enjoy our our family uh get togethers and family reunions so to speak are you able to do that yes we have ours every three years and uh we have uh relatives in Mexico and Brownsville Texas and Pennsylvania Ohio um oh okay West Virginia Virginia and Florida so we've got them everywhere New Jersey and that's why we only have one every three years so that everybody can get together and we uh have one from early morning it starts at eleven oh wow um-hum and it goes all day and we just had one a year and a half ago we have it every summer in a place called Bare Rocks um-hum its a it was a a resort and it was catered and um i hadn't seen cousins that i hadn't seen for years and others that are new in the family from marriage or well that's really great and uh they're able to come from long distances like that we we have children in Ohio and uh Texas and Germany and Illinois and uh all over but uh they get to some of them but this is uh the ones that live in Utah and but it it's sure great uh those family reunions are really something but um-hum aren't they wonderful at uh uh it's a shame that people can't get together like that more often and and uh have a close family tie it really is because that that really helps and like say to get to know each other and the background and we uh we the one that we have every year uh we go up to uh go up into the canyon and camp out for uh over the weekend and uh it we uh-huh have a bonfire and uh sit around and in the evening and uh around the pine trees in the pine trees in the mountains and uh yeah the atmosphere's just really nice and then the kids get to play with each other and it uh it's a super thing uh that sounds like fun we only have ours for that one day and uh um-hum then we make plans who's going to have the next one where it's going to be and all that and the next one i believe is going to be in New Jersey next year uh-huh so um do you have a large family uh we have uh there's probably about uh our own own family there is we had six children but we have uh my wife's side of the family is the one that we go up to uh Idaho up in the canyon and uh there's probably about uh forty people there and uh total and then we do have another get together at Christmas time on my side of the family and uh this last one we had eighty five people to that one uh-huh well that's good how many was in your family uh we have uh i had five uh four brothers and one sister and then on my wife's side of the family she had uh four sisters and uh a brother uh-huh and so we're kind of from large families and then they're all married and all have their children and they come and uh so it's it's really quite a get together we've been doing this uh up in Idaho in the summer in the camp out for uh we're thirty nine years every summer we've done this and we do it the second week in July between the Fourth of July and the twenty fourth of July which is a holiday here in Utah um-hum what's the holiday it's uh when the pioneers came into Utah and settled uh Utah Brigham Young came in on the twenty fourth of July oh and when they came across they came from the east in the covered wagons and uh settled or started the settlement of Salt Lake City so is there a special uh type of festivities for that occasion too yeah uh they have uh we have uh a large parade in Salt Lake City it's probably the one of the biggest parades in the country it goes for about three or four hours um and uh of course uh it's a state holiday and so we uh we have ours between that and uh the week between those the fourth and twenty fourth and so every year we know  hi Vicky hi uh been wondering what you've been wearing to work lately well i tell you what my going to work clothes has changed over a period of years i used to work in an office and i would and i thought that i would have to have a lot of clothes because when you go and work around a lot of people for some reason i just felt the need to have a a nice variety and look and look different uh-huh now i work in an office in my home and i'm doing office work and i go out and call on people in their homes i sell insurance uh-huh so i could wear the same thing every single day and it really wouldn't make any difference so and sometimes i do that it's just very very strange and different that's that must be nice it's a different feeling i get up and i i dress as i would go out to an appointment even if i'm going to stay in my office for most of the day or half of the day i just get up and get dressed like i was going you know out yeah but it is this strange feeling to really realize that i really don't need a large wardrobe that's right and um that i can go and and i could wear the very same thing every single day that's neat how how do you do what oh i usually wear dresses or suits i work as an engineer yeah well i i wear dresses or suits too and mine doesn't really vary that much from season to season uh i guess i wear a little less in the summer time a little more in the winter right right you know or with a suit i i tend to wear a sweater in the winter as opposed to a blouse in the summertime um-hum have you always lived in this area no no i grew up in New Mexico and spent several years in Ohio going to school um-hum well it seems to me like maybe fifteen years ago i've always lived in this area and it seems like about fifteen to twenty years ago i would see more of a significant difference in the seasons and um i had a tendency to really buy wool clothes for the winter and really make a a definite change uh-huh and it seems like the last few years i've had a tendency to even though i want to continue that it's just kind of been a pattern i have i really don't wear my wool clothes any more so i've really had to make a concerted effort to buy lighter weight clothing and and and now most of my suits will wear all all year around yeah i think it's a lot of that is because of the fabrics have changed so much well it i'm i it i just wonder if it's the fabrics or if if there's been that much change in in uh the seasons it seems to me like we're not having as cold a weather in this area as we used to have many years ago yeah well i've been in the Dallas area for about fifteen years and i remember some ice storms and there was nothing you could wear to be warm enough right but uh you know i i've got all these woolens from Ohio uh because well i wore a heavy coat and a scarf and gloves and a hat all that stuff yeah yeah long underwear when i was going to classes right well i just i had a trip to uh Colorado in December and i took really you know warm clothes in fact i bought a down jacket so that i would have something warm enough and i didn't need anything i mean it just happened to be the week that i was there it was just really nice and pleasant so um-hum now i've got a nice new London Fog down jacket that i'll probably never wear unless i go back to to uh Colorado and the weather's bad yeah well i remember who you are now yeah i've placed you it's hard sometimes isn't it right right but that's funny too i haven't talked to as many of these calls as we've made i haven't uh talked to anybody else in the Altrusa club before i have i talked to Susan Linnstaedter is that right i'll be darned well um yes but we didn't get to talk about clothing yeah well right well um hum i was trying to think of something else that we might talk about about clothing well do you do you i was wondering about when you dress for the day like if you have a club meeting that evening just keep wearing the same thing i usually do yes i do too i just don't change uh and a lot of times i come in and in the evenings and i change directly to you know like what i'm sleeping in and my robe yeah that's terrible but i just it seems like there's only a few hours there and i just want to be totally relaxed of course if i know uh if i know i going to go out or run to the store or something well i'll just i'll put on something i you know jeans or sweats or something like that but normally i do that about three or four times a week is just come in and  hi i'm Bridgette Bridgette i'm Jackie it's nice to meet you and nice to meet you are you um where are you from i'm in Lubbock and what's that where's that it's in west Texas oh i'm from Wisconsin Kenosha yeah i'm not very familiar with Texas oh really oh my gosh yeah i'm far well is that where you are right now yeah i i live in Kenosha Wisconsin oh my gosh i didn't know i'd get someone that far away yeah i i've gotten a lot of people from Texas and they're always like wow Wisconsin i know that's i was like oh my gosh so we're supposed to talk about music okay i'll push one then uh-huh okay okay okay all right ah what kind of music do you like um i listen to all sorts of music really i think uh i like a lot of country oh yeah is that really popular in Texas or is that just like a stereotype because it's the south um i think it's pretty popular i mean it is probably like a huge stereotype but i think it's pretty popular too what kind of music do you like is it oh um well i used to not really like country that much but i think but what my dad really likes it uh-huh and i used to listen to that and the older i got the more it you know i i can listen to it but um i prefer um um hm groups like i like um Firehouse uh-huh and Slaughter and um Scorpions um the Scorpions uh-huh so you like more hard rock yeah yeah yeah but i also like the top forty too and i really like the oldies station like um fifties music uh-huh really yeah and and um The Doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and The Who i i really like all kinds i uh-huh that's how i am too do you like any rap music um no that's about the only kind i don't get into is like rap and like classical and um yeah i don't either jazz is all right but um like the blues and stuff like that i i like to dance and if it's like a upbeat you know good song then then i'll listen to it and if i'm out you know dancing then makes it better to listen to uh-huh so you like mostly like uh do you like hard rock the best yeah um there's this station called The Blaze from Chicago and that's my favorite because they yeah they play um all different kinds of um harder rock really uh-huh well i'm from Dallas and uh um-hum oh i've been there hm um-hum have you they have hard rock stations there i don't even think they have a hard rock station in Lubbock i pretty sure they don't if they if they do i've never come across it oh really no um-hum but they only have i mean they don't have really it's really small and uh they don't have that really many radio you know like top forty stations even oh really uh oh yeah oh that's neat uh-huh me too yeah yeah it's more like a college town so yeah because i'm in college cool so um i mean i don't think gah they had a i don't think they do have a hard rock station here hm see you don't here very often and you never have like bands come you never have them like come up to we're up here you know oh really we get a lot like at the bars because um we have a lot of like bands that form by themselves like from Milwaukee and Chicago trying to get started you know to the big top and yeah oh really see that's great you would never see that here no i don't think you would oh really uh-huh i think a lot of music has to do with like you know the type of people you hang around with and especially your environment like you know the settings like the bigger cities you get more variety i think you know yeah see yeah see i think most people listen to country up here being it's so far like in the panhandle of Texas and stuff oh yeah uh i've gotten to like um a couple of songs from Garth Brooks do you i know he's great i like him a lot yeah i i just um heard of him this year my boyfriend um he uh likes some types of country music and he was listening to that and it uh-huh see i only know very few too even i mean i only know like Garth Brooks and like George Straight and a few of the top the really good guys i like Garth Brooks i really like him he's really good um-hum yeah yeah i i've liked most the songs i heard so that was good uh-huh you have to kind of get used to it though because i didn't like country western really for a while and even when i came up here i didn't listen to it until like last year then i started listening to it a lot and then then you like it a lot yeah same here oh yeah uh i just started um listening to it too because my boyfriend but yeah after i heard it a while at first i didn't like it and then i heard it and then i'm like oh this isn't so bad you know it's it's you know upbeat and you know i got into it and i saw on TV one time um they were playing Garth Brooks and they were um showing how to country dance to it and it looked so fun because like i say i like to dance and it was just really neat oh really uh-huh oh yeah you would like two stepping then yeah it it looked fun i'm like oh i wanna learn now i know i wanted to i wanna learn to because we can do it but we're not very good oh yeah we're just like oh yeah we kind of fake it you know so i wanna take lessons because i think that'd be so fun i think oh yeah  well what kind of fishing do you do down there Lisa bass fishing in fact we just came from a tournament this weekend huh bass is that right how'd you do how did you do well i weighed in a fish my husband didn't so i'm ahead of him right now huh uh do you is it a two day event or this one was just a one day sometimes we have two days hm um-hum it's uh with the TI Bass Club huh did how how do those tournaments work you know i've seen them on television and stuff uh so uh-huh but um um is it based on the total pounds of fish that you can catch or how do they do it yeah yeah it's based on the total pounds and you go according to the lake rules like most lakes you can't weigh one in that's under fourteen inches i see and so i got one that was just fourteen inches so i weighed it in it was a little over a pound um do they have men and women's divisions or is it just all everybody in our in our club it's men and women mixed we have a lot of couple's teams i see so it's the you do it as a joint combination well we have the individual uh you weigh in as individuals and then you uh combine your totals as a team so they award prizes for individual and team uh-huh i see do you do you fish for a particular team like TI like you were telling me or so yeah in our club we um uh the Lewisville TI we have our club and we all fish together once a month and then once a year we get together with the rest of the TI bass clubs and we compete as as a club against the others um-hum huh that sounds fun yeah we have good time do you fish for anything besides bass no hum-um sometimes at night we'll go out crappie fishing but just to be going out it's not a tournament or anything what kind do you do um-hum yep uh mainly salmon and steel head king uh king salmon chinook and oh i i enjoy a little bit of trout fishing fly fishing out of float tubes on high mountain lakes i enjoy that that's probably my favorite uh-huh uh-huh ooh how fun yeah that's a lot of fun that is a lot of fun um uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah but the king the king salmon fishing too is fun too we i got to Alaska this year most of the time we just spend fishing around here but wow um-hum that was a lot of fun we got into some really nice fishing um-hum i bet uh one night i went down on a river called the Kishloff River uh-huh and they were catching uh red salmon they're smaller salmon uh-huh but i started fishing about eleven o'clock at night and i fished until three o'clock in the morning and i must have caught twenty salmon uh-huh wow and it was just great it was about every fifth cast you'd hook one and uh-huh and they were anywhere between eight and twelve fifteen pounds and wow it just wonderful the the water was very swift and fast and and so uh the fish were even with twenty pound test line i was breaking them off uh you know quite frequently uh-huh uh-huh so but that that's probably the best fishing i've been in in my whole life was that night there wow that sounds neat huh yep have have you ever uh have you ever been salmon fishing at all um in Lake Lake Michigan they have salmon there okay um-hum yes uh-huh you troll with them troll for them uh-huh uh-huh yeah we uh we were up there one year for a family reunion and it we went out on Lake Michigan and but the weather was so bad we couldn't go out very far and we didn't stay out very long at all huh so my husband got one and the rest of didn't get anything so uh-huh well if you ever get a chance to go to Alaska boy uh the the oh i would love to the the biggest problem is you get hooked on it now you know so uh i can't i can't make it next year but in ninety three i'm sure trying to go back and uh-huh you just it's almost like you can't get your fill of it it is it is so it's just nothing like what we're we've got around here uh-huh and uh the halibut fishing was great we went out in the ocean one day and actually two days and they got us over a bed of halibut wow uh-huh and there was three of us in the boat fishing and probably every five minutes somebody had a halibut on wow it was great they weren't very big the biggest one we caught that day was thirty five pounds but uh uh it just lots and lots of action uh-huh wow and uh so i really enjoyed that yeah you ever been deep sea fishing just the halibut that's they they bottom fish for halibut but no i haven't have have you uh-huh we yeah we've been a couple of time well i just went once and i got so seasick i never went back uh-huh but we go uh in Mexico and uh we caught one trip we caught four well there was four of us and we got four um sailfish and a dolphin yes um-hum um and that i've heard that sailfish are a lot of fun to catch oh it was that was the first fish i'd ever caught  okay yeah the topic is uh car repairs and the last one i've had done it was a fluke the last one i had done right uh-huh what happened well i was driving down six thirty five at the um coming from North Dallas uh-huh and i was uh going um almost hitting the um entry where all the the merges go from six thirty five seventy five and Coit and uh all of a sudden i get this liquid all over my hood and my windshield yeah and i had smelled it before i thought and i thought that it was coming from another vehicle and then when i saw it go all over my car i thought oh oh something came through my radiator and just something's wrong inside my car so i i was waiting for my car to collapse you know i go i was going about sixty five miles an hour and it kept going and i thought well what is going on and so i made it home and i looked at my car and it was a mess so i immediately the next morning i took it to my dealer and i i left it just how i drove it in the the night before and he says well it looks like your uh antifreeze uh something happened to your antifreeze huh and they checked everything in that car and it wasn't from my car it was from some other car some other car did that to me well i'm glad but it was a very panicky situation some other car had too well isn't that something well oh sure right but no i do not do any of my own repairs the only thing i do to my car is put gas in it and wash it well i do i do some of my own repairs yes i do i i have learned to do this oh you do well good for you that's great that uh my husband drives uh sports cars races he races them as a hobby oh i see oh well he probably showed you all the tricks of the trade that's great yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um sure most in fact i have changed out a whole engine in uh one of sons' trucks you did well bless your heart yes i took the whole thing out and i fixed it but i think it's really important to know these things if you can well i think that's wonderful i mean i think that's great but uh but now if i could talk him into doing this i'll let him do it i've told him i've learned how but well gee you should uh you know you should get some money for your talents and start branching out no i don't think i wanna work on too many people's cars that's hard work i think they earn their money i do it is oh well you know uh loosening those nuts and bolts would be a problem for me right and i know they have some really sophisticated equipment today where they do it electronically and all that but that takes money to buy those kind of tools too yes it does now i i don't think i will be able to work on you know too many cars much longer because they are sophisticated and i just can't fool with these computers and things that they have in it that um-hum um-hum right yeah no i wouldn't want my i wouldn't want anybody to touch my car without having all the the yeah the uh computer and all and everything the proper tools right that's but it uh i had just gotten a new car this year and i i take it back to the dealer i take this one to the dealer because you have that uh as a as a gift to you don't you that they do it for you for gratis yes right uh-huh at least this first year and uh uh-huh right well i have a woman's agreement on mine and they they did it for three years oh well that's nice yeah yeah that really was nice so i uh appreciated that uh a present that they gave me uh-huh well that that is really good but i can't think of any offhand um problems we have really had lately you know that we've had to fix uh the one thing we have problem with is our electricals anything that goes electrical wrong with the cars we don't even try to fool with those ourselves oh um-hum right and uh those to me they're very difficult to locate the problem if you well don't they have if you that they hook it up to the computer and the computer does the analysis and tells you what's wrong with with different areas yeah yeah well right they can do that with the new ones uh-huh with these newer cars you can do that and uh um-hum but other than that the the oil changes and the gases water and antifreeze i do keep that in there well i i have put windshield washer solvent in the container but and yeah have you ever changed a windshield wiper no i have not this one hasn't needed any thus thus far yeah yeah um it's been a super car it's uh let's see it's uh three years old oh well good what kind is it it's it's a Plymouth Acclaim uh-huh well good i really like it it's a been a very dependable um no maintenance i have not had  hello hi uh hi i'm Bill from Raleigh i'm Bridgette i'm in Lubbock where's that at it's up in west Texas west Texas okay up in the panhandle your the first person i talked to from Texas i've been getting phone calls from all over the country yeah have you really that's great Washington state and Oregon and i forgot where all else Pennsylvania New York God i wish i would get i always get people from Texas i'm i i i just i never call anybody i just let them call me do you that's probably why i always call because i figure it's easier that way yeah than trying to catch me at home well okay are you ready for me to push one okay sure okay what kind of exercise do you do or do you do any um i do some not a lot i'm kind of lazy um well i am a couch potato yeah i know how that is i do play like racquetball a lot that's fun i like that the best i've never played racquetball no uh you haven't well i'm in college and i took it as a class like last semester and i just loved it i thought it was great it's really a lot of fun uh-huh it's not real hard now i'm taking like weight training and i hate it it's so dumb i've tried weight training i just i just can't get into it no it really it seems so pointless and it well i don't like having the sore muscles i like to run jog do you yeah i i used to jog about six miles a day and then i i tore the ligaments in my ankle so i i don't really run that much but i i i jog some about a mile or so now oh my gosh uh-huh when i have time yeah i know i'm not real into like aerobics are anything like that only exercise when i have to i mean yeah that's that's basically me you know i'm kind of i'm really bad about it i'm i'm i exercise more in in the summer and spring than i do um like this time of year because yeah when the weather's nicer is it really it it's too cold here yeah well i i i think forty degrees is too cold so yeah little cold for you i know that's how i am too because i i love going outside and stuff when it's warmer and stuff but otherwise i won't i mean i won't go work out or i won't jog i won't go outside i'll just stay at home you know on the couch watching TV or renting movies or something yeah that's that's basically what i do i like i like to um to walk too i i guess they said it's a good form of exercise i guess uh if you consider that exercise i walk a lot yeah do you but i i have such a normal fast pace so it i don't really i don't really think it's it it's it's nothing or it could be your exercise for the week right right i because i mean i i've always walked fast so i i don't know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because i'm i'm starting to gain weight i'm getting at that age where you don't need to start putting on the pounds oh listen to you uh-huh they'll catch up with you yeah it it has caught up with me in the past year or so i've i've put on about twelve pounds so i need to work and get it off i thought about doing a diet but i really don't need to diet i i just need to really exercise exercise i think yeah it sort of that does make you feel better though i had to admit that you know after yeah because when i get off work i usually come home and fix dinner and watch TV and then i'm tired i take a nap whatever yeah yeah see after work i don't know i think if i worked all day there's no way i would do anything oh i work i work eight to five so i mean yeah so then when you're home you're like okay i just want to relax and not think about work and definitely not exercise you want to eat right i i do accounting and and it's on a computer all day and i'm so brain dead when i get off work it's kind of like just don't even talk to me just let me sit here and vegetate so yeah you're probably drained and probably exercising probably wouldn't help well i don't i don't know i they say once you once you get in a routine of exercising it gives you a lot more energy energy i know when i ran um i kind of got like addicted to it uh-huh you know you see these people um i never was die hard you know they they had a story on the news about uh people becoming addicted it's like uh people that do drugs it's it's a high for them that have to do it see i've heard that i've got a couple uh uh a real good friend of mine that i went to school with lives here too she works for The News and Observer and she's the one who got me started running in in college and i i was never uh-huh die hard like she was it was we had a sleet storm and she was outside running in it icicles hanging down and all this other kind of stuff and i i told her she was crazy but she runs about thirteen miles now oh my gosh yeah oh my gosh she's really training and i when we were in college we both chain smoked like freight trains and she would get out and run everyday and it never would bother her and it's like it don't bother me uh-huh hm and her husband made her stop after she got married her husband made her stop so so now she's just like really that'd be like channeling all of her energy into running now yeah that's good though but i just God  okay Janet do you guys have a family budget we try to like mothers i'm sitting i'm right this minute dishing up cheap spaghetti which is one way we try and keep within a budget uh-huh uh-huh it's probably why we're participating too right although i'm trying to raise money for a boy scout cause um actually how we do it is my husband and i both work and we try very hard to live on his salary and my salary goes automatically into a savings account which we try not to use too much although from that we both definitely we typically pay our credit cards from that account um-hum um-hum so that's the that's the uh our household expenses are pretty well covered because they're pretty much the same every month but it's our credit card spending that it's always the problem yep is the cost of living uh high down there is it tough to i don't know what to compare it to i lived in Indiana and Saint Louis but i was a student then and you know when you're a student things don't mean much um i think Dallas is um i know it's just a yeah um-hum right relatively high priced homes but then there's not i think energy and some of the other things aren't quite so high um-hum and i my my gestalt is that our groceries are sort of intermediate there're not as bad as i have seen in big cities like New York or California areas um-hum how about you um the cost of living here is cheap in in fact it's really great we've got a a quite a nice home we've got a five bedroom home home with a basement in it and it cost me through let me see four years ago it cost me fifty five thousand so it's great i mean uh uh that is where are you from originally right here in Idaho from from Idaho yes i've got a brother in law in Plano Texas and that's how we got hooked up with this uh TI deal but it's well i don't know anyone from Idaho i'm from Indiana um and i have a great love for the Midwest um-hum would go back in a minute if i could but i married a Texan um-hum they don't always tell you that they have a homing instinct well that's good um-hum but i our home uh we have a five bedroom home um but it's more in the range of with around two hundred forty thousand yeah so about four and a half times your home i'm sure they're probably quite comparable yeah right yeah or maybe i don't know ours is nice our home is nicely located but i don't think the house itself is um-hum yeah well i i wouldn't uh mine's not nicely located i probably got a bargain i think more particularly extraordinary how about budget wise how how do you do a family budget are you married um-hum yes i am and my wife is very meticulous about budgeting she has a computer program in fact i'm an accountant i'm a CPA i'm calling you from work tonight uh but uh my wife runs every single check she spends through a computer and she can tell me on a monthly basis and she's more interested not me in fact i only look at it once a year when i do our we do our taxes but she can tell you every month exactly what she's paid for groceries and uh utility bills and for gasoline in the cars and everything she's uh uh my husband tries very hard to do that for us and we used the Managing Your Money software package with Andrew Tobias he is familiar with that one uh-huh um yeah i'm not i'm not uh-huh well i mean now i'm sure there are a million software packages but um he tried very hard and we were all computerized and we right our regular monthly checks we printed you know um and i hated i did it for three years and hated every minute of it and still founded about half of our checks um-hum huh maybe a third i still hand wrote because it would be like in the school parking lot or hm yep you know at my child's skating lesson or something like that so we had to come we had two checks two sizes of checks right um excuse me Beth right there my daughter wants to know where the spaghetti cheese is um so we we tried and it was pretty nice one of one mistake i think we made in that is that um for budgeting purposes in terms of putting it in a budget we must have had eighty different categories and so they they became sort of nonsensical instead of i always said if we had redone it we should have just put big categories like utilities yep um-hum right and you know luxuries and entertainment that sort of thing we have about twenty five categories is all probably and we write all of our checks out of the register we don't try to do any through the computer and then my wife just sets down when she's got about an hour and just keys them all in and it's really not you know that bad it um well i don't know it might it might've been tough for you but she enjoys it and that's another thing too she really enjoys it she uh uh well i see i suppose that's the key um just gets a thrill out of seeing where her money went i guess do you does your wife work outside the home she does she's she teaches at um a small two year college here she's uh teaches uh business communications oh my goodness well with a CPA and a business person you should be organized and uh yeah uh i don't know no we still have problems with money like everybody else yeah  afternoon Doug it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you uh-huh and i'm uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you normally i talk to people in Plano Texas yeah me too how did you get on this list uh through Nancy Dalgren she um she had somehow gotten the information from TI and was distributing it around oh okay all righty well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy do what ideas do you have on that Doug um see i'm not sure that i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um people to invade your privacy when they want to i think it's um in what in what manner well it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone it's completely trivial to for instance listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone since they're just radio signals it's um um-hum and let's see well what's the first thing that comes to your mind well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something uh-huh and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh additional knowledge to me that's an invasion of privacy yeah i agree with you there for sure um and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know it's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company uh-huh it's you know possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that well um well yes well for instance yes um and they'll probably goes into other things like you know your records with the government or utility companies or anything do you consider these serious uh problems since um uh not not yet anyways because i don't think they're widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems um-hum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it um i'm not really sure because the i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so and it's hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not and i'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't um uh why do you see any out for us well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely private private and and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies uh-huh i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies uh-huh in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then you'd uh-huh you'd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them yeah i suppose but but we have no control of that now and then uh you you're when you're talking with them you really don't want to tell them everything that's on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you uh-huh  i'm Bridget hi hi i'm Joan this is a riot i i'm making money what are you doing oh bull is this Mrs Slaubacher what are you doing the same thing okay hold on push your one and let's get with it okay okay so what do you think about raising kids you don't know anything about this well i don't have kids so it's kind of hard to say it is kind of hard for you but i think that i mean i think it's kind of sad that like they're talking about like what the trends are today i think it's kind of sad that people are so uh um-hum involved with their careers and stuff that they don't take time for their kids i think it's really sad i think they should reevaluate their priorities i do to that's true because i was waiting to get someone that would say yeah well you know it's hard to spend time with my kids and i was just gonna be like gritting my teeth hoping not to say something i didn't mean to right right but i i think you need to take that for the little bit of time it takes like for or about but i think it's really sad ten years out of your life of really being around them when they really need you and their younger ages it's worth that ten years and it pays off i think yeah see see i do too i agree because the ten years isn't long till you can work on your career and then you have forty years more to do your career no i know if you don't if you wanna have a career that's fine but i don't think you should have kids you know or wait till you're yeah that's true ready to give up some of it that's true what well you know some of the um i see it with our teachers that have waited for it till they're thirty four thirty five uh-huh really and they have that first one and boy you'd think they were the only ones that ever had kids really they and yeah they really love it that's great i think they're kind of sorry then they didn't that they waited that long because they really enjoy them a lot that they waited see i know and i see that a lot with the young girls that think that's all they wanted was careers and then when they hit around thirty four thirty five they decide well the really want to try motherhood uh-huh yeah and uh that happens but i agree if they if they want a career though i think they should go with the career and forget the kids when and see i see too i mean i it sounds bad and i know people would totally disagree and say it shouldn't have to be a choice but for the welfare of the kid i think it is yeah yeah right right are you at school now are you that's a riot yes or at least it uh-huh yep i'm in Lubbock that's hilarious must have been right when you said something i knew that was you i was like oh my gosh um what are some of the things you think the parents should do with their kids God anything i mean take them to the park on Saturday or God i mean even if they say they don't have time for kids they should sit down and eat dinner with their kids that would take all of thirty minutes right yeah see i think that dinner time is real important with kids that's when a lot of things would come out yeah that if you and you'd make i know that when they're all going all different directions but i used to at least make three meals three meals out of a week they had to be together yeah and i kind of insist on it and they were pretty good about it they hated to miss it because they'd hear about the good time we had if they weren't around yeah i just think it's important yeah i do too because that's when i don't know why but kids start talking when you're when you're around a dinner table and all they start telling all the things yeah especially you had so many kids too though so you get to hear the whole scoop on everyone because everyone would know yeah yeah and uh but i think any any entertainment that you can do with them is fun though when when you know we always loved to go camping uh-huh and that's great even even now we go camping in fact we have one set up in May do you really and the grand kids come now it's the grand kids i mean we started out when the kids were young doing this and now they bring their babies um Mary's baby was four weeks old when we took her oh how cute we took him and uh we start them out real young even and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them on uh-huh really see that's great they and they love that outdoors i'd love to do that yeah and they go fishing from the time they're little and uh the daddies take them out in the boats it's fun see this is important i know i i get engaged and my mom's like so how long you think it'll till you have kids and i was like God i'm not married even yet uh yeah don't start saying kids i'm not ready yeah but i think any any outings with kids is wonderful makes you get to know them better and another thing i like is um just making sure you have time with each one alone yeah yeah that's of important yeah even you you know no matter how many you have you should take a special day a special time for one for each so they don't feel like there isn't singled out yeah and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch or just taking them to the park alone and you'd be surprised what they'll talk about when you're just sitting there on a swing talking see yeah just as long  so you uh exercise on a regular basis i don't Vinny i'm a a CPA and this time of year i'm dang busy but uh i do do a lot of exercise in the spring and summer and in the fall uh-huh what kind of exercise do you do well i don't i don't go to a health club and work out and things of that nature but i i run a lot um-hum i usually try to get uh oh about three mornings um-hum three mornings a week where i run two two miles a day oh that's not bad um-hum yeah how about yourself well i uh i like to run but uh i have problems with my back hurting so uh i run i if i run it's usually short durations and i only do it when i can't you know get out of the house um um-hum um-hum there you know to go because i usually work out in a health club and uh i try to work out like every other day and sometimes when it's like a really nice day outside i don't feel like going inside to work out then i go ahead and run for short duration yes um-hum um-hum uh do you uh pump iron or what kind of uh yeah i use i like to do uh free weights um-hum um-hum because uh i found certain parts of my body developed better than other parts of my body so uh instead of they you know they have like different circuits and they tell you to work every single muscle in your body and uh i hate working a muscle that you know just won't develop um-hum um-hum so uh i've i've gotten uh i've adapted to uh a routine and i like to work my arms and my chest and my stomach and everything else just seems to stay the same no matter what i do to it hum so those are what i like to work out the most and you know i get a pretty decent workout with my legs um just you know on occasion running but or you know just running around what i do everyday so uh what i i've never been around weights much is how how's a dead weight help you versus the machine type well sometimes what happens is sometimes uh now different machines i guess uh work different ways but uh the way i look at it if sometimes the machine like you know one hand can put more porce can put more force than the other one um-hum so sometimes you end up working out one hand more than the other or one leg more than the other because the machine averages the weights out oh yeah uh-huh because you're pulling like the same set of weights out now they they have different machines that will uh right uh-huh um equalize that or right they have what they have like a uh weight weight for one side and a weight for the other side and that's you know better than uh than like a universal set usually has like one set of weights that you know you do for both of them right um-hum um but even then uh i i'd like to think the free weights simulate a live a real world situation better um-hum you know like uh just like a friend of mine used to tell me he goes uh if you work out with free weights you know and a car falls on you think the free weights going to give you better uh better idea of what's going to happen rather than if you work out with uh you know with some kind of machine yeah uh-huh but uh the machines the one thing the machines do do that the free weights don't do is they focus on a specific muscle or muscle group huh-uh which is something i don't think you will get out of the free weights because the free weights just kind of work your whole body i guess or a whole area as opposed to like one spot because if you get like a particular Nautilus machine or something um-hum yes yeah you can get it like down to you know the very last muscle down there hum so it works pretty good what do you uh do you work your cardiovascular system at all other than the running how do you you know get your um that heart rate up for a while i'm sorry say that one more time i was just wondering how you get your heart rate up or does pumping iron do that oh no usually what i do is when i get to the uh i i usually like run around the track they have a track there um-hum okay i run around the track uh you know uh maybe like it's a tenth of a mile all the way around so i just run real slow you know maybe do a couple of laps just enough to get my heart rate going um-hum and uh after that then i just go ahead and just get in my routine i do uh i do my um my sit ups first and that also uh that gets my heart rate going too and then i i don't pump iron until maybe like halfway through and then i sit down and start doing the the free weights um-hum and then i usually run before i leave to kind of relax me a little bit that's incredible yeah so it it works out okay i haven't uh i the problem is you know i get into it and i work out for three months four months in a row get in great shape and then you know i'll have a business conference i usually go overseas twice or three times a year um-hum yes and to attend these conferences and they kill me you you travel you eat a lot you um it messes up you know your uh biological clock you know huh yeah and uh it just screws you up completely and by the time you come back you don't feel like working out you know huh do do do do your muscles uh do do you lose the tone fast do you lose the strength in them fairly quickly or well uh i you you don't lose strength i don't think you lose a little bit of tone uh-huh um but you get back into it and you know it doesn't take very long to build it back up but uh i don't think you know they say you get flabby if you you know the more you work out and you get all big muscles and stuff and then also when you stop they say you get flabby when you get older you know um-hum um-hum well it may happen but like i said it's easy to develop them because if i lose if i lose tone you know by not working out uh over a period of a week or two  well Wendy have you had any uh experiences with your nieces in school to indicate that something's wrong with the school system well they they don't seem to discipline the children like they used to uh-huh now when i was in school i'm i'm only twenty nine and i i hadn't been out of college that long but when we were in grade school we you know if you got in trouble you definitely got paddled or you know something something was done and now they can't touch the children yeah do you think that's the fault of the school system or society or well it's really a combination the fact that so many parents refuse to let the school discipline their children and the fact that they let yeah parents or or people file law suits for one thing i have a friend that is a teacher in Houston yes and she says the kids can hit you kick you stab you and you can not touch them and if you touch them then they can sue you and they can sue sue the school system yeah so it's really no more a failure of society i i think so i think so and and i you couldn't pay me enough to be a teacher in a bad in a bad city no and and and our town where you know maybe thirty thousand people there's not a problem i have a friend who's a principal of a Dallas school the stories she tells oh yes oh really yeah it's unbelievable the things and and of course the sweet little kids within well the neighborhood that she's in is is very economically deprived and that is reflected in the students abilities i mean they have no support at home um-hum so for if you casually looked at it you could say maybe the test scores in that school are bad and and therefore there's a failure of the public school system but when the parents are not interested or don't have the resources or can't even read themselves um-hum that sort of thing it it's bound to affect the education of the children well yeah and the fact that they're not putting enough money into the schools oh well you know and they don't even have adequate facilities is i just wonder where all the money goes i mean my well isn't isn't that the truth my taxes are exorbitant and i i i don't think you solve problems too much by throwing money at it i think you have to get the parents interested and have to get the community support and that sort of thing um-hum um-hum and and let the school give them a little more you're right give them a little more support and a little more to work with and as these kids you know as the kids get older it's it's even harder yeah because then you know their minds are made up as to what they're gonna do by then oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is well yes and if you don't develop an interest in reading at an early age it gets awfully hard a lot later on oh yeah yeah they see no point you know we've gotten away with it this far that's right but again society's uh influences i think can affect how well the students perform more than this than what the public school is or is not doing yeah oh yeah i mean certainly drugs and and peer pressures of that sort can again make the students fail and therefore look like that there's something something deficient about the public school system yeah and it just frightens me when i think about having a child and sending them to school where they're they're selling drugs in in grade school isn't that scary i can't imagine i mean we wouldn't even have known what they were talking about let alone take something or you know sell it buy it i i just can't imagine that it has has come so far that there's little kids dealing drugs and older kids dealing to the little kids and that's right but then then again that's something that that's very difficult for the schools to try to control yeah this principal i know does the best she can in terms of dealing with students this is a grade school students who are members of gangs oh my goodness yes students who carry weapons to school um and when we were little when we went to grade school we lived in Waxahachie and little bitty town you know little bitty school and there was i i i just it is beyond my comprehension to imagine grade schoolers with weapons and and gangs oh yeah and it's just you might as well just have a police file on them that's right you know because you you know you you learn who the leaders are and you know what they're doing and it's you can't do anything to them that's right but when there are disruptive influences like that in the school i think it makes it especially difficult for the children who want to learn it really does because even even the ones that are that want to will let the other ones bully them out of it  okay um what type of magazines do you have we take several at home i i take um Skiing Magazine and i take uh Discover Magazine and also uh CD and Stereo Review uh-huh and National Geographic i think oh that's a and Boys Life oh good that's a good one i'd like to get um so i take it that you like to ski do you um do you um receive a lot of information on skiing through the Skiing Magazine i presume that i do uh i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth because i do get things from ski associations and things uh-huh oh uh at during the year oh uh and do you receive discounts and things like that do you think or uh not so much that i uh more likely to see those at a ski show or something but um i just enjoy reading about the resorts and oh where you can go and and new equipment that's come out and so forth some fashions are always in there too oh um-hum so with this vacation you're taking did you receive the information from your skiing magazine probably not uh we already knew we wanted to take one and we just started looking around oh i may have referred to a couple of them but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information and picked up a lot of brochures oh hm and just decided to go to Crested Butte we hadn't been there before um that sounds nice it's kind of away from the crowd that's why we chose that one it's supposedly low lift lines but i haven't skied Utah yet but i want to uh-huh oh huh that's oh well you need to come out like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those i understand Deer Valley is nice too uh-huh Deer Valley uh-huh yeah they are it's wonderful snow well how about you what what magazines do you have at home uh i am currently taking Decorative Woodworking and uh Country Living and let's see we do have National Geographic and then we have some church magazines but i really enjoy the Decorative Woodworking i'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that so the Decorative Woodworking has just been a great great help oh okay does it have uh articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth um-hum uh-huh they do have uh mostly they have the the ads on the equipment but the whole magazine is just filled with uh pictures and projects that you can make yourself and then it has all of the patterns and the instructions that you would need to make a wood project and and then how to paint it with the tole paintings and so it's really a fun one i like that well that's good it's good to get use out of one uh-huh i'm not sure that um in the case of National Geographic i mean i read it but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time but then eventually there'll be a school project or something um-hum where my son will need to refer back through forty eight back issues to find you know France or something or whatever it is he's looking for uh-huh yeah yes i've i've noticed that too but they have been nice to have around every once in a while they come in handy i used to take Smithsonian too and i liked that magazine but it was i was just found myself not ever getting around to reading it you get so many coming in and hm oh uh-huh oh by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading the first round oh that uh because oh Scientific American comes to our house too i forgot that's mostly my son's but he but i do read it too and so oh uh-huh hm well that sounds and he takes Games Magazines too Games Magazine which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve uh-huh oh you know crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that and he likes to to try that and so um-hum he does but does get to be a lot of paper though after a while if you don't keep them weeded out they almost take over uh-huh they do they can do that i found that they've been fun for my little girls they're five and four years old and they like to go through and oh yeah they're just kind of getting started now with there uh-huh they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on and so we've found good use for those mine is a senior in high school so he's we're kind of at the end of that trail you're just sort of beginning to think about first grade oh oh uh-huh yeah it's fun well i do have a boy in junior high too so oh okay so you've got a little bit of a gap there between the little ones so we're kind of running the gamut yeah but they do it  hi i'm Bridget i'm Barbara it's nice to meet you well it's nice to meet you where are you from i'm in Lubbock oh i'm in Garland are you uh-huh okay good you ready for me to push one then okay yes i am so what kind of clothes do you wear to work i wear dresses skirts um that type of attire i'm a secretary uh-huh are you uh-huh okay well this is kind of a hard topic because i don't work you don't no i'm in college so oh so you can dress carefree right but i think that's right i have on a sweat shirt right now and and jeans and i feel great what is your best mode of clothing pardon what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best yeah but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure yes that's what i wear mainly is suits cotton or um gabardine um-hum wool sometimes in winter but here in Texas you don't really need wool that often yeah doesn't get that hot yes i don't know i can't i would i wouldn't like to have to wear a suit every day though i wouldn't like that at all no i don't do it every day yeah just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others um with dress clothes uh-huh i honestly i don't know because i haven't had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know uh-huh i really don't think i i don't even i couldn't even tell you but i would say i don't know well i like cotton the best it's easier to take care of and it's it's uh a much fresher freer and freer fabric yeah that's true anything you don't have to iron that you can just send to the cleaners sounds great well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but there's some fabrics like you said that uh gabardines and suedes and that that have to go to the cleaners all the time really do you wear really dressy dresses to work yes yes yes i'm up in corporate do you oh okay so you go all out and everything yes yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to yes because the first person they see is the secretary before the boss and uh i couldn't uh get away with blue jeans and a T-shirt uh-huh i bet you couldn't do you wear sneakers do you wear um brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores um i usually get like i usually get Nike um-hum with shoes and stuff like that i'm real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes i see do you like sweaters uh-huh yeah i love sweaters do you wear them often yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the turtle neck sweater jacket thing a lot um so i mean i would say mostly like now it's like you could wear like a T-shirt or sweat shirt because it's usually chilly in the morning but it's it's warmer at night um-hum but in the winter you have to bundle up because it gets really cold it's a lot different because i i'm from Dallas oh are you yeah i think it's a lot colder than it does in Dallas that's for sure with all the snow and everything that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before yeah because i because i am from Dallas and i live in Richardson so uh-huh i mean it gets cold there but it's not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets cold and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at twenty miles an hour and it gets like bitter cold um-hum and you have to walk across campus and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything are you into hats uh-huh yeah do you wear hats and for dress up too or just in winter um hum i have like one and i wear it when i dress up but otherwise i don't have that many though i don't think about it i'm not real good at picking out clothes like if someone were to buy me an outfit and put out with it i would wear it all the time but as far as me picking out clothes myself oh it's not very good um-hum hum in your new uh career after college you going to need clothes a lot yeah i probably will go to graduate school because i want to be a marriage counselor uh-huh but i'll still need nice clothes you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then i'll still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that um-hum that's what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work to the do you like clothes for uh different seasons or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it um  okay Bill um as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now who do you work with this time well i own a company you own the company alright i'm the president and CEO of the company my goodness so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are yeah i guess you do hum but uh you so what are you asking me what what benefits i think are most important well what what do you think of the let's put it this way what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary um i'd say in today's economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan um-hum i'd say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan a profit sharing plan that's interesting um-hum they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're part like you know because they feel like well we're contributing to it so we'd like to participate in it and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working yes because they they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job right i think most people uh don't want money um it's been my experience most people want uh to feel like they're participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they can enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of um-hum and it's a contribution right well Bill uh that idea fits me exactly i just retired from uh the university here and that's been the goal of my life was to contribute and um to the work that i was doing in my research and that's what made me happy and uh that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for and i'm sure a lot of them don't you can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction um we're a financial planning firm you're a financial planning firm how many uh uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh uh-huh uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to retire um-hum oh and uh it's real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh um that it take care of them they don't none of them really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable well what what changes would you have have you considered uh in in doing it to your to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the result when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars oh okay um-hum even though they didn't bring it in they help it once it's there right well see we have different we have marketing people and then we have uh financial planners yeah and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know that if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly um-hum and so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business and uh yes but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the locality locality there those people want that kind of support well and and and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that they're the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with um-hum um-hum uh it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it um-hum see we don't want anybody around here that says make me do it i don't think anybody any i think most people want to be yeah lack a better terminology terminology they want to be self employed but they don't want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please that's true without some real strict adherence which that's what we have um-hum  have you recently bought a car Eric or well well i didn't buy one i just changed jobs changed jobs and got a work car or a company car and uh they bought me a Pontiac Grand Prix and uh-huh i've been yeah i've been pretty happy with it i i've been driving just a little little Honda the Honda Civic and stuff so it's a bigger car but i've been pretty pleased with it you know i uh that's a nice car isn't it um-hum it was it's you know got a lot of nice gadgets and stuff but i gosh it's been nice so far i can't say that it's put it through all the loops can you use it for personal too to yeah i can use it for personal and so so you buying a car to you right at this point anyway isn't a a big deal no not really i although we my other we have a second car and it's getting a little bit old it's an eighty five Honda Civic and so we're thinking in a year or two we might have to but uh uh-huh you know i i kind of i just like to keep up i you know don't uh don't plan on buying one like i say for a year or two but sooner or later i'm going to have to yeah but we we just bought two years ago we just bought a a Plymouth Voyager uh-huh and it's been great we've got family a a family of five three kids and that's the only way to travel as far as i'm concerned the uh-huh oh i bet the kids can get up and move around and you can get them things now is that a is that a full size van or it it's not it's a it's a minivan minivan uh and it was the best rating out of the consumer reports and things oh was it it you do so do you shop the consumer reports when you buy a car then or do you i do i do and do you find that works out pretty good for you yeah we've only bought two new cars i bought a Nissan Sentra uh-huh that um and i really liked it too didn't have any problems with it did you uh-huh and this one has been been an exceptional vehicle we've really enjoyed it especially for kids well that's good to hear yeah that's good to hear some good news about some American made cars i uh-huh i uh i really believe they're getting better and you know i i i looked around and seen some of those new Saturns and stuff and they seem to be a really nice car yes and well actually my philosophy about i mean if i was going to buy something for me like a car i'd drive around unfortunately i'd still get a foreign car i think that Honda makes uh like you've got the Accords are very very well built i also really like the Toyota Camrys yeah uh-huh uh-huh but they're just not practical if you have kids yeah that's true you can't um well if they get older i guess you can take four or five people but when they're small you got to get up and crawl over the seat and you know which doesn't work um-hum oh yeah what we found just even going down to our inlaws overnight uh uh this little Honda Civic there's just not enough room we i've just got one daughter by the time you put the car seat and a couple of bags i mean we're just uh-huh you know we we uh we were having that problem that why there's just not enough room those small cars any more we couldn't go camping because we couldn't put a tent and a cooler in it you know it was so small yep yeah but uh and uh Chrysler's started doing some nice things with their with their warranties and things i've got a seven year seventy thousand mile warranty on the drive train oh really yeah and a three year thirty six six thousand mile on uh i think it's a pretty that's pretty well bumper to bumper oh really but the drive train is seven seventy and that's i think that's one of the well i kind of think that the other manufacturers are now uh bumping it up to meet it but Chrysler was the first to do that yeah that's yeah they've had that for a while yeah well it says something they're willing at least put something behind it you know they're they feel like turning out a good product and they're at least yeah yeah that warranty stuff that's uh i did have to take this company car in and the cassette jammed all of a sudden and it was nice to know that you know that warranty it was still under its warranty and they just took it and took care of it right on the spot but that's definitely something i think i'd shop for i'd want as much warranty as i could because yep it's expensive to get the things fixed anymore yeah if it's not covered and i'm thinking about getting a used car with my next one trying to see if i can't take some of the depreciation off i don't know they're still danger expensive you know i'd you know only i only want to buy something like maybe twenty thousand miles on it they they don't go down much you know unless they're a couple years old or something to buy it yeah uh-huh no they don't you know they yeah if you get something that's one or two years old uh you can usually knock i i worked at a bank as a loan officer and so i could you know i got into that a little bit you know the dealership financing and stuff but um-hum you know at two years makes a huge difference you know they say and it's pretty much true that you drive off the lot and you lose at least a thousand dollars as soon as you take that thing off the lot in value and the Hondas and some of those they don't depreciate as much but you can still get them a little bit cheaper yeah yeah but i tell you what it's kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them yes you're kidding me i couldn't believe it i uh we stickered the car i got this Grand Prix was stickered at uh sixteen thousand it was a ninety one and had uh had ten thousand miles on it but we ended up getting it for about ten and i mean they bought it for ten they'll sell it for sixteen seventeen thousand i could not believe it had just if you know somebody that's the way to go but unfortunately only the dealers can get in but uh hum yeah huh i tell you i i've been real happy with the Hondas actually we had a have a nineteen eighty Honda Accord too  okay um have you ever had to put one a a family member in a nursing home no but we're getting pretty close to it my wife's uh uh stepfather uh is in the hospital right now and hopefully we can pull him out uh back home but we don't know yet oh uh-huh oh how about yourself well my mom is sixty five and she's which i feel is you know quite young still but she's not in the greatest of health and uh-huh so recently she has been talking a lot about what we would do if we had to put her in a nursing home she's adamant that she does not want to live with any of her children uh-huh and put that burden on us yeah so so is uh so is our uh my my uh my mother's parents oh uh-huh my family my mother mother and daddy are dead uh-huh but their parents are still alive oh my goodness wow oh um-hum eighty four and eighty yeah see eighty four one eighty four year old man that's in the hospital uh-huh but uh we've been looking into it and uh course nursing homes i think uh you would find that uh you would want uh one close to home right and one that has a pleasant surrounding um-hum and one that has good staff that uh you know will take care of you and treat you you know like a a like an individual right and uh and look after your every needs i know down here in Texas we've had a lot of problems with nursing homes that uh that don't uh take care of their people um-hum oh they've gone in they've closed down a lot of them and they put new regulations on some of them you go in you find an old person with a bed sore because they haven't been turned or haven't been cleaned oh oh dear so uh all of that uh you know i think someone needs to know uh about uh the qualifications of a nursing home um-hum and the staff now how do you go about finding out things like that you well let's assume that uh you wanted to take your mother to a uh nursing home there locally in Ogden i'm sure you've got some that's close by uh-huh it would it what would be real nice is find one around the corner that you could visit that you could go in and uh talk to the people talk to some of the people's uh uh siblings right um-hum oh that's right or uh you know children children and uh find out how they like it you know course one of the most important things is is uh can you afford it uh-huh well that's true and uh down in some small cities here in Texas it's about fifteen hundred dollars a month over here in Dallas it's closer to three thousand if you really wanna get super care you know you can pay anything you want to that's right oh my course we haven't even mentioned Medicaid uh which and uh which uh would take care of an individual who is destitute boy well um-hum uh-huh and course there's a lot to be said about uh making a member destitute oh well as opposed to uh paying for it yourself because the government you know uh provides for a destitute person um-hum well that's what my mom's been saying you know she's been just saving her money and not paying a penny of it but she says my little bit of savings will probably pay for a nursing home for maybe a year and then i'll be on Medicaid anyway so she said yeah why don't i go out and and enjoy life while i can and you know when i get to that point of being in a nursing home then maybe Medicaid will just have to take care of me but why don't i just enjoy life now yeah well yeah and that's true because uh after the year's gone all of her savings are going to be eaten up and if she owns her house uh i'm not sure about the total rules on the house but i assume that you'd have to sell the house and those proceeds would go to pay for the nursing home i think so yes and anyway it's while it's unlawful um there's nothing wrong with a parent gifting everything she has to uh to uh to an individual like uh like like you uh-huh uh-huh and then uh from there on out uh saving that money uh so that uh you could supplement her income after she goes under Medicaid oh a lot of people do that oh and most one of the most important things uh about sending a person to uh the nursing home is is the burial provided for uh-huh see that should be provided for before she ever goes out of her monies or otherwise you know the the uh the uh the kids have to provide that that's right uh-huh so uh you know i sure you've thought of all this yeah well it's it's kind of a sad thing to think about isn't it oh yes it's very sad we had a discussion with her mother who is uh is eighty years old this past weekend and uh yeah hm  favorite type of music or musician or any i don't really have a favorite type i like uh a lot of different types of music do you yeah i have a a tape collection that i like to listen to uh cassette tapes but it's pretty varied yeah how about you uh-huh uh-huh oh i i'm very uh i'm very varied as well i uh i don't think i've ever met a type of music i don't like except for uh maybe you know heavy metal and that that's exactly me the acid rock or the heavy metal even some of that i like okay but not mostly as a general rule i don't care for that at all yeah yeah yeah i don't enjoy rap too much either that that doesn't appeal to uh uh my ears well as far as the rap goes i think there are a few artists that appeal to me uh-huh themselves and i like some of their songs but as as i agree as a general rule i i wouldn't choose rap either huh oh um-hum but i i like to listen to uh what you might call pop easy listening country western jazz uh classical um i i like um-hum um-hum i like uh like i said pretty varied uh music i have a couple that my husband really hates when i listen to them uh-huh oh like uh Billy Holiday i really love to listen to her and uh i even have a a tape of Lady Smith Blackman Bazo uh-huh oh gosh and well i mean they're very harmonic they really are uh-huh uh-huh yeah sure so they're interesting to listen to you might try that how about you uh well um i i listen to uh specific most most most likely i would be listen to uh jazz or classical music um i in college i took uh a four years of classical guitar and i played in the in the jazz combo all four years i played guitar for the jazz combo so uh that's where my two oh yeah my two listening enjoyments are but but you know jazz can get on my nerves after a while uh you can't just listen to it you know to uh especially a lot of the deeper stuff you just can't listen to it for enjoyment unless you're it it's too um uh you have to concentrate on it it seems yeah unless unless you're playing it just it just doesn't do anything what about the blues or something like that uh uh blues are okay i i tell you i do like um i grew up on blue grass music my dad is a big blue grass fan and so um uh-huh i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school but i i i really do like it a lot so i i i like some of it um as far as like the country what they now call country western it doesn't sound like the old country music at all does it um some of it sounds more like pop music no it doesn't it doesn't yeah uh they've all got you know the real screechy electric guitars now and oh nah i don't care for that if if i'm gonna listen to today's country western i have tapes of like Randy Travis and Clint Black and i even liked Jim Reeves you know and yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah i i grew yeah i grew up on him or uh what what Meryl Haggard and Faron Young that type of country western music is what what i like to listen to Asleep At The Wheel uh-huh uh-huh sure uh-huh uh Sons of the Pioneers you know stuff like that uh-huh yeah um and i like sound tracks a lot yeah it it seems like you get a lot of original music that way oh do you yeah you sure do i mean you know think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that that's just real recent um-hum um-hum yeah uh things like that i like to listen to um i like instrumental things um-hum um i have some Spiro Gyro tapes oh they're great aren't they oh they're wonderful i love them i have some Dulcimer music i mean like i said that that's pretty varied yeah yeah it sure is yeah uh Al Jarreau he's somebody i like he's pretty kind of jazz inspired but but still kind of pop too uh-huh yeah i like his he has a nice smooth voice oh yeah and you know what i like the most about him is i've gone to see him in concert and he always he looks like he's having fun yeah sure i mean some people sing and they have their faces all contorted like it hurts them or something but he looks like he's having a good time i mean he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy and and like all he wants to do is is make the audience enjoy it too uh-huh sure and he he's real fun to listen to uh-huh um Bonnie Rait i like her a lot um in fact when ever she won her big Grammy i think there was like five of them or something was was it five or six um-hum um-hum uh-huh yeah something like that it was last last uh last year wasn't it yeah last year or the year before i can't remember but um i was listening to a particular radio station and and the one DJ said who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies and i vowed then that i was not gonna listen to that radio station any more if that DJ could make such an uneducated  children do you have uh just the one screamer okay How old how old i is uh he or she he's eighteen months today all right yeah year and a half and uh huh yeah and he's um he's discovered pens and that you lick the backs of stamps uh-huh that's what he was screaming about i just uh well i would suppose a lot of your time is spent with yours then yes i i'm a full time mother and i spend all day uh-huh yes and i spend all day with the baby uh-huh How how do you see most of the world now uh uh the country spending time with their children i see a real growing trend for families going back into the home where a lot a lot more people if they really can can make a a tight budget they're going back to where the women take care of the children at home and not working so much to and not working and not live live in the fancy homes and drive the nice cars yeah i think uh uh i personally see that happening maybe i'm not in the right neighborhood but uh-huh i really do see it a big trend toward that and people even not waiting as late in life as they had been i know for a while that there were people waiting to have their families and i think that trend is is slowing down uh-huh uh-huh i i'd have to agree with you that's what's happening back here in the west more people are are just saying it's not worth it and uh um-hum and spending more time at at home yeah i know it's tough for our family to do that i've got three kids um-hum and uh my oldest one is only six but she's still in dance and kindergarten and you know she's got a bunch of things going on and oh yeah and uh i my it's a good thing my wife she she does work a little bit she works part time uh-huh as a college instructor she at a junior college here but she has time to go to all of her uh dance concert recitals and things and and it just means so much and i i try to be there but i don't get to go all the time ah uh-huh yeah well i agree it it's really important to me to support my family to support my children and to support the children of my brother and sister too uh-huh uh-huh that i think children without support are really they're missing out a lot yeah my you know when when i was growing up my i i played high school sports uh-huh and my dad rarely missed a football game my mom mom and dad both but mostly my dad rarely missed a football game or a basketball game even if we had to travel away from the local area uh-huh he would always go and uh i remember that and i'll never forget that you know yeah oh and it well it obviously made a really good impression on you uh-huh so and that's something that i'd sure like to do with my kids when they yeah well i agree i'm i'm even considering putting my son at two in a tumbling class uh-huh and you know going and maybe staying with him during most of the class and then going to see what he does and all that because i really i think it's important for children to be around children but i also think it's important for there to be a tight nucleus at home uh-huh so i'm trying to think of what else what was the other part of the topic um trends and uh trends we've talked about trends um you're you're talking about your family does your do you find your husband has a hard time spending time with the child yeah yes it's tough isn't it i sure have a hard time see i still at work now well oh are you yes it's uh it is sure tough for me well he he has a tendency um to leave it to me since i'm with him all day uh-huh and it's really hard for me to let go too yep i feel very attached to my son and i i'm sure it would change if i had another one but um i just don't think that i don't know i i don't see much of a change happening there i wish they would spend more time together but yeah what line of business is he in we'll uh we'll see how that goes he's um a scientist with TI hum So he's part of the study here then almost isn't he well it's um it's not the speech study but it's a different kind of study i mean he he works uh-huh in uh laser he's a laser physicist uh-huh so it's a completely different line of work uh-huh than uh than the speech program but yep anyhow well i i'm an accountant and i know it takes it's it takes a lot of lot of time away from the home um-hum and so uh i just don't i the only time i get a lot of time with my kids is when  i'm Bridget hello my name's Dan it's nice to meet you are you ready for me to push one nice to meet you i think so okay okay do you have any kids uh no uh luckily i don't i just rent them you do yeah i'm a i'm an assistant scout master for a boy scout troop oh that's good yeah it's it's it's it's so much better to to rent a little easier yeah well what would you think if they were going off to college ooh that's uh let's see i i used to be able to do this quite well but that was when i was in college uh-huh yeah the college that i've got that that i went to was pretty good which was Cal Poly in Pomona uh-huh and uh you know it was a regular it was a state university and it seemed to be pretty good yeah because i'm in college right now i thought God this is a good question oh really which one i was like because i i know how my parents when i was looking at colleges um-hum they didn't really say anything i mean they didn't say you know i want you to go here or you know they left it up to me um-hum and uh i thought it was real interesting because i picked where i wanted to go and then afterwards my mom was like oh i really kind of wish you would have gone there and i didn't even know that she'd even you know liked another place or anything yeah uh but i don't think parents could make that decision for you well my my parents wanted me to go to uh community college uh-huh and uh i ended up getting into the university and they never really said anything about it until uh my sisters went to college and they they went to the community college uh-huh and my parents my father's going jeez it it it uh costs a lot more or just as much to go to community college and you aren't getting as much you know so yeah definitely because i know people i know some of my friends whose parents really wanted them to go somewhere so they did and they hate it you know um-hum oh yeah or that they don't do good and they fail out and it's like because i know one person yeah um his parents wanted him to go to SMU really bad um-hum and he went and he doesn't like it i mean he wouldn't admit to you that he doesn't like it but it you know he's not doing good and he never is excited about it or anything and he won't tell his parents i was like well why don't you transfer you know uh well because his parents gave him the car to go there well you know yeah i mean i really the car wouldn't get it because i just think that's sad i don't think parents can can make that decision for you i you know um-hum if you if they let i think you should choose and you know work something out between y'all God uh-huh that's that's the way colleges are right now anyway is they they have a bunch of kids come down they say hey you wanna be here yeah yeah oh i know it's it's so it's pointed towards you yeah see and if they sell you well enough there ain't nothing that's going to change your mind that's right that's right that's definitely true we're consumers in society yeah sad as long as i just think as long as people are happy so many people will go some place and transfer or whatever um-hum yeah it's like you got to find where you fit in best yeah you got to got to find the good classes and things like that yeah really i know i have some hard classes now that i'm just like uh i i well i can imagine that i i started off the the counselor at high school said oh you wanna do this well then go into aerospace aerospace stuff like that uh-huh i went and my first day of enrollment in college i walked around i go into the aerospace building they give me the curriculum and it's like twenty one units to twenty four units a quarter uh and you're like uh i don't think i want to do that yeah and average is like you know it's supposed to be like sixteen eighteen you know yeah you know this is like i don't want to be a doctor yeah you're like i i really didn't want to do it i was just kidding you know i just thought i'd come try it out yeah yeah i happened to be walking down the hall turned into some some other instructor's office and said help me and he sold me on his program yeah really yeah you can't have someone can't choose that for you that's why i think people people i know that stay in school so long it's because they can't figure out what they wanna do yeah yeah like what you know and they start with one major and they go through the certain you know classes you have to take for that major then they change their mind yeah and it's like oh you got to start all over because you lose all the classes you just took that's crazy that's like um-hum they need to hire someone to help you and everyone should have to take like a test or something of what you might want to do because i think that's so sad because people yeah well they there there's some tests like that now but they're kind of strange some of them you know it's like you you you should be a cement mixer or something like that you know yeah there are yeah yeah i know yeah i know they have better ones yeah you know and the guy walked in going yeah but i wanted to be a psychologist yeah you're going you should be a farmer you're like a farmer what yeah i know we took those in like high school those are stupid yeah they ought to tell you mine is psychology what's what's your major  hi i'm Susan Linnstaedter where you calling from uh i'm in Dallas okay all right so am i okay you understand the topic uh yeah um-hum okay i'm going to go hit the button so what do you think about the death penalty uh well i've mixed feelings i guess you'd say it's it's not something that uh i mean uh you know it doesn't make me happy um-hum but uh on the other hand you know the present alternatives at least in Texas are not real good i mean it's an all or nothing proposition you know you either you either uh give somebody a death penalty or um-hum um-hum they're out on the streets in a very short time to uh have have a repeat performance of whatever they did um um-hum and i guess uh you know i guess i should mention i'm an attorney and i used to do some criminal work and um oh hum as long as it's reserved for special purposes and as long as as uh you know the judicial process that's afforded to someone pretty much for psychopathic killers and stuff you know makes you feel good about that you've got the right guy then i guess i i can live with it yeah um-hum well what'd you think about Jeffrey Dahmer now uh i haven't been keeping up with that i've been in and out of of town and i haven't kept up with it what's happening to him well well he got fifteen life sentences um-hum uh so they went ahead and ruled him uh at least legally sane to stand trial for uh sane right um-hum okay well okay so i see he can get up to fifteen life sentences and uh i he with no chance for parole but uh see we don't have that in Texas that's the problem hum is is you can't give somebody life without parole at least at this point uh-huh well huh that's not very good no i mean you know uh a life sentence they get time and a half for um time served and uh if they get made a trustee they get good time um which is like two two days for every day they serve uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh hum and they can really be out or eligible for parole in a fairly short space of time now what's uh what is a life term if someone gets a life term what's the earliest they can get out i want to say uh you know they've changed things since i used to since i used to practice that kind of work but i think that uh-huh somebody told me that within ten or twelve years they would be um eligible for parole wow i mean it's not very long um-hum well now i know in uh in Virginia i i think it's about the same i want to say each life term you're eligible for parole within fifteen years um-hum and uh i knew um well see also in Texas it's real unusual for them to do what they call stack them stack the penalties uh-huh uh-huh oh they they will they will cause the penalties to run concurrently oh okay yeah see they should make consecutively i don't like this concurrent stuff yeah i mean on on something like a like a Jeffrey Dahlmer or somebody like that you know that definitely i mean you know why go through the farce of having a parole hearing right right you know what's going to happen if you let him out i mean we and in Texas too i mean i smaller states like Vermont uh and places like that have some real innovative um-hum rehabilitation type activities that they can do in their penal system and in a in a state like Texas we don't have that right hum they get down there we are warehousing people basically yeah and they go down there and they maybe pick up a few tricks you know how to be worse and uh and then you turn them loose on society and i just don't think that that's i don't think that's right i don't think that's fair um-hum see that's what what i don't like is warehousing you know i mean if you make them useful you know put them in jail and make them do something you know yeah uh i don't know make license plates you know something yeah i mean it to me uh for me to pay i mean what does it cost uh per year to uh to keep uh an inmate i think they said it's something like eighteen thousand dollars per per person is is what we were paying per inmate that's a lot of money uh it's a lot yeah you know i mean some people don't even make that much money a year you know huh-uh and i think that's free well and and if you consider the fact that with with all the the federal lawsuits that went on and all the standards that there are for how you can and cannot treat prisoners and and what they're entitled to have uh-huh uh-huh um-hum frankly you know it's it's considered cruel and inhumane for a prisoner at the state penitentiary to live in conditions that would look pretty attractive to some of the homeless people who have not committed a crime yeah yeah you know i mean we just our system is is is kind of skewed somehow or another yeah and like i say i mean you know i can't i can't tell you i feel good about the fact that we put people to death uh-huh uh-huh i mean i really uh you know deep down i guess that bothers well  well the topic is is very apropos to what's going on um how do you feel about our topic well i feel like uh i do feel like we pay a lot of taxes i don't mind paying a lot of taxes if the taxes taxes are spent well yes but uh i'm not convinced that they're being spent well um um i think that's because uh it's like i told someone the other day i'm a housewife and uh among uh working mother too and i know how it is to live on a budget and i hear what you're saying um-hum um-hum um-hum you know our taxes it's nice to see them spent for things that benefit the community but when we see them wasted that's when we think we're paying too much well i feel i i mean one of the things is when it's it it's not going it's going into a lot of military stuff which is badly spent um-hum and not going into a lot of infrastructure things uh or or um you know social needs um that that it could i mean when you look at the pie it's uh where our money is spent it's it's uh very very um skewed yeah and uh so i don't feel like i i just don't feel like they're doing what i would do with it well i think uh in a way that's that's uh almost off our topic in you know in that uh they didn't want us to talk about how it was spent but i don't think you can separate it i know um i felt very fortunate once when i talked with a lady from England and she said their taxes are at least fifty percent uh-huh and uh in talking to people i've met from other places uh we do seem to get off light except you know if you ever make money one year now you pay all this horrible taxes and you don't get to keep any of it well uh but the people who pay a lot of taxes also get a lot of services they have national health that's so you know uh oh yeah um-hum in other words yes that's why i say in the other countries yeah so i'm saying if we did i wouldn't mind paying what we pay um-hum or even more if i got a lot of stuff back for it yeah but uh well on national health so many of them can't use it they say because they never can get in to see their doctors yeah at least in England i we hear that here uh some although we get some people who obviously don't want it like um-hum yeah um-hum like rich doctors yeah who who'd rather us not have it i think but i don't know i i just and local taxes um i think are probably just about the same you know the school the school taxes and all of that income of course is not a a topic in in Texas yet but i'm sure it's coming um-hum i hope it doesn't i uh i hope not but i don't see any way out of it unless we start cutting some spending drastically yeah no that's true i've lived in uh states where they had income tax and you you know and you just get used to it yeah but uh again again um it just depends on what they're what it's being spent on of course i i think the sales tax is about the most equitable tax there is because if you don't uh buy and participate you don't have to have to pay it um and uh that way people who use the facilities and live outside of the area basically help pay some of the upkeep for it yeah and sometimes and sometimes i think it does work that way um um-hum but they you know uh uh again it's it's you you you have the different kind of taxes then then then what are they being used for and who is deciding what they are being used for and how much is spent to administrate administrate them right yeah all those people are doing those things and and and i know that the stories i mean i personally know people who have been in this place where you know they they're having trouble paying their taxes and they um-hum uh like you would with a bank you know go into the IRS and say you know you can you can do all this stuff to me and get nothing or give me you know let me pay this out and you'll get it all um-hum um-hum and they'll say no you know and i think now wait a minute that was my money you said no with well well well you're not going to get it all uh yeah that's right yeah and and one of the things that makes it so hard on these people they slap so much penalty and interest on it um-hum that they can triple it in nothing flat yeah i mean it's the one place that there's no recourse at all um-hum and a lot of people aren't trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back right and they just they don't accept that at all so um-hum  okay what do do you do artistic painting um i do tole painting oh you do uh-huh i really love the tole painting um i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor i would like to learn that some day but right now my passion is tole painting uh-huh do you do a lot of it yeah i i took one class about i guess three or four years ago and i've done a little um but it takes a lot of time oh it does it is real time consuming and do do you sell your projects uh mostly i have just given them away as gifts um uh-huh i've done uh perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and oh on and on you know just things like that but um-hum um i would eventually like to make enough to sell and quit my job where do you work at i just work at Stop and Shop out there in in Ogden so oh now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique no i've wanted to do that uh but just haven't just haven't mass produced enough to do that uh-huh so i have five children of my own so it's that keeps you busy they they keep me busy and tole painting's just a you know something i do in my spare time so uh-huh have you tried any of the well do you cut out your own projects yes uh-huh i have my own saws and so i really enjoy doing that huh do you um ever spray your projects with uh i mean a base coat first or do you brush it all on i brush it on yeah i haven't tried a a spray varnish i use just a wood sealer uh-huh and i just bought a spray gun one of those airless um not airless high volume low pressure spray guns oh uh-huh and i do a lot of wood working and that's what i bought it for do you oh but i haven't used it yet oh well that's that probably give you a smoother finish wouldn't it oh now what type of wood working do you do yeah yeah um fine uh furniture type stuff yeah oh do you that's why i brought bought the sprayer is to finish my projects that's my worst oh worst part of my wood working i get so sick of making it oh but it's hard to finish it huh yeah but spraying does put on a nicer finish oh well that is interesting so what kind of equipment do you have for wood working um let me see table saw scroll saw band saw lathe routers and that's about it uh-huh boy it sounds like you're really into it that is nice yeah it is yeah i i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router yeah the band saw's really nice i have an Inca i don't know if you've ever heard of those oh but yeah it's nice to have the right equipment yeah that is that makes it easier doesn't it well have you sold any of your furniture or um-hum just um not mostly i do like you do give it away as gifts uh-huh oh uh making my own furniture well oh well that's interesting do you uh did you take classes to learn how to do that um just in junior high and then i just kept on through high school and then bought my own equipment uh-huh kept up with that oh so yours is mostly just a hobby too then oh well that's interesting oh i would i really would love to go take a class in wood working and learn how to yeah yeah i don't know if i necessarily wanna do furniture but mostly uh just do more uh-huh the wood working like the shelves and for your tole painting uh yeah yeah so it's fun good well i guess i'll let you go now well they come on we're supposed to talk until they come on and tell us yeah well it's it has been really fun i've enjoyed this um oh they do oh okay so this is my first one you're probably a veteran at this like i say i've made a couple of calls to Texas and just talked to all different kinds of people so i think you'll enjoy doing it it's fun uh-huh yeah sounds fun where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here um you know there's a shop in Roy that i really love um and it's there by the Copper Mill restaurant used to be the Hayloft oh i'm not familiar well we live in Roy but we haven't is it on nineteen hundred uh-huh um let's see i'm trying to think of the name i know where fifty six hundred south is uh i don't not right off is that Ben Franklin then Ben Franklin okay  what kind of camping do you do down there well we have gone to several places um-hum um there's a real nice area north of here close to the Oklahoma border do you do you have a camp trailer or do you just take tents and sleeping bags um-hum no we take tents tents and sleeping bags is what we use take the whole family yeah we do uh we haven't gone in a while because we have a three year old and we're waiting for her to get a little bit older but we have two older kids and we take them um-hum and uh it's fun i mean we're not avid campers um-hum but um i guess our the funnest camping trip we had was was when we went up north close to the Oklahoma border that's north to me um um-hum and we stayed for about three or four days and the weather was very nice that's one thing you have to consider down here because in the summer it gets so hot um-hum that you know nobody wants to do anything um oh uh one time we went to Arkansas and did some camping um-hum um-hum i'd almost forgotten about that six years ago i guess do do you go up in the mountains or mainly stay in campgrounds well we didn't really have any just second what is it getting worse and worse okay um uh no we really didn't go up in the mountains you basically just go with the KOA campgrounds or something like that well this was a uh it wasn't a KOA what was Frazier what was that that we went to in Arkansas it was a park it was a state park um-hum yeah it was a state park um-hum um and they had trails you know that we could go on um-hum uh we were going to go on the river but the river was so high that year it'd been raining so much that they wouldn't let anybody get on the river huh i'll be yeah there were a lot of snakes around yeah oh it was Snake River oh Snake River with a lot of snakes in it uh-huh my experience at camping is a little bit different um we do we do do a little family camping but i do a lot of elk hunting with uh bow and arrow elk and deer hunting uh-huh oh wow and uh so i i we go back into the mountains using horses and and uh go and we'll pack in sometimes as far as ten miles back in just on horseback and we'll stay for ten days and oh wow and that's a lot of fun but it's it's not real uh conducive to taking my wife uh she doesn't appreciate being away from civilization that long and yeah yeah and uh no electricity and no you know we you you take a bath in the creek and freeze to death while you're doing it but uh yeah oh my gosh that's really roughing it uh it is but it is fun uh-huh of course i guess it takes the right personality have you only done that once or you've done that several times no no i've done that lots of times you love doing that huh yeah it's in fact i as far as i'm concerned i don't get enough really oh wow um but we'll probably go during the summertime on uh like a three-dayers probably two times and then as soon as fall comes on and the hunting season starts um-hum um-hum uh we usually get one big one and then one big one that'll last probably ten days and then one or two small ones for two or three days at a time um-hum um-hum TI switchboard well you've done a lot more camping than i have actually my husband's the one that's really the avid camper he you know has a lot more experienced and and he makes it a lot of fun for everybody though because he knows yeah um-hum yeah when you when you go with someone that's experienced and knows how to do things and it's a lot often fun for everybody else um-hum and yeah i agree it's it's always fun to go with somebody that knows how to cook over an open fire that's a little that's a little different than uh you know heat control at home and and uh uh you can have some lousy meals out there or you can have some great meals um oh yeah uh-huh yeah that's true when we were in Arkansas we'd been camping for about three days i guess and i was already tired of sleeping on the floor um-hum and we ran into a lady that told us about a resort area up there and we checked into one of these resorts and got to sleep in a a nice bed and that that was camping the right kind of camping to me um-hum um-hum well it makes a difference we're we're set up with uh camping cots and uh and uh uh self inflating mattresses and and and things like that and then and then it's not so it's still not like home but it's uh yeah right makes a little bit more comfortable um-hum yeah do you have kids that you take along yes well yeah but they don't come on the big trips they're very small too i've got a a six a three and a about a one one and a half and yeah oh wow you've really got your hands full yeah and they they enjoy the day ones we'll run up in the mountains like uh when i get off work sometimes and we're not we're not very far we're forty five minutes from some yeah uh-huh some real nice mountains here and we can go up there and build a fire and cook hot dogs and that's really not camping though that's kind of a picnic's what that is but but oh that's great uh-huh uh-huh but they enjoy that that's great that's great  okay well i think that i think it should be done you think that that spot testing for drugs is is well like it said you think it should be done permissible and where do they draw the lines yeah uh well i think at some places like not necessarily at McDonald's but yeah at plants at bigger companies what's really bad is you know that i work for TI and TI does it that's no problem i'm i don't take drugs anyway i don't have any problem with that but our own defense system doesn't do it the government doesn't do spot testing for not only for you know the FBI and defense systems and everything else but they impose it upon the on the yeah standard public and i i really don't care one way or the other i think it it prevents a lot i think guys aren't so willing to take drugs at work anymore or do drugs and go to work but but there's a lot that do yeah yeah there well there even at TI there was there was quite a change when they come out with drug testing i think it's a great deterrent and uh yeah i know a girl that works for Town and Country and she had they just they go around and they just pick a store one store in the city a month and they go down and do drug testing on all of its employees from the manager all the way down so there's no discriminating there you know they're not they're and even like TI now TI if you go out yeah and they test you positive for drugs first they send you to drug rehab they don't just throw you out the door and fire you so you know they're not out hunting heads yeah but i think it should be done across the work spectrum i don't i don't disagree with it i think it's a good thing to have but i think it should be done across the whole work spectrum i don't think that one company should do it and the other company not i don't think that TI should necessarily need to do it when the federal government doesn't you know it it it ought to be standardized somewhere somebody has to yeah you know and and they we got into a big discussion about it at work about against being against unconstitutional and against somebody's privacy rights but that you know i don't want some guy hopped up on drugs next to me working on a machine i might get my head cut off true yep you know that's why i think it's good to do testing not only when they get hired but also along the line sometimes yeah because a lot of people will have have ways of like faking the test or you know they just don't do it for a while to take the test to get the job and then they'll start up again yeah yeah i seen that too but i agree with it yeah you know i think it should be done i think it should be done everywhere i don't think it should just be done at one company or another you know like you said not at McDonald's but you know there's nothing at McDonald's except a deep fat fryer full of grease that somebody can stick their hand into or you know yeah i don't think drugs have if if i have no qualms if they wanna take drugs that's their problem it's not mine but i don't want them around me or near me or working with me or yeah yeah you know not while they're hopped up i don't want a drunk there either yeah i don't want some guy in there that's drunk working next to me either so and they're all drugs so yep i agree i think it should be done i think it should be done all the everywhere i don't think it should be done in one place and not another i think it should be done i think it should be done every time a person needs to well you know changing jobs you have to to get into TI you have to take a urines urine test anyway and they won't hire you if you test positive but once you're there yeah and they they they test you positive they'll at least send you to drug rehab or some kind of counseling anyway and i think it's working i think it's doing pretty good job yeah so i went down to Wal-Mart a couple of years ago to try to see about a job and they wanted me to take a drug test um-hum yeah most of your major companies do now well that's good you know i it prevents a lot it's a great deterrent whether or not it hm helps in the long run nobody knows but yep it works pretty good okay all right well thanks for talking sorry to wake you up it sounds like i did uh-huh nice to talk to you yeah it woke me up but that's okay yep okay see you later bye bye bye bye  okay well i don't exercise on a regular basis i think about it a lot but i chase an eighteen month old and i think if i do much else i'm gonna fall over well isn't that the truth so that's um i like exercising i feel good when i do it but i find it real hard to fit it into a schedule well i just started going back to aerobics uh-huh it's three times a week and it just the minute you get off work you got to run over there change clothes um-hum do that come home take a bath you know get cleaned up and there's always people at our house yeah and things going on and it it's hard it's hard to fit it in and i'm not one of these that loves aerobics anyway oh yeah no we're going snow skiing in March so i'm wanting to get in shape before we went so that i wouldn't just fall over dead um-hum up there but i thought as soon as this is over i am quitting i just it's not going to last long huh no and i you feel good after you you know you work out but it's always a mental chore for me to get psyched up to go yeah but once i get there i'm all right yeah well now i did find uh a video that i really liked and i just can't quite convince myself it's worth paying for yet and it was Richard Simmons Sweating to the Oldies oh i know i saw that i want that it's a lot of fun my son likes it oh you're kidding no my girlfriend and i used to work out to it right before Christmas and we put him in her playpen at her house and he thought that was the funniest thing to watch us dancing around because it's more like just dancing it is than anything else yeah and the but the fact that all the movements that they do are exactly what you need to but the fact that it's songs that you like and movements that are not so hard yeah well that's true and the only other thing about that was that they weren't maybe songs that i was real familiar with um-hum but i could feel it it it wasn't that you couldn't feel that it was working um-hum because i'm out of shape and i could feel it working but i enjoyed what i was doing so much that it was pretty much one of those i didn't care that i was really working out yeah that's the only video i have even considered buying well and it's one of three he has Sweating To The Oldies Two and Three and i haven't seen the other two but i really think they'd be a lot of fun to have i think so i think they're around twenty dollars apiece aren't they yeah yes even at a discount store i've looked at them and they're about eighteen ninety for one of them so uh that's why i say i can't quite um-hum i can't see paying some one to enjoy watching me sweat and uh not and not enjoy myself i know that was the other thing about working out i have a friend that lives in Dallas and she every day goes to some gym and they work out on all kinds of machines and the whole bit and i just thought you must be kidding uh-huh um and then they got to a while they'd go before work may be work out for an hour i thought y'all are eaten up with it just yeah just eaten up with it but they're young and they're single and oh you're kidding you people are crazy oh well there's half of it right there that kind of stuff um-hum and i said well that's what's the matter with you get married and you won't care have those babies and it changes really i don't have any children i all my friends do i've got one that the minute she had the baby she lost every bit of the weight uh-huh uh-huh and was right back a skinny little thing again and i thought you make me sick yeah oh i agree i agree but she's young she's about twenty twenty two uh-huh and i thought well that's what it is you're just you're just a child well that's a part of it i bet because i'm well i'm twenty nine now i just turned twenty nine and i haven't lost hardly anything and my son's a year and a half um-hum some people i don't know i've got another friend that i'm twenty nine and she's twenty nine after she had her son she said i was just too busy to eat she she had a two year old and then she had a had another one and she says i just don't have time to eat she says i one i'm fooling with one and then i'm fooling with the other one wrong and she said i just at night time i think boy i don't think i've had anything eat today well there's no way no there's no way i i make time to eat and that's how she lost hers yeah well really because when he particularly his age now he and i eat the same things and if i'm not eating he doesn't eat very well um-hum so um-hum i have to eat well yeah you did so good on the others you keep doing that one he's stripping Crayolas uh-huh yeah that was always fun oh yeah well what else were we supposed to talk about oh why we're motivated to do what we do oh and your motivation was your ski trip yeah we're just getting in shape for ski trip uh-huh my husband is  hi i'm Bridget hi Bridget i'm Gunner i'm here in Dallas are you i'm in Lubbock oh you are oh okay yeah i go to school at Tech oh okay okay you ready for me to push one yeah sure am okay okay okay so what do you think about the elderly and their health care well uh i think there uh you know need to have uh some some means of taking care of them in a in a reasonable and uh uh i guess respectful way uh-huh and uh it's uh i guess my biggest problem is that uh they seem to uh be uh be you know put in nursing homes and just forgotten about that's yeah i think that's really sad you know have you uh ever spent much time or worked around one or anything yeah i have um my great grandmother was in one and i used to go visit her a lot i think it's sad because one it's so expensive oh yeah just to put them in there and it's such a traumatic decision anyway and then it's like no one goes and sees them i think that's really sad i mean that i didn't even think about that what i first was thinking about this topic and stuff and that's just that's that's amazes me you know is there uh uh well shoot i guess there's no uh Medicare i don't think pays for it no i don't think so um um i don't know it's just the whole thing is just kind of amazing to me uh-huh uh but they need someone to take care of them you know uh-huh you can kind of see both sides i mean the people that have to be in one you know should be or people that are just put in one you know that do not need serious you know medical care i think that's kind of sad yeah and a lot of other countries though uh uh you know basically like family takes them yeah that's uh-huh and uh i guess take them for as long as they are you know as long as they live yeah yeah should go back to that think more people should do that well i yeah i do too hard as it may sound or be for some people it's not really that hard um least it would be easier especially now that all the you know everybody is getting older and living longer and uh-huh that's true uh you know it's it's there's going to be more and more folks yeah there's going to be more older people hm whether they like to admit it or not yeah that's true though i didn't think about that either people got to think about that and just i just think it's it's kind of sad even knowing if your you know if your parents would even want to go in one or not you know i mean my parents are like no way i know there's no way they would ever want to be put in one um yeah and i know that my parents plan to take care of their parents you know if it ever gets to the point where they can't take care of themselves you know they're going to go to Florida or whatever to take care of them that's what they have to do because they don't want to just put them in a nursing home yeah they don't think that's right um yeah that is uh that's difficult i tell you i guess it would depend on a lot of things like like financial especially and depending on how old they are and how you know i can see if like my grandmother whose mother used to be in a nursing home she used to go up there and see her every day whose my great-grandmother was in one she used to go see her every day and that is great but when she got sick then you know she can't go see her and stuff and you can't expect so i guess it would depend on how old they were too uh-huh because if if the parents if the children were too old to take care of the parents then i don't think that would be very good either yeah yeah hm pretty touchy topic yeah it sure is i know like uh uh lot of places it's like hundred dollars a day oh yeah at least you know they're pretty expensive i know but uh but people always figure it as if they had a live in nurse too that's you know just as expensive is it i don't even know it is because i know when my grandmother was looking to put her mother in that is a big ordeal she's like well it's just expensive to have a nurse twenty four hours a day than it is to put her in a a place where at least there's other people you know yeah i mean and she went and saw her every day like i said and that's good i think because i don't think if you just put them in there and forget about them i don't think that's right yeah yeah really think that's sad  well Barbara whenever you get around to purchasing your next new car what are going to be the chief considerations one of the main considerations is safety and quietness and um economy what about you uh i'm interested primarily in reliability uh well i have found most of the cars now are pretty reliable um i haven't found any that have left me down yet what are your specific requirements American or foreign well well uh let me give you a little history on that i drove i drove uh GM cars for a long time and in fact i had a a Chevrolet and it ended up costing it was only about five or six years old and i was paying on the average a hundred dollars a month in repair bills on that thing and i just couldn't handle that so i took a deep breath and bought a Toyota and have lived happily ever after since then yes yes i've had two small problems neither one of which left me by the side of the road really uh with the Toyota in the last five years and and when i was buying that i was concerned primarily with reliability reliability and but i also wanted a hatchback because you know you you sometimes you have to carry bags of fertilizer um-hum uh so well it is a sports car that i got which is my first probably my last one because comfort is not high on the list when you get a sports car do you have a family for comfort or no just you just me well i had the same problem whenever i had a General Motors car i had a Chevy and uh just me it was constantly giving me valve problems i had this constant ticking of the valves and uh i switched over to Chrysler Plymouth and i haven't had a lick of problem does your car have an air bag yes it does but just on the driver's side yeah i wish they would come out with them everywhere on the passenger side too yeah i suspect they probably will and i think on my next car i'll be concerned i'll i think i will want antilock brakes i've heard good things about them it was the first year it was offered on the Toyota Supra when i bought mine uh-huh and i was a little nervous about some new technology i mean i'd got to where i had real this real hate relationship with anything that looked like service department at a dealership well i found out they're pretty good whenever uh especially on weather like we're having today and and uh the roads are so slippery um-hum the antilock brakes are one of the better ones to have yeah yeah i think i'd i'd like that i don't know i i have a friend who drives an Acura Legend which is very comfortable car um-hum and it it makes me more aware of how uncomfortable mine is every time i ride in his car my daughter has a Civic Honda and that's a real comfortable car to sit in yeah which surprised me uh-huh oh is it uh-huh yeah i have a Chrysler now i just bought and uh it's real comfortable and i'm very happy with it but Chrysler has a good warranty that they have to stand behind so i haven't had any worries about that that's one thing i go for in a car is their warranty and uh what does and doesn't come under that warrantee but they have the seven thousand uh seven thousand seventy thousand miles or seven years i believe yes uh-huh and uh bumper to bumper and i have no complaints well that's great so far with mine that's great so if you had to do it again you'd buy another Chrysler do you think would you i sure would Dodge Plymouth Chrysler something in that line that's yeah that's interesting because i mean i i was hearing a just on on the way home from work the other day i heard something on the news about the trade deficit for December the figures were some some very large number um-hum i was thinking golly and and you know it's partly my fault i mean not in December but i i really have a problem buying Japanese things and for years i bought American and i don't know i hope by the time this car wears out and i hope that's not for another five or ten years well i hope that i can get an American one at that time well that's another fallacy because uh so many people say that's a requirement has to be American but uh did you know that my Chrysler has foreign parts in it and so does Chevy and so does Ford oh sure it yeah so um i often hear people saying well i want to buy American or i like the foreign something and uh they're built right here like the foreign cars are even built over here Datsun has a
