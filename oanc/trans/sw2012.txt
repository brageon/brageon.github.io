 all right uh-huh okay what uh what was your name Patricia and yours is Charley right yeah Patricia okay Charley yeah well i i listen to the radio whenever i can i watch TV TV news at night but i'm really a big reader so i read that paper from front to back but i don't think either of the papers i get here in the Metroplex are that great oh yeah uh-huh especially the Star Telegram i get that one it's it's not the highest quality i don't think and i get the Dallas Morning News and it's kind of fading no not the Morning News i get the Times Herald what do you get yeah um i read the um Dallas Morning News we we've moved here about six month or no eight months ago i think oh where'd you move from North Carolina oh and so i tried the Times Herald first and then i tried the tried them both and i ended up back with the Dallas Morning News yeah i think it's the better of the papers yeah i don't i don't and i pretty well read it uh i kind of i mean i go through the whole paper i don't read every uh-huh Karen would you not roll around here please run on run on from out here uh i don't uh i i pretty well look at it all the way through every day and then i listen to i listen on i have a forty five minute drive so i listen to the news on National Public Radio yeah i do too oh yeah i love that i think that's so good once you've listen to that you can't believe the regular radio news yeah yeah and they have a lot of um early breaking stories before before anyone else does so i kind of like that huh it uh-huh yeah i like i like that too yeah and i guess uh i'm getting used to the Dallas Morning News i didn't like it as much as the paper that from where we moved but uh oh i don't think any of our papers in the area are great papers you might have had a really excellent one yeah but you know you have to get a local paper or you won't know what's going on that's why i get the Fort Worth one which i didn't do for years before we moved over here but yeah it's the only way i could find out what was going on in my own city of Arlington so i had to subscribe to it finally yeah we used to live in Fort Worth and we got that paper that was like a number of years ago and i liked it i of course uh that was probably fifteen years ago oh really oh yeah well the editorial page is pretty good of course they you know it's all things they get from other places yeah but uh i'm not really thrilled with with the paper do you listen to National do you listen you say listen to National Public Radio yeah i listen to that quite a bit when i can yeah i listen to it i guess uh well every day on the way in and every day on the way home yeah you really get a whole story you know the news on television is probably i think the worst source yeah because it's like eight minutes of top news out of the whole half hour by the time you take all those you know the ads and the sports and the features and the the cute little talk you know uh-huh yeah i don't know i guess um i used to watch TV news but i don't hardly ever watch it any more uh uh i'll catch the ten o'clock sometimes or if there's a story that i'm really interested in i'll i'll try to yeah i'll turn it on if there's a how about Nightline do you ever watch any programs like that oh i love Nightline yeah i like that yeah i like that too but it's it's hard sometimes to stay up for me that late yeah it really is if you have to do something early where do you work do you work at TI No you don't work at TI do you no i work for a mechanical contractor um where where where do you have to drive to uh Farmers Branch from Plano so takes about forty five minutes oh yeah you go against all that traffic i guess on LBJ or something yeah well no i go kind of a back way but it still it takes forty five or fifty minutes oh yeah well my husband drives from here in Arlington to TI on Central well yeah he listens to a lot of news but yeah well that's a good drive yeah well do you read any uh do you do read any magazines or anything like that yeah um well just Time as far as news i mean we get a lot of magazines but that that's the only news one that i get yeah yeah do you read it pretty regular oh yeah oh uh well i didn't like it this week it was just all about California and i don't don't care that much about uh did you get it this week no i don't we don't take we don't take many magazines occasionally i'll i'll see one somewhere and look at it but um i don't uh seems like it takes too much time or something the whole issue's is oh uh-huh well that's true no we do get Time and um i i read it pretty well you know i especially read the political news uh um i like to keep up with that but um um uh-huh like you said i think the best source of all is the Public Radio and Nightline well Nightline's great especially when something exciting is going on you know yeah uh-huh then i then i'll really make a point well you know it used to come on at ten thirty which was better but then they put that silly Entertainment Tonight yeah so it comes on at eleven now yeah so i'm still used to North Carolina time it was um oh it was eleven up there i think right oh was it yeah but that's still that's awful late yeah i know i wish it would come on earlier but obviously the sitcoms make more money or they you know or they wouldn't have it on at eleven but uh uh-huh uh well i guess we've exhausted that subject well who do you think's going to run for President next year since you're up on all your news guess we've got Bush again but yeah uh i don't know who's going to run on the Democrat side um right uh Patrick Buchanan supposedly was thinking of running against Bush or he just announced today is that right i don't know if he's announced or he's thinking about it but it was on the news huh well that's kind of a futile effort probably wouldn't wouldn't you think yeah well i would think but it uh it might scare Bush a little  all right i guess tonight's subject is to discuss current events and how we keep up on current events and if we're right satisfied with with the uh coverage that we receive that's right um thinking about it some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is uh i enjoy reading the newspaper but uh quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper and so uh i enjoy watching some of the TV highlights and also um some of the news periodicals uh weekly magazines and uh at work i also have uh management summary reports that uh give basically a lot of the current events uh how about yourself well unlike you i don't i don't i like to read the paper but i basically don't do it every day and i um i usually watch uh either Good Morning America or the Today Show every morning while i'm you know whatever i'm doing and i watch that i usually watch the news either at uh-huh you know early evening or at ten o'clock so i get it from TV a lot i get Time magazine i read Time magazine um that's one i read pretty regularly and uh right right oh yes okay you think that that's uh pretty adequate coverage and you get the thing about it you know now that i've found found is that we get such good coverage on TV or at least such i don't know attempted thoroughness of coverage by the time you get the Time Magazine Magazine there's nothing in it you don't know uh-huh it's historic events huh yeah if if you know then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something because really i thought lately there's nothing new in the Time Magazine oh okay you know it's it's basically you've heard everything yes and uh you might you might get a little more thorough uh account of something but really um i don't know i so i get most of mine from television yes i would say um i found out too that uh quite often if i see something on television that i want more in depth uh understanding or or get want to know more about it that the the newspaper or uh i read Newsweek can give you a better and more a thorough coverage of what i've heard on TV but uh um i found out that also on on TV that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on CNN and and like you said the the news shows that are that are happening and you can read some more about it if you want to um i found out though that or i feel that a lot of the stuff on TV and the newspapers is negative there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news or or bad news and uh it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear to hear some good news right and i i think there's an attempt to do that uh you know i think people there's a mild attempt for that but i think basically we basically associate news with bad news and uh yes we do or or or catastrophes or problems or crises or uh you know i think our concept of news isn't isn't necessarily events that happen it's more negative like you said true true but i i think people try to on the on TV i think they try to throw in good stuff but it doesn't uh it doesn't sway the vote um-hum i've heard an interesting interesting comment also that uh with budget cuts and uh expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media whereas before they would be able to have a in-depth analysis or uh investigative reporting on certain topics and issues but that takes time that takes a lawful lot of money and commitment and and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing and go after it you know it's quite easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer um-hum and uh find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things so i don't know i guess the economy is is effecting also the news media um-hum and we have to pay that price but um i don't know i don't know it's it's interesting and i think that now a days with communications the way they are also that we can see global events happening as as they occur all over the world like the right you know the war last winter was certainly a good example of that because we saw every single thing practically exactly we saw yes it you know twenty years ago thirty years ago we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege or or luxury to to view that i mean you know i remember well just the things that are covered i remember watching the World Series during the earthquake and just seeing that happen i mean you know that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake so oh yeah uh-huh and the and the announcers you know grabbing i mean it's like that was just something because that was like live and real oh yeah yeah like you said and then of course one thing i think too is with television  well what's your favorite baseball team Rita well i suppose i supposed to say the Rangers right is that what i is the million million dollar question here well this isn't a a a true false or right or wrong test here yeah uh um you know i would like to say the Rangers but unfortunately they're not i was from Illinois and my favorite team was the White Sox not a Cubbies fan huh no no my family my dad was but i turned out to be a White Sox fan well that's all right how do you expect them to do this year lived in Chicago yeah they did pretty well okay what'd you think the World Series well i'll tell you i just uh moved down from South Dakota in July and uh in South Dakota the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living um-hum and so everybody was a Twins fan and i was kind of uh didn't have much interest in the Twins you know it was it was kind of pathetic i mean we only had two radio stations and one of them broadcast every Twins game live you know and the other one was country so you didn't really have a lot of choice did you so that's right it was Twins there or you know Skip Williams or country yeah oh uh and i was routing for the Twins myself because uh they a couple of Ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here uh went to Minnesota and we used to tease about my son and i used to have a bet going because about some of the players that had moved from here to Minnesota but it was interesting it certainly was an exciting series anyway it sure was it sure was what do you think's gonna happen to the Rangers how can we predict well i would i would like to assume assume assume that they're gonna do do better this whole this coming year i would sure hope so anyway when we moved down uh i was able to go to my first you know baseball game and um-hum thought this is great this is incredible so i i became a Rangers fan i i didn't really have one in South Dakota so i adopted the Rangers or rather they adopted me i guess um-hum and uh it was just exciting you know you can watch baseball on TV and they hit the long ball and it looks like wow they really hit that ball but when you go to the ballpark it's really not all that far no you know and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you and oh isn't it though you know but oh i i think going to ballpark it really really makes it because then you watch it on TV you feel like you're more a part of it too that's right that's right you know well i'm a great sports enthusiast so i love you know baseball teams and they in fact on the news tonight Nolan Ryan was on there he was being he was put in the which i'd never knew exist the Restaurant Hall of Fame the Restaurant Hall the Restaurant Hall of Fame inducted him tonight huh and he uh says he's coming back you know and he doesn't know how many years i mean to pitch he'll be at least one more and he said he's been saying one more and it's been two and three might be two and three more he likes it right that's right and he's still doing great still doing excellent yeah that's right you know and he said i get a kick out of it uh you know he's he's such a nice man well didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the Rangers yeah and he you know when he quits at being active he will go into you know being a managing and yeah you know being a coach i'm sure management right but he's uh he certainly is a good example uh for the kids that's right you know you like to have someone like that you could point to to say see what a fine man that he is you know some of the like uh Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when when uh Nolan Ryan started pitching that's right and it's just incredible to think that there's uh there are players who are the sons of ballplayers that used to play against Nolan or with Nolan um-hum you know and now their sons are oh he's been a legend for so many years you know and i don't know were you here had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at UT with his son his son pitched for UT and he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers huh-uh i wasn't yeah it was a i think it was a a little early part of the summer and uh was it Nolan against uh oh it it was Ryan against Ryan huh Nolan against Ryan against Ryan yeah his son pitched for UT well that is neat and uh only uh Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want the son getting too nervous about this whole thing game is a game you know well the Rangers uh-huh really uh knocked the socks off of them which you would expect you know anyway but Nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something right you know of the game to let  hi my name is Donna Donahue Donna hi i'm Lynn Randall yes okay i have a cold this morning so you have to excuse my my sound here um i'm from uh Plano Texas where are you from Plano Texas oh okay that's nice and easy um let's see would you like to to start or would you okay yes sure that'd be just fine we might as well go ahead okay um did you want me to start oh i'm sorry oh i have to start okay well um my oh i did i did push one shall i push it again you think no okay um my um yeah you have to you have to push the button uh-huh push one did you yet push the button oh okay okay no no that's that's it i love to cross stitch and my husband and my son who is now eleven watch so much sports on TV that lately i have been uh-huh just in a cross stitch frenzy because i cannot stand being in the same room with the TV on with all the sports so so much that i have to sit i can sit there as long as i'm cross stitching and uh-huh while i'm doing that so that that's one of my my favorite hobbies that i that i like to what what about you well i do cross stitch also okay in fact i was just sitting here getting ready to start some things so um i've done it for a number of years and uh so that is one of my favorite things to do also i find it very relaxing and and so like if i um oh i do too i you know if i haven't done it for a while i like to have a i just like to have a project going um because i think it it's it's just a real good thing to have yes it is i i enjoy it too and i have found a wonderful framer on Fifteenth Street down in Old Plano um about two doors down from uh Nooks and Crannies uh-huh um who who does he's really an artist and he does a wonderful wonderful job with i just give him my things and he triple mats everything and he has really nice frames uh-huh and i think when you it's very satisfying after you do something like that to have it framed and hang it up um it it's always that's kind of the fun part now do you think he's reasonable in terms of prices very reasonable i have brought something to Michaels and i was very disappointed in it and it was just a small little picture for my daughter's room in fact there were two little cross stitches i did for her room and um uh-huh apparently two people framed them differently they two people took instead of one person doing doing the framing two people did it because the mats were just different sizes and to put them next to each other it just didn't look right and um right uh um-hum uh-huh he is so reasonable that um and he has all these unusual frames that he uses his name is um i guess i can just tell you his name it's Matt Inc sure and it's um i think the address is ten eleven and a half on Fifteenth because it's a skinny little door next to i think Bows and so is it is it so it's upstairs and this little skinny door it's right on Fifteenth Street right down right down by the railroad tracks his name is Dan well i'm glad to know that okay so it's closer to the railroad tracks then from Nooks and Crannies okay yes closer to the right down down from Nooks and Crannies and it's Matte M A T T E Inc I N C period okay okay and um he does such a beautiful job i'll take something in i do simple cross stitches mostly samplers and a few that are a little bit more complicated but i don't really um with three kids running around it's it's hard for me to get something too intricate uh-huh so i like something that's kind of quick and and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and he'll just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out little bits of uh-huh little bits of um colors that he'll pick from your from your work and and matte it with that little color and it just it just makes this wonderful piece of art um um uh-huh so um i'm real real happy with them and they have some really nice books down there have you seen the books in the small shops in um oh yes uh-huh uh-huh on Fifteenth Street you know i'm fairly fairly new to the area so i'm always glad to find a nice little shop that has different books but uh i basically i basically buy most of my things there in Nooks and Crannies at that at that store um there used to be a wonderful store on Fifteenth but it closed and she had fabulous things but do you uh-huh oh it's been closed a couple of years so really in my now i didn't i in fact i was just there yesterday but i didn't go across the street i saw that there's a place across the street i didn't go in to that place but i generally buy most of my things in Nooks and Crannies uh-huh uh-huh do you um now i really usually don't get the real expensive linens to work on which uh maybe that's what you do it's probably really really beautiful to do that but i i just get the regular piece of cloth you know and do it on that but um yeah yeah well it depends on what i'm doing i tend to um see i make up most of my own things and and so um oh okay in fact i make up almost everything i do now i used to do uh you know kits and all or i'd use books but i i tend not to do that much anymore um uh-huh uh-huh so it depends on what i'm doing as to what i use i recently did one on linen and that's the first time uh-huh  okay Laurel so i'd like to know um what what do you do in lawn and garden what uh what's what's of interest to you and how do you go about it well i have a town home so i don't do a lot of regular maintenance but i do have a large garden out in back so we do a lot of things with perennials and uh also a few annual plants uh and then every year i grow a garden oh you do you do actually uh grow a garden to produce food yes uh-huh so how much room do you have um we have no virtually no room out in front and then in the back i'd say we have about an eighth of an acre um-hum and we pretty much fill it up with uh like i said perennials things that aren't don't have to fool with every year but then i've got uh a twenty five by twenty area that i do gardening as far as you know tomatoes and cucumbers and beans and oh that's what i was uh curious about i was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and and then put down your garden and then put them back in later or something like that so you no we have a separate area for the garden uh-huh you do have a separate area yeah and last year was the first year we tried two new things we tried corn and we tried a watermelon oh uh-huh well tell me this uh Laurel do you enjoy do you enjoy doing that kind of work and do you have the time to relax so that you can take advantage of it uh i enjoy doing it on a limited basis i don't think that if i i the reason i bought a town house is so that i wouldn't i get i'm allergic to grass so i don't mow grass or anything like that so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i i don't believe i would enjoy it but just on the limited basis that i do it i do enjoy it very much uh-huh well i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view i'm not allergic to things and i i moved here in State College quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land so actually i have nine acres and uh for many years i grew sweet corn oh wow uh and and my kids were there and so we set up a shop there and uh i would uh collect the corn very carefully ear by ear and it was never more than one to two hours old and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn because they knew it was individually picked and very very fresh how about that so we had a nice thing going there and it was delicious i really enjoyed that and then i also have a a garden oh it's probably uh twenty five by thirty or forty something like that that i put in my normal food garden things each year and uh i have a little bit of everything or a lot whole lot of everything in the actually i love uh broccoli brussels sprouts and i have all kinds of tomatoes kale and all those good things and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use so i get out of that amount of work at any rate well that's nice it is it is very very nice i i really enjoy my problem is not having enough enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as i would like i enjoy it very much that much land requires an awful lot of time yes it does uh and actually i had a pony there for twenty five years and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing so he had his own backyard garden too how about that but that that worked out very nicely too i built him a barn back there where in the part of my corn field and he lived in that but uh as far as gardening is concerned we do enjoy it my wife is in charge of the flowers she does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property and we should have you know an acre an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of and she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things we have blueberries blackberries i have two or three uh apple trees the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year my neighbor has pear trees and um oh blueberries all kinds of food around there if we just had time to take advantage of it my wife has spent probably i don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears because there were so many of them and i have been totally engulfed with Golden Delicious apples i just couldn't handle the the amount of them that we got this year it's really been a remarkable year well i bet you could answer a question for me what's a good apple to bake pies with i use my Golden Delicious and they make delicious pies are there many uh there's an enough  okay so what do you uh think is the uh the worst culprit for air pollution well i think it's it's probably a combination of things um factories that that burn coal as uh an energy source with uh sulfur and nitrogen contaminants you know and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides um-hum uh those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain and i think that's that's probably hurting us a little bit it's hurting you know other countries it's hurting Germany for example too and some other parts of Europe where they where they have high industry so we're not the lone ranger here yeah well it's i uh it's hard to put the finger on uh what's worse you know the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion um with uh your hydrocarbons uh yeah causing the damage in which hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit but i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot well well i notice on one of these uh home shopping networks they were selling these uh halogen uh fire extinguishers yeah and the halogen is uh an ozone depleter and it got hydrocarbons in there it's a very clean uh fire extinguisher but it's you know really bad on the environment yeah huh yeah i guess i missed that one uh yeah automobiles of course are contributing too and you know how how we are with our love affair with the auto oh yeah yeah kind of hard to do anything about that i guess i know uh in the Twin Cities area i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right but they had a new policy where in order to get your uh your license uh your car license uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards yeah and uh we we have that here too but it's part of the inspection sticker you know they put a probe in your exhaust pipe and and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out and yeah so that's you know that's the way they're dealing with it here yeah and yeah i guess that was just mainly in the cities there and i as far as where i live i don't have to do that but yeah i have an old car which i doubt would uh would uh pass the inspection a seventy six and uh you know there's no way i would put in a lot of money to to repair it to meet standards yeah it probably be difficult anyway yeah so although i do what i can to to cut down pollution but uh i was just reading an article in uh Mother Earth News Mother Earth News Magazine yeah and uh they've got a new um you know a lot of places are burning wood a lot of lot of people are burning wood those of us who have i've got a place in the country and uh yeah um-hum and uh they've had catalytic converters you know catalytic converters on those on uh i think they're required in California and Oregon and and Washington but they've had out those for quite a while and somebody's come up with a new one that uh sort of it's a it's a catalytic converter it's a catalytic it's a plate that fits in you know into the smoke pipe yeah and uh apparently it sort of feeds itself the more smoke is produced uh the you know after you get to like five hundred degrees the the higher it gets so the the more complete the combustion is and it sounds real neat i haven't seen them priced anywhere yet but that that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on you know old old uh yeah older stoves that don't have any kind of EPA requirements on them that might help a little bit especially in some places we're really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out yeah now sometimes we get a kind of a especially in in uh autumn it seems like we get a kind of a brown haze sitting on us but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well probably blowing up there to you guys yeah yeah well well around here our we get the well depends you know either in the in the winter time it it blows it your way and in the summer time we probably get yours yeah it comes back yeah i really think that um you know we're doing some some important things education uh raising consciousness awareness uh and i know school kids i work for school district here and uh you know this is one of the big things with kids kids are writing letters to the newspapers about you know uh telling adults to clean up their act and yeah it's uh you know it hope we're not too late with it we're we're uh we're having all kinds of recycling yeah well it it that's that's a a big thing too i i know it's has nothing do with air pollution but i kind of look at the way people treat our  now what was your first name again Bob Bob okay uh how how do you feel about uh gun control Bob it's it's kind of like abortion it's kind of a touchy subject but um i i feel that yeah it is any person is uh has the right to be armed but i don't think they should have an arsenal yeah i don't believe in uh automatic weapons i don't believe in in uh having antitank guns and um i i there's just there's just too many uh weapons around yeah uh i kind of i agree i guess i don't i don't think that we need uh um these these automatic or semiautomatic rifles even i mean i don't really even care that the i don't know if you hunt or not but i don't even care that some of the hunters say they they like them i mean no i'm i'm not that you know uh maybe they use them for legitimate purposes but they're all you know folks are getting them and using them for not so legitimate to say the least yeah no purposes what do you feel about uh um how do you feel about a waiting period i yeah i think that's a a good thing in in the sense that it um it stops someone that is acting on a impulse however uh anyone that has a revenge factor in mind is is going to weight that out right um most um Dallas has if you read in the papers recently um the um uh murder ratio in Dallas one point uh seven i think per day uh-huh uh and ninety somewhat percent of these know uh the perpetrator it's it's not it's not criminals that are going out and killing people yeah it it's people with guns that are that are shooting other people yeah it's probably not someone that's running down to the store and buying one either is it probably someone who's got one already yeah no someone that's got one and and and for some reason whatever um they became uh enraged or you know it uh some of these are somebody's dating somebody's uh girl friend or ex-wife or um a person that they know and and it's it's again something that you know it's it's a uh it's a decision of uh emotion not um it's not something you can really control usually i don't think you can uh-huh i don't think you can regulate it if they don't use a gun maybe they'll use a knife hm yeah yeah i mean yeah i don't know if i mean yeah if someone wants to do someone in they're gonna do it whether they have a gun or not uh what do you think about that um that uh sure deal with the police officer evidently evidently um i guess they speculate that it was teenagers that that somehow got a hold of a gun well yeah yeah yeah and and you look at the you know drive by shootings and things like that with with young uh people involved it's it's it's a very volatile situation it's a funny world that we live in yeah i i we just moved here about eight or nine months ago from from uh a little town in North Carolina um-hum and uh we have lived in Fort Worth before and and in Houston for a while so we we're you know we're accustomed to the big city but my kids weren't in in the age they are now they're in uh high school and junior middle school um-hum and the middle the high schools around here um man police have come in and and uh you know they got they raid the school and take out ten revolvers you know i mean it's just uh yeah sure so it seems like um you know it seems like and no and that's not a case of someone flipping out and running down and buying one so a waiting period isn't gonna help that but it seems like that there ought to be something that could be done to at least make it harder for those kids to get their hands on guns well that that's parental control yeah and and that's you know that extends beyond guns that extends to drugs and everything else that that is bad in our society and and we don't have the we don't have the parental control that that we need yeah that's true that's that's a there's there's there's no deterrent um there really isn't and and you're not going to stop uh guns from being on the streets again if they don't use a gun they'll use something else and and then you take away the fact that uh somebody has a right to protect their property  i was gonna say my uh college is Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota and our head football coach Dennis Miller used to be an assistant coach at BYU oh really so i thought that was kind of an interesting interesting coincidence huh so you went to what college uh Northern State University in Aberdeen South Dakota and what did you graduate in i just in what major or what year yeah major uh international business oh really and you i'm going to BYU and i'm going into nursing okay so well that sounds interesting ah how long of a program is that forever seems like anyways it's about five years but it's probably gonna take me longer because i didn't decide to major in that until uh about a year and a half after i was already in school so you know i read a study once and it said that uh like thirty four percent of uh college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program oh really that sounds it took me it took me five years you know you just you get started and and you change your mind or you wanna pick up a second major if you're management you you you decide i'll i'll take that marketing it's just what three more classes yeah yeah you know and it it just just doesn't happen that you get out in four years um-hum but so what is your advice to my advice is is uh picking a college look for at the student to faculty ratio you know if you're gonna go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one i don't think you're gonna have as meaningful of of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one um-hum is that what was yours more like yeah ours was about twenty six to one really oh that's great yeah which is you know it it's interesting but it it's what i thought was nice is you could always there was always time to talk to professor you know and and they knew you um-hum you weren't just in their class you know and so you could you could go talk to them in their office hours at any time and or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever you know you could sit down and talk to them about a problem they were always willing to help you out so but our house i i put that against uh my high school where we had uh a biology class of three hundred and fifty students and wow in high school yeah it was a biology lecture class oh and you know it it wow it just wasn't the same you're sitting there and you're taking notes and you know you got a computerized test scores with multiple choice because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test or you know a three hundred and three hundred and fifty person short answer test um-hum and it just wasn't the same you you'd run you'd pass the teacher in high school you know and even in high school you could say hi to your teachers and unless you're in that biology class and they just you know they'd look at you like do i know you or should i know you um-hum yeah there's it's the classes here are pretty big so it's hard to get individual help it's kind of you're on your own do you get uh a lot of tutoring or no very little i mean well like my for example i have i'm in a chemistry class right now and there's tons of students in it and there's one TA for the whole class um-hum and he only has certain office hours and so there's only certain times you can talk to him and and you could get there and his office hours could i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have forty two people waiting to talk to him and you still wouldn't get to talk to him anyway right yeah well what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college oh man i think your advice is good um let's see my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college that's excellent advice because i i didn't and i took ton of classes that i didn't need to and um i don't know i just feel like i'm it's it's gonna take me a lot longer than and not that's always bad but it's i don't know it's frustrating i guess well it it it does get it you know you get to the point where it's i'm never gonna get done right you know i i mean i was taking summer classes and finally i said let me get out of here yep but uh no that's good advice even if you don't have your major decided on have an idea of what you think you might want you know so you don't want management but you think you want business um-hum  so how many um credit cards do you have um i think i'm down to one oh my gosh i wish i was that way is that why you said i had more experience than you well no i was pulling your leg oh well how how do you use your credit card i mean do you just keep it in reserve or i i well the way i'd like to try and use it is um you you you make your purchases at at prime buying time uh-huh and then you pay that off and don't use it until uh it's paid off uh-huh that's that's my ideal way uh-huh how how do you use it emergencies come along and i and i use it yeah that's understandable exactly uh like uh hm my car uh had a major problem and seven hundred dollars and uh-huh right right uh things just come up and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to um-hum um-hum well actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have um and i use them you know like my American Express i use for you know gas things like that and i pay that off monthly and then um some other credit cards like store credit cards you know i do have them up there a little bit but uh um-hum i try not to use them too often but living in this area and like i live fifteen miles west of Washington DC it's a very expensive area so hm yeah sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something yeah well i i know i was uh up in there had a lot of credit cards and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble so we just right disposed of them paid them off and uh-huh got out of it uh-huh well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that i just yeah um-hum now are you married that you both you and your wife use a credit card or well i just yeah yeah uh-huh well now we pretty much just pay cash for uh-huh hm as much as we can there uh uh-huh our our only credit card is Sears so uh-huh hm and i have that for automotive purposes right right well well that's great um everyone i know here uses um credit cards like they're going out of business to be honest with you hm yeah yeah it's it's just too easy basically uh just get yourself in trouble with those yeah yeah yeah the only other one i have i have like a Diner's Club through my um where i work i see so that i use uh because i travel some so i use that and i don't really have to worry about that because i only use it for business so i automatically have the money to pay it off yeah but hm uh i wouldn't mind uh you know getting back into one if they would you know you start out at a low limit and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit uh-huh and and if i can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred and i can never go over that or something like that then that's fine but they uh-huh uh-huh eventually get's up there to five thousand ten thousand whatever fifty thousand forget it i don't want that um-hum yeah um the temptation's too great yeah hm so i don't know just uh writing checks is just as easy i guess yeah that's true that's true but so i guess uh we've kind of exhausted this uh topic yeah well really what what can you yeah you can't say too much about it really other than you use them or you don't use them you like them or you don't like them so um-hum i guess uh they don't care care if we end it early so uh hopefully uh you have a good Thanksgiving that's coming up and okay you too and then uh maybe we'll talk again yeah maybe you're the furthest person actually that i've talked i've talked to a lot of people in Texas yeah yeah Texas is the big one yeah so okay then well bye now okay okay bye-bye  okay okay what do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasion of privacy in your opinion well uh i guess uh one that comes to mind is um the way the credit bureaus operate i i agree one hundred percent especially whenever it's like they keep stuff on your record like for seven years and they don't bother like yeah i know at one time i was unemployed or something and and they kept they kept it on my record for like seven months even though that i seven years even though that like you know i i um yeah they sent a letter in but they didn't bother to include the letter for the explanation where i got behind or anything like that yeah yeah we had a problem with them back oh i don't know five or seven years ago where it uh some stuff was on there that was incorrect and it was and it was real hard to and well that too get it get it fixed but they um they share that information with a lot of people that well that happened with me i um i had had a a doctor's appointment at at uh University of Chapel Hill Hospital uh-huh and there was two William Parrishes and they were charging me for this other person and i went through like six months of you know because they kept billing me and billing me and billing me i was like you know i'm not this person i'm not seeing seeing you why are you charging me uh-huh and i mean they turned me into the Credit Bureau they even held my taxes oh they did yeah i mean it went a long ways and it you mean they held your uh refund over my refund that you you know and it was it was a mess and finally i got it straightened out but it it took me almost a year to get that straightened out and it was for something you know uh huh another William Parrish that wasn't paying his bills or either else they wasn't you know charging him yeah but it was really weird huh well let's see um i think the biggest thing i think that are is not just well not for the average person i i think like the media's is is getting a little bit overboard on the invasion of privacy on like different on public figures yeah that some of the stuff that they're they're like on public figures like the tabloids and stuff are are saying that it's like really like i think Joan Collins i believe is believe right now is having a lawsuit against yeah think it's the National Enquirer for taking pictures of her when she was getting undressed in her bedroom and published them and oh yeah huh i some things i think should be private i would hate to know if i was getting undressed in the bedroom somebody was taking pictures of me you know yeah someone someone between the curtain was huh and i believe they've got something now i read in some science magazine or something where they have a infrared camera that can take pictures like with inside your house to see if you have any drugs or anything like that i think that's kind of an invasion of privacy too hm yeah i guess um another thing comes to mind is some of the quote unquote routine uh traffic stops they do that man they did that around Raleigh all the time yeah you know they set those roadblocks up oh yeah to see if you've been drinking and driving yeah yeah and you know and and uh boy they just you know they have no reason to be stopping you and they just uh they stop you and and uh look in your car a little bit you know lean in the windows anyway well i i i had something like that happen to me too um i worked for the Hilton for a while as a banquet waiter and um one night whenever i got off work you know it was like two or three in the morning it was a big party and you know i pulled out of that little road where you know pull out of the Hilton on the old Wake Forest Road going home um-hum um-hum and i looked up and it was i seen you know blue lights on and i thought God i just pull on the road it can't be me so you know like i pulled off the road and i pulled you know pulled off the side road and the car followed you know the police car followed you know pulled me over and next thing i know there was eight cop cars and they all got out with guns and everything you're kidding and it it really scared me really bad and they were just stopping you because you were leaving a a night spot probably well uh they they said that i it was suspicious behavior and i looked at you know the highway patrol and i said how could it be suspicious behavior of me uh waiting to a light was green making a left hand turn in the correct lane what's to make you know and they had they went all through my car yeah and you know while the highway patrolman pulled me back there or and and i i think they gave me a ticket for driving without my license they did search your car though they did yeah without my permission oh huh so i i thought i'd i was really offended by that i thought that was a severe invasion of privacy yeah and i think some of the laws that they're trying to pass right now um especially in North Carolina uh i mean we  what kind of car would you like to buy next well i guess Cadillac i guess that's kind of everybody's dream huh why would that be a oh i guess it's a General Motors product and i like General Motors because they're made in the United States and uh we've had General Motors for years and have always had real good luck with them okay well that's good if you had uh no financial requirements if you could buy any car in the entire world no matter what it cost what would you buy um-hum oh um i think i'd still go with a Cadillac i don't i don't care about a big fancy fancy say what which type of Cadillac uh is your favorite oh i don't know i guess the Seville probably or yeah yeah the Seville that's a sharp looking car that really is it it always has been though yeah they have been you know it doesn't have the Coup de Ville or the Sedan de Ville squareness it never really has it's always had it's own unique look uh-huh yeah i've always liked that i liked the the one year they had or the couple of years they had were uh the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it oh yeah right i thought now that looks sharp that looks real sharp yeah well i think the ones uh now with all of the um fancy gold lettering and all you know i think they're very pretty um-hum and course the top now the vinyl what is it a vinyl top i think those are pretty yeah and uh the i i've never really uh i've never ridden in one recently um but they're supposed to be just real smooth uh-huh just a nice comfortable ride yeah they are and uh they they're just always they they look like they're sturdy you know they look like they're very sturdy and uh-huh you don't have to worry that much about um getting you know hurt like you would in a small one right now they've got a uh a unique feature uh feature in them now if uh if you have a front end accident at such a rate of speed the engine the engine will actually drop out of the car so that it doesn't come through the so it does not go it doesn't go through the you know into the inside it'll go underneath the car instead oh i didn't know that so that's that's a big safety factor they've got in them now yeah and i suppose they all have the balloons the air bags yep the air bags yeah well so though that's great that's great so you say you've you've always uh preferred General Motors products what uh yeah yeah yeah i do um i i go for things you know built in the United States rather than foreign countries help our economy and right what kind of uh General Motors cars have you had in the past mostly Oldsmobiles Oldsmobiles those are real nice riding cars too yeah oh yeah that's what i have now but of course if i had my choice i'd still have the Cadillac but um i've been very satisfied with the with the Oldsmobiles we've driven them for about probably twenty years has that been the Cutlass or the Sierra uh no the Ninety Eight the Ninety Eight okay um-hum yeah so well i don't think uh let's see the Ninety Eight now that's got that big V eight engine in it doesn't it doesn't it well no now the one we have has a six uh-huh but it's a very good car it's uh has a little V six okay a have not had one minute's problem with it and i've had and i have twenty three thousand miles on it it oh that's great that's great that's always nice to get uh reliability yeah in a product especially when you're spending you know anywhere from fifteen to twenty five thousand dollars for for a single item right you know you just don't want any hassles with it you just you expect it to do its its job and i think a lot of no a lot of car manufacturers don't really keep that into consideration don't take that into consideration you know um-hum there that's true they just expect you to buy their product but that's always been something that's been a key factor in me is how reliable is this car gonna be you know price is is an issue but it's not the most important issue um-hum no it really isn't because now you can get like five year financing on them and so um but i i i would go with the General Motors any time right uh well i've always been a Ford man myself oh really oh yes but that's all right you know it's it's American made too which is good um but i i've ever since i guess i was i was growing up my dad's always had Fords yeah well sure right uh-huh and uh well i grew up in South Dakota so everybody has a truck uh-huh and uh my Ford trucks have just i've i've just never had problems with them i honestly think i would die before my truck would kill over on me uh-huh yeah well uh Ford yeah those are good products also um so doesn't seem like  okay uh i guess uh you have any uh favorite foods well i like to eat um i like to bake a lot i'm not a gourmet cook but um just enjoy a lot of old-fashioned cooking um-hum yeah i i used we used to get the uh magazine Gourmet and uh stuff like that uh i i did try um-hum a few of the the recipes in there and well how did those those turn out uh well i made a a um a bread pudding uh fancy style and it came out really good um-hum well that sounds good my son takes the Gourmet um or the Bon Appetite yeah uh a magazine and he has prepared several dishes uh and they've turned out really well one of those is uh was i don't even i don't even know what the name of the recipe is to this point but um it was just beef cooked with a a lot of wine and and uh all kinds of spices the rosemary and those kind of things and it turned out really really well um-hum i see yeah i i do a lot of i did i've done some uh you know things like chicken and and stuff in there but i i deviate from it i i never like to follow sometimes if there's something uh in there that i i don't like i'll substitute it with something else and um-hum and so uh i like to experiment well well i do too uh in fact uh lot of times i will just uh decide on a a meat and then just put some things around it add some gravies or or um uh sauces and um-hum the the thing i've found that's bad about that if i don't write it down while i'm being creative and it turns out wonderfully a lot of times the next time i think about it i don't have that recipe in mind i can't exactly remember exactly how i fixed it yeah so i've learned that when i am creative like that that i try and make sure i write that down um-hum um one of the things that i have had a lot of fun doing is collecting recipes uh well not really a i don't have lots but i have collected a few recipes from restaurants and uh we have um i don't know what part of the country you're from in but i'm in Dallas i'm in the northern area up here in Wisconsin Minnesota okay well i'm in Dallas Texas and um here for years and years we've had a waffle shop downtown it's closed now but they had famous waffles and i happen to have that recipe right in front of me which is really um doesn't look like a heart healthy recipe at all but it's delicious if you're into waffles yeah uh well i i like waffles but i usually go to restaurant and eat them um-hum um-hum i uh i don't even have a waffle iron well you need one of those for sure but it has um like milk and it has half half-and-half in it yeah and uh course real butter and i like all those things that aren't good for you the me too me too and i'm beginning to show it too yeah i uh i mean we we do use a lot of the the margarines and that but i do miss actual butter um-hum i don't uh use butter unless i do some special things uh usually around the holidays huh and i tend to um feel like i can justify use the use of butter during that time uh not only just you know to put into the recipes but to serve on the table too yeah well i i know it's something that my wife picked up was uh we uh made some um butter from uh you just take heavy whipping cream um-hum and you keep churning it until it turns to butter so well i've done that a couple of times not on purpose yeah i did that by accident a couple of times one of the things that i think i'm going to try this um uh this year for Thanksgiving is i um i've talked to a a gentleman who prepares turkeys by deep frying them have you heard of that no he deep fries the turkeys whole in a peanut oil and he says that um and i haven't tasted them um but he claims that they are juicy and just very very good um he prepares he can prepare up to a thirty two pound turkey uh with the method that that he uses which is just a big vat with you know lots and lots of the the peanut oil um-hum yeah so i think that i think that's um  uh well i i kind of feel like we pay um um maybe uh little uh too much actually i mean like twenty five thirty percent of our income the average family you know uh-huh yes absolutely and it just seems uh um and yet you have big corporations that that manage uh just because the way the laws are written not to pay anything at all year after year after year uh-huh uh-huh yeah no i i agree with you there um i've gone to other states where there's no food tax you know some things there aren't taxed at all and i think that that's really nice i think they that's what Texas needed yeah to do also is to discriminate as to uh which should be taxed and what shouldn't be taxed so uh-huh i don't i've never been any place that didn't have it we went from here to North Carolina for a while and and they had a food tax there so i guess i'm just kind of uh-huh oh see we don't they don't tax food here do they no they do they do uh-huh yeah but i have lived in other states in which they don't uh tax uh food uh clothing items personal things like that they do tax yeah yeah and um so that was that was really neat but i guess the way that they get around it though is that there's no quote state income tax but then you pay ten fifteen percent taxes um you know i know they say it's only eight and a quarter or whatever it is but uh but yeah i really think that it's it's way too much no state income tax right yeah yeah uh-huh uh whenever you buy an item especially a large purchase item it it's it's something in which you're you're paying and you've always got to add in that about ten percent tax um-hum uh what do you feel about do you feel like um how do you feel about for what we get back in the way of services and things in the last what in in the way of services for for the money that we pay oh in the money that we pay um yeah well now for the city of Plano um i really like the the things that they offer here yeah i do too um i and i can't say that for for all of Dallas or all of Texas um but for Plano i do i really think that i get my my money's worth they always seem to be ahead of any other um um-hum yeah city and in the things such as uh you know separating out your glass and your paper now and and uh having the great big you know gallon drums uh uh keeping Plano beautiful and and i think that they really do a good job at it too um-hum yeah so yeah yeah well we participate in a lot of the recreational you know we use the recreational facilities um-hum um-hum and uh where we came from in North Carolina i mean it was a nice area but we didn't have any the mean the the recreational recreational facilities they have here are just unbelievable so i think that we get a good deal in the way that goes right um-hum um-hum well and i think you get spoiled and you expect it whenever you go to any place else and it's just not quite up to standard or par and it's just like oh gee whiz you know it makes you really appreciate i think uh you know that your city and uh what it has to offer now as for the state you know i uh uh you know i guess the the highways outside of what metropolitan Dallas and Houston are okay um-hum i don't know i haven't i haven't been much i haven't been much outside well yeah i used to travel when i was here and they seem to be okay yeah and the outside i mean the your state highways i i think you know are are pretty adequate uh adequate but gosh you get into the cities and you might as well forget it um yeah uh-huh yeah yeah now we lived in Houston for a while in the and in in the city was pretty pretty pretty rough in places uh-huh right right yeah so um i i don't know i'm uh i'm really glad that they didn't go to the um the the state income tax um i'm hoping the lottery is going to uh take care of it uh i know there's a lot of religious issues and et cetera yeah yeah um but i i'm hoping that uh in a way people can can see that as a contribution then to the state um i did live in Ohio for a couple of years and i know that's how they kind of got around um you know having to uh taxes or increase in taxes was was by the lottery is that right yeah yeah yeah and and i know the people are concerned that it's only gonna be the the lower you know income people who are actually going to you know be the the biggest participants in this um yeah so some of those folks probably say you're taxing them anyway then if you're dangling a lottery out there in front of them yeah right yeah yeah absolutely absolutely and um i only saw it as being you know really positive and of course it you know was just a fluke if you won hum you know because i really never expected to win and and i never did the big big lottery we're talking about uh but you know every once in a while i'd come up with two or three dollars or something but yeah uh-huh i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing uh-huh yeah how do you feel about um federal services and things you you know i was yeah what are what are the federal services what what do we i mean i know we got a big army and and you know uh i guess i guess they have matching federal funds for a lot of our state and local projects right well because i was looking at some of the services that i actually use now i did um uh way back when i did use government um things such as uh uh food stamp  okay we're on uh recycling and uh yes i am not real well informed on exactly what Richardson does i know that we uh um-hum they ask us to bundle our newspapers and we do that and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff i see but now Plano has quite an elaborate system don't they yeah they do uh it started out several years ago when they put these uh collection sites um-hum they uh near a Wal-Mart near a the football stadium and the like and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up these huge dumpsters were being filled up in a in a matter of a week so they knew that there was something going on here so they started looking into programs and what we have now it they changed the whole way that they do garbage in Plano instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week um-hum they make a collection on Monday for yard waste and the yard waste has to be put in the special bag that's a decomposable paper sack uh-huh it's a pretty good size it's maybe the size of two or three um grocery bags oh and we put that out by the street and they collect those on Monday and then on Wednesday we put out two containers that they gave us one container's a huge green monstrous thing that a uh a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck so and that's where you put your regular um garbage and trash okay and then also that same day you put out a small tub uh it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide and you put just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper and then they okay and then they recycle they separate it exactly they have a big truck that has like ten uh not ten maybe five big doors on the side of it they throw the different stuff in the different doors oh that's a neat system yeah it is and apparently it's you know it it went off pretty much without a hitch the trucks the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the Persian Gulf war oh uh-huh that the the trucks were being the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other but it it does work pretty well well i know our son and daughter-in-law live in Plano and i know they have commented on the system i don't know that they know that it worked that way but they have the two separate containers and stuff oh yes uh-huh i noticed something interesting the last time i guess two Wednesdays ago when they were picking up i happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up the that tub stuff and the man who was doing the separating when he was done emptying the tub he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub so they must be collecting information about who does it and how often oh that is interesting does i wonder if that means that if you don't do it yeah um-hum you suppose they will come and knock on your door and i i don't know but i think that's a really interesting question that that is interesting you know will you be penalized if you don't will you you know uh yeah that that seems far-fetched only because it it it there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper or pop cans or milk jugs so there there's it's possible that there is a person in Plano that doesn't buy any of those three things right right and therefore wouldn't have that's true except that it's hard to match and you know when you have uh cans you know from the the market and uh you know vegetable cans and et cetera and right no they won't take vegetable cans just just the aluminum pop cans oh they don't take vegetable cans this is just their aluminum cans well then yes it is possible that's interesting i wonder uh yeah huh yeah what they're doing with that wouldn't you really like to know i would someday i'm sure we'll find out i'm sure you know if nothing else call the sanitation department say okay what are you doing reading you know yeah um-hum so tell me what your feelings on recycling is it do you think this is a good thing or silly i think it's a very good thing i think that uh i think it helps that the city is giving you a nudge to do it because i think there are a lot of people that don't do it and i can't say that my husband and i are real real conscientious we got started on the aluminum cans because our uh yes grandson was collecting them uh to raise money and uh stuff for an organization he was in so we started collecting them and now he's through so we've we've just we've kept on huh yes yeah and it's interesting too that we have to drive we drive to Plano up Plano Road to uh just inside your city limits to you know turn them in to dump them in i sure there's bound to be some here in Richardson but we just haven't really seen them advertised or you know something and dump them off yeah and that is interesting right yeah well the Plano yeah the Plano newspaper each each day in fact has a a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things they publish it every single day well that's interesting yeah and phone numbers and and that kind of stuff um-hum well i haven't noticed uh i haven't noticed Richardson you know making that big a deal  well what do you think well um gosh it set up on a scale one to ten yeah one being total control total uh restriction and ten being none well i'm probably dead in the middle uh you know i i think i would too i think i'd straddle the fence because my husband's a truck driver okay uh-huh and he travels a lot of states and i'm always thinking of New York and all of them now they get New York and California's got New York and Washington should i say uh-huh uh-huh got the strictest gun control law there is supposed to be uh-huh and it look what it done it's it's nothing the people more people get killed in New York than than anywhere from guns uh-huh yeah well so the only people the only thing that i think gun control does to me is it keeps the normal people or should i say law-abiding citizens from having guns because the criminals going to get their guns right right yeah it's not going to do any good to now if they ban like the automatic guns and all that from uh-huh period then you know then if they catch them with one then fine but just gun control ain't going to stop them from having a gun right yeah then then that you know oh well see i agree with you uh it seems like the the crime rate has gone up even more um here this year they're talking about uh there're more murders in Dallas um almost uh since last year and yeah well the guy that broke in the store stole a bunch of guns and because the owner didn't have a a burglar alarm or something and that that to me that was stupid they should at least make him have um-hum uh-huh an alarm or make it a requirement on them on them gun stores uh-huh you would think but they oh yeah oh yeah so yeah but i i just i wouldn't want to ban it completely um but uh somehow there needs to be the one thing that i did like was that where you had to wait seven days um you know um well no um-hum well i don't mind waiting that's that that i could care less yeah yeah you know waiting waiting seven days so that they can make sure that check it out and everything's okay and to me that was uh that was perfectly acceptable you know but um-hum you know because if you are a law-abiding citizen you're not going to want to you know it's not going to matter to you if you have to wait a little while hum-um and see the the the thing about it to me that they was talking about having gun control so people wouldn't kill anybody but i am a true believer that if somebody wants to kill somebody okay um-hum i don't care if they can't get a gun they'll find something else oh yeah oh yeah it doesn't matter that they the only thing is is the gun is the quickest way they they had or they had accessible to um-hum um-hum but if they don't have a gun they'll find something else especially if they want or they'll wait on their seven days because they're not crazy oh yeah uh-huh oh yeah yet i mean you know they haven't proved to nobody that they're crazy or they're in no federal no no no uh yeah uh what do you call it record or nothing so they'll get a gun then they can go kill somebody and then that'd be it yeah oh i agree with you yeah um and then they still going to get it so i don't think the gun control is going to help as far as you know just taking everybody's gun away because Japan well is it Japan one of those those foreign countries has gun control but all the mob people have guns uh-huh oh yeah yeah no i i don't think that they should ban it i really i really don't um you know i i don't have a gun in the house myself because i have uh children and uh you know feel really uncomfortable about that but if i was by myself i'd definitely have a gun well i have a gun you know my well my son's fifteen but uh-huh uh-huh my husband and me he knows that he don't even touch it and it's not a hand gun see uh-huh uh-huh it's a shotgun so it just sits there and it's in it's in my bedroom and he's not allowed in there anyway so oh okay uh-huh yeah so that's that's a great but it's not nothing that he can like and that's another thing with these kids with these guns i blame more the parents oh yeah because i grew up with guns i guess you know in the house my father had a gun cabinet uh-huh uh-huh but we wasn't allowed to touch it and Lord help us if we did oh yeah yeah but see these people i know they keep them up underneath their pillows and you know sitting right on top of their dresser drawers i mean it's no wonder you know the kids get in there and then they blow uh other people away so you know uh-huh no yeah little kids in the house and i don't like that i don't like it when they have kids little small kids um-hum because uh when i have small kids over i close my door oh yeah oh yeah and my house is i live i live in an apartment so you know if the door opens i can see like what are you going into my room for it's not like a big house to where's i can't see if they go in my room um-hum oh yeah yeah yeah uh-huh um-hum um-hum i'll know if they go in the room because there ain't but two bedrooms so it's like right there oh yeah yeah so that um yeah but that that's about the biggest reason why i just never never and and i won't even let my my son play with play guns either you know not even get that idea about about them yeah i think the only gun my son has is part of the Intendo you know with the TV thingy that's about it because yeah there you go there you go that's right there you go yeah me too the the you know i don't i don't like that i don't that's that's i don't know i just hum-um but i don't think the gun control as far as i guess i would probably vote right in the middle if if if there is a way to vote uh-huh  okay good morning now do you have any pets i've got three dogs three dogs my goodness what kind of dogs do you have uh-huh um a Heinz Fifty Seven a Golden retriever and a a kind of a Labrador retriever but he's a mutt Heinz Fifty Seven yeah but he i've got a thirty pound one a sixty pound one and a seventy five pound dog my goodness gracious that uh gives you a lot of work doesn't it yes the the first two was planned the last one was an accident uh-huh um-hum do you have any well i my dog uh was just sort of a mixture of two and i can't tell you the kinds anymore died about uh six or eight months ago and uh her name was Gena oh um-hum and she was a very very sweet dog we loved her very very much but the pet that is of great interest that maybe uh you would enjoy hearing about um-hum about um twenty five twenty six years ago my brother-in-law showed up in my front yard pulling a trailer and in this trailer he had a pony uh-huh yes which i didn't know he was bringing and so over the weekend i had to go out and find some wood and and put up some kind of a structure to house that pony because he a stall because he brought the pony to my children uh-huh stall uh-huh and that pony lived with us for about twenty five years and uh the um-hum his name is Sandy and he was a champion jumper in Chicago um-hum it turned out that my brother-in-law's daughter had had a ponies in a at a certain place out there and it caught on fire and they they got out there and got all the ponies out and these people were so happy that they gave her this pony for saving the rest of them um-hum oh and as i say we had Sandy for about twenty six years yeah he has his own little house back there and um two acres of ground to do you still have him no he died about a year ago he was thirty one years old which is very old for a pony they know he was a medium to large size pony ooh yeah yeah how big was he and uh i used to know the different uh breakdown yeah and uh he he was really a nice guy i really can't complain about Sandy hands yes oh i've got a i've got two horses you have two horses well tell me what what what things do you do with those those horses to enjoy them uh yes also they're pets i ride them some and yeah i ride them some but they're they're the they come when you call and oh okay you you ride them uh-huh um-hum and you know nuzzle you and play with you and and uh and just they're pets my goodness you are a busy lady with two ponies and three dogs three dogs no cats i'm yeah i'm afraid the cat would be scared to death i'd i have i have a cat a pony a cat pony i have a cat also whose name is Babe um-hum um-hum and it used to be in the old days i had uh mothers and father cats you know and then we'd have a of six or eight and litters around and so forth and this is the only one that's left from the whole big batch that uh lived through the years when my children were at home uh-huh um-hum now the pony has died the dog has died and the three children have moved out and have their own homes and so my wife and i and Babe are the ones left on the farm now the dogs died and you've and you are you gonna are you gonna get another dog or any more pets we are so busy right now trying to take care of ourselves that uh i don't know how we can handle any other pets right now um-hum yeah if things ever calm down why we'd like to have pets again i i enjoyed uh Gena she was a very sweet dog but i hate to have her she was an outside dog and i hated to have her on a chain all of her life um-hum but that's basically what she had to do we could let her loose and let her run oh for an hour or two every day but we had to make certain she didn't get off the property or get up to the highway and see my three are in in anywhere they wanna be dogs they're they're indoor uh they always sleep indoors um-hum uh-huh well mine mine have always slept outdoors and and well they had their own house dogs are dogs are um at least dogs are um uh pack animals and uh you are their pack um-hum yep they certainly depend on you um-hum but uh my dog Gena as i say she had her own house and she was warm and comfortable in there and yeah other times why she could go in the in the barn with the pony and uh they got along fine so they had their own great big house back there i have several other acres of ground that i normally planted corn yeah uh-huh uh-huh so i have a big enough building back there i had to build this new building to put the pony in the little one i built only lasted about two years and so he had to move into his new castle oh goodness yeah a barn with the hay and everything else in it the feed yes he had the works so i'm sure that uh Sandy had a a good life he was fed twice a day and had his own two acres to roam in and to graze and so forth um  yes um i guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite our total tax burden despite tax cuts but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in in the world and in part of the matter you get what you pay for we're gonna have national health insurance which seems likely it's necessarily gonna involve more taxes uh i suspect they take the view that cutting income tax rates has been good for the the economy that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes uh energy taxes particularly and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes that's the direction we should look right well i guess i kind of have mixed feelings um you know you always sit there and out of each pay check so much comes out of it and you wonder you know where's it all going and we have such a huge uh national deficit and where it's all going and i guess a lot of times there's questions wondering well if it's doing a whole lot of good i know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help but you kind of always wonder well where where's the money going well one one one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax which in principle is going into into a big trust fund but um-hum that is a particularly regressive tax uh it's a tax on the first dollar earnings and Senator Moynihan's uh proposal to to to cut there i think would makes a lot of sense i'm sorry i couldn't i couldn't hear that i think Senator Moynihan's proposal to to cut the social security tax which isn't really going to going to beef up up up the social security program could make a lot of sense right right yeah i agree with that as far as other countries i'm not um i don't keep up on it too much just as far as what you know as what they're doing i know we were in Ireland last year and i know that the tax there is extremely high much higher than we pay here but um-hum oh yes but as far as other countries i'm not uh up to par on i think Japan i think Japan is probably about equal to ours uh-huh and other major countries are higher i had friends were amazed at the sales taxes the classes of things when they went to Canada not so long ago uh-huh and as a whole most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services and it's a real real they're they're real trade-offs there right right yeah but and and you sit there and wonder um i guess this doesn't really have to do with taxes but just money in general and and um wondering if you're gonna have enough when you retire to live on uh i that that's a scary thing with this no no real knowing about uh the the there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans um-hum yeah that's true but um are you involved with the legislature up there or since no i'm at the National Institute of Standards and Technology uh-huh uh they're part of the Commerce Department here in here in in Gaithersburg Maryland uh-huh i was just wondering since you said Washington DC and you and you picked this topic i was just kind of curious well well i i i didn't pick it uh oh you didn't i um i like i don't really recall what i may have filled out on the on the form but i i certainly think certainly been given topics different from the ones that i'd mentioned before oh did you see i haven't placed any calls did they automatically assign the topic yes yes when you place a call topic is given to you oh i didn't know that i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic because i haven't made any calls yet i've just received some oh you should try it oh i didn't realize that okay hm yeah because it's kind of a it can be a rather controversial subject depending on who you're talking to uh many of the subjects are uh and taxes taxes especially um one thing that has kept kept our tax burden high and this will change somewhat in the next few years is the is the level of defense of the defense budget exactly and that's that same subject  hello hello my name is uh Donna Donahue and i'm calling from Plano Texas yes how you doing did you uh press one hi yes i did oh guess we ought to get started i'm Phil okay um let's see um i enjoy watching the Today Show early in the morning with my first cup of coffee because everyone is still sleeping i have three children and i enjoy watching the news because i probably don't have as much time as i'd like to read sit and read the paper um what about yourself i like uh i would like probably like i think i like the Today Show on the rare occasions i get to watch it i uh uh-huh uh first one comes to mind uh without a lot of thought is uh Thirty Something which course is not on the air any more unfortunately it was one of my favorite shows um right i yeah i enjoyed that too i guess too also that was a nice one because it was at a time when the kids are already in bed um i uh yeah and i was gonna say uh I'll Fly Away which uh i think it was supposed to uh catch some of the same viewers as uh uh i haven't had a chance to we've been trying to watch that it's uh not quite as good i guess you got to get into it uh-huh is it isn't it it set in a different era is it um was was it the fifties in the fifties or in in the sixties yeah it's uh it's about uh the civil rights struggle in the fifties okay i didn't i've i've seen the commercials for it but it's not uh seem to be on at a good time for me i try to stay away from horror movies i just dislike them totally totally agree yeah i i don't um uh one well i say violence and horror i just kind of lump them together yeah yeah that's that's that's right and um with young kids in the house we just really try to screen a lot of the things that they they watch um we watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of PBS and the uh Discover channel or Lifetime yeah oh yeah that's fantastic isn't it that Discovery Channel it's yes it is it is it is wonderful and especially my eleven year old is just fascinated by some of the the things they have on there um what else i my husband enjoys watching a lot of sports which i really um don't particularly enjoy but they're they're on you know i tolerate it well i uh i like watching the Oilers and the uh uh-huh that's about it i guess i'll watch that's about the only sports i really like to get into on TV okay and um what else is there's a lot of things that i just can't believe is even on TV you watch it for two minutes and think this is so ridiculously stupid yeah well one of the good things is having cable they uh they uh now uh you know the choices are so so good and so uh variety variety there that you can really you you can change it you know what is a good station too we uh subscribe to the Disney Channel oh yeah i think if my kids were small small again we'd probably would too but uh yeah it's it's a really nice and it they have um you know movies that sometimes we'll sit and enjoy and it's it's really a very nice uh that was we dropped um HBO because there was just never anything appropriate on for the kids and now with renting videos so readily i mean you can just rent it if you really want to see it that badly um-hum yeah but uh it's kind of a toss up there whether the inconvenience of renting the video versus uh there never seemed to be anything good on when we wanna watch it you know that's right and then and then they repeat everything so often too and or if it's on at ten at night well i i'm asleep by ten at night i don't think i could stay up that late any more um not to start a movie anyway yeah yeah well that's true and uh then course they have the Pay-Per-View but our our channel uh system here in Houston is uh is not noted for being the greatest you know i think we kind of got the short end of the stick when uh uh-huh programming came around so i see i see they charge a lot that's four dollars and a half or something like that per per view it seems a little high yeah it that does that does seem high but um what other there's a i guess one or two sitcoms and the kids of course like to watch that new dinosaur show that's uh which is pretty silly but but they oh yeah we used to watch uh when my kids would watch when the teenage kids would watch that uh Bart Simpson that was pretty good yeah yeah once in a while Bryan watch that but that is more for an older kid than than the younger ones yeah they were teenagers huh you know so that that seems okay for them i i like Roseanne that's uh Coach i do too i had to try to tell my kids that you know we don't really talk to each other like that i hope we don't anyway to make sure they don't think well gee mom yeah look what their kid just said said well but um and and the kids like to watch that Doogie Howsner but that even that sometimes i have to shut it off and say and say it's an adult theme we don't need to watch that tonight we'll we'll get out the Clue game or yeah huh-uh or i'll suffer Parcheesi or something with them at least you're exercising a little control  uh Kate what kind of uh where do you like to eat out well we uh we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas and uh so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out yes and so uh Tia's is probably our favorite uh restaurant there and i think they have the one of the best services that uh that we really like it do you have you tried Mother Mesquite's no where's that at that's at Skillman and LBJ there is uh it's where Skillman uh curves into Forest Lane and it's real good Mexican food a another real good one is uh uh-huh um-hum Raphael's down on McKinney Avenue oh they're both very good um-hum really oh that uh no we haven't explored uh you know too many places um you know a lot of the big name brand i guess uh chains uh yeah but um oh we've tried places you know down uh by the Collin Creek Mall the uh you know Alvarez and um gosh we tried what was across the street chains uh-huh El Paso's El Chico's or something yeah something something like that uh-huh uh-huh yeah oh El Chico's or El Phoenix one um-hum um-hum um-hum well i like Tia's better than i do El Chico's or El Phoenix yeah yeah uh much better uh Mother Mesquite's is one of our favorites but then fajitas are one of my uh i like it better than just about anything and they make very good fajitas there in their own uh homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful especially with butter and honey on them oh yes yes oh uh-huh uh-huh oh i know i tell i tell you what they they are they just um they're excellent uh excellent food i wish i could make them here at home yes yes so do i well what else do you like just can't make those flour tortillas but well i love uh i love seafood and i notice they have like the you know The Louisiana Purchase um Razzoo's has opened up down you know off of um um oh close to 635 uh-huh yes now i haven't eaten there have you eaten there yes i have eaten there now the only problem i love the food it's a lot of cajun food and a good seafood but uh the service has always been so strange every time i've been in there mostly it's been at lunch time uh-huh uh-huh and uh but i hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar and um uh that's it's really uh you know kind of lively so it's it's really good all their blackened grilled stuff uh-huh oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like Atchafalaya's out on Beltline in Addison and it's a good restaurant uh-huh oh well that sounds great and fish for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's there in Plano or uh i believe it's a Rusty Scupper over on uh uh Dallas Parkway in Addison which is absolutely wonderful um-hum um-hum huh uh-huh the service is great they have every kind of fish that that you could imagine you'd want and the uh um-hum the atmosphere is wonderful too if you want a really special night out and fish food that's a good place to go uh-huh oh well i uh i have children and and work and so we uh we tend to eat a lot of fast food stuff uh-huh fast food oh i can understand that i can remember when our children were small we lived in the Chicago area at the time and we had a lot of McDonald's when they were first coming out i can't look a McDonald in the face now yeah i know i i know i i'm so sick of McDonald's we we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time and so now we we we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint i know yeah yeah well Taco Bueno's good and cheap and cheap very cheap oh and and cheap too so yeah but but the kids you know they they've got those expensive tastes so uh they like Tia's so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff yes yes yes sounds like my grandchildren yeah i know they they they're just spoiled rotten but uh but no i uh uh we love to eat out of course it's just so much easier and simpler yeah so we uh we usually eat out generally two or three times a week oh yes well it's just my husband and i and it's either TV dinners at home or we go out to eat and i would much rather go out to eat than TV dinners yeah yeah oh oh me too me too so i know uh i i know that i uh you know i just work and i'm just tired when i get home and i i just don't feel like cooking oh no no and uh you know on the weekends there's always things to do and uh so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially i like breakfast out uh-huh uh-huh i like the IHOP there in Plano yeah now i we've been there twice and and both times i just oh the food just didn't quite settle with me and i don't know what it was oh really oh now that's surprising um-hum um-hum because normally they're just they're real good and i like because they they're even if they're crowded they're fast service you know i i don't have to wait forever for a table yes and i love um-hum um-hum yeah and we also like Owens uh oh family restaurant uh-huh country sausage yeah yeah we think it's good now i haven't been there before i went to one i think in Ohio or or or somewhere up there but i've never been to that one here i know it's just down the street so now have you been to Applebee's um-hum it's good yes yes and we like Applebee's yes yes i i really like that too so that was uh yeah it it's fun i like your up there in Plano that uh Country Steak House oh yeah i've been i've been there twice uh-huh yeah so have you tried it we like it because it's fairly reasonable and they have we go for the salad bar salad bar yeah  hello my name is Donna and i'm calling from Plano Texas hi this is Laurie and i'm in Garland oh okay um would you like me to go first sure okay um i have three children um two two who are in regular school uh eleven year old an eight year old and then my little one three year old is in um a University of Gymnastics it's a a preschool and um i think it was really hard to um to pick the right uh uh-huh day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out i guess you can classify them all together um uh-huh some of the qualifications that i look for was that uh you know the cost and um exactly what they did if it was structured or nonstructured if they had a little academic um uh in there and um you know um you know what the qualifications the teachers' were and if the place was clean and um the hours and um um-hum just just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff right well we don't have any children but we're gonna have one next year thanks so um that's something that i'm probably gonna be looking at oh well congratulations right maybe in the future we haven't quite decided if i'm gonna i'm working part time now and i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're gonna do but if we do then or staying home i'm gonna need to find somebody and our our church has a Mother's Day Out program which they started last year and we know a lot of people at the church so i would feel very confident with leaving um-hum um-hum that's a very good place to start i think um-hum yeah the Mother's Day Out programs and that's where Shannon had started in a Mother's Day Out program and um the churches always have i think a uh pretty good program and my child there um-hum you have to make sure that you um that you apply pretty early because they do have a lot of places have very long waiting lists and um and another question to ask is if they're um state certified uh-huh okay um you know if the teachers have um their Master's degree in in child education and um child development um you know what what kind of a structure is is it going to be um uh-huh when your child's a little bit older like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap is there like a mandatory nap time uh-huh time uh-huh what they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going and if and they lay on these little mats and if they fall asleep they kind of let them sleep and a teacher stays with the sleeping ones and the other ones get up and go do something else so uh-huh she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know which is which is nice right um-hum um you know it's kind of scary i guess because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately and so it's um that's true i guess it's such a growing concern but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear right and sometimes when the child's a lot younger before they're really um before three years old you know like the church is a good program and sometimes you even consider um you know having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that right and another consideration is how many infants or children are they what's the ratio of of teachers to to children because that makes a um to children right a difference and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day just your child and or do they just put any child in any crib and you you know you'd want maybe uh-huh your child to have their own sheets all the time and not have another child use that bed you know but i'm sure that um right right whatever you decide you'll be happy with and and it's exciting time to have a new one yeah yeah we're pretty excited to i bet that's that's wonderful yeah that that you know we have been thinking about that but it's a little ways off in the future but um i figure you know i'd probably start asking um-hum asking right around at church because i know that they have a limit as to how old they can be before they you know before you can bring them in some some places um start them as early as i think well some some places take them as infants i guess you know like eight weeks even uh-huh um there's a place to look into um a nurse a friend of mine who's a nurse is was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in on Fifteenth Street up it's in Plano somewhere where um nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants infants and then only up to like two years old and it's it's supposed to be really a um hum you know some places just specialize in just real little ones and then other ones uh are the older children right uh-huh but it is a difficult situation i think and they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry  so so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile um the last movie i saw was Regarding Regarding Henry have you seen that yet no i i saw the previews it's really good i loved it um it's um does does he does it have a happy ending or yeah really good ending um uh-huh um it was just it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time i generally don't get into movies that much but i saw that one and then before that one i saw um oh Naked Gun Two and a Half oh that was funny wasn't it yeah did you have you seen that one yes and and and and the regular Naked Gun and Airport and you know yeah it's exactly like Airplane One and but it was silly yes right so now these are fairly two very different movies one one absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject yeah yeah yeah i i guess i have similarly broad tastes um my most recent um movie that i that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was Henry the Fifth i only only rented it you know maybe a month ago and it's been out for a couple of years but have you seen that um-hum i haven't seen that yet um-hum well it's it's a it's an adaptation of the of the Shakespeare play uh and it is beautifully done um i believe that all the language is is Shakespeare read it except it's been shortened a little bit and there might be a word or two changed right uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie um and i like as you know these these these silly silly movies hm and i also like just some strange strange movies do you do you have any such as well the the one that comes immediately to mind i um is The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover um but there also these various um but David Lynch movies um i got i got hooked on Twin Peaks that made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie i could lay my hands on um-hum oh really i haven't seen any of those oh um well i don't i don't especially recommend i mean you have you have to just sort of like this though you have to like did you see Twin Peaks they're really good huh-uh no no so okay so if you weren't if you weren't drawn to watch that you maybe wouldn't be drawn to these movies either um-hum they're they're just strange yeah are they i mean is it like mystery or oh well it suspense or i think suspense is the right word um and and but but little bit strange and esoteric and um in the case of Twin Peaks a little bit there's some elements of the supernatural in it too oh really that that was the television show hm um there's also a a a producer of of movies in Baltimore called um John Walters who who puts puts out even weirder movies he uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly fairly mainstream like Hairspray um but back in his early days he he he had things um um what are what are the titles i can't remember the titles anymore but but some really weird ones uh with quite a random crew of of characters um it would've made you know these Fellini movies look normal right so do you like um movies a lot see i don't do i don't i i do i do like movies a lot really see i don't do that i don't go to movies that often but just recently i've been to a couple do do you rent them or um no we i just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally but i don't know i just i usually fall asleep or i get bored pretty easily so yes yeah that's what my wife does too um i mean she falls asleep so we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie to to to to to appeal um-hum yeah right that's exactly how well well it was good talking to you yeah it's good to talk to you too take care uh-huh okay bye uh-huh bye-bye  okay what what's your favorite show um hm i like um like shows like um sitcoms i don't like have a favorite i don't watch a lot of TV but i like um um-hum like Full House it's a cute show yeah i like that one too um and like Growing Pains and just the cute little comedy shows i don't think i really have a favorite um yeah uh and the Cosbys i like the Cosbys too oh yeah that's an that's a good show too what else do i watch i watch Fresh Prince don't like that new one the Royal Family uh-huh i like that one with Redd Foxx but then i don't know what they're going to do now oh yeah i don't know because he's gone so wonder what they're going to do about that one uh what is that with Urkel on it my son likes that one oh Family Matters yeah i like that one i guess because they're so they're they're funny um-hum you know i don't get too serious at night if i do i'm i prefer to watch a movie than a series right because then you miss stuff i mean you know where the movie you can watch as many as it i don't know too many sitcoms and oh i guess i like TV but just nice light comedy i guess that's what you call it yeah nothing too serious nothing too bad so right hum-um i don't like a lot of violence oh me neither so the only time i like violence is in an action packed movie oh yeah you know but other than that hum-um now oh and i like The Trials of Rosie O'Near what was that Trials of Rosie O'Neil um with uh oh goodness she played in Cagney and Lacey that woman ah she's a cop or detective or something but that's probably the only one i do like hm i used to watch LA Law and then they went crazy yeah i don't really watch that too often and then i used to watch Knots Landing but they got ridiculous oh i don't know i guess since they took all the bad people off there's really nobody bad on the show yeah yes but we got to have a villain yeah that's true if you're gonna watch a series like that like Dallas and JR you know you can't get rid of Dallas so i mean JR yeah without effecting Dallas yeah i don't know sometimes they try too hard the TV shows yeah and then then it gets like really sick a lot of those stories i used to watch them but i got tired of them because all they do is sleep with everybody's husband that's all the thing is about oh yeah and i don't like that i don't like that idea yeah i used to watch it the General Hospital that soap oh yeah but yeah and i used to watch that when i worked day when i worked nights but and then i started when i works started working nights days i started watching like Dynasty oh yeah you know but can only watch so many of them so yeah that's true there's only so much plot they can give i guess right they try to get um your interest by thinking of something really good but it ends up being really stupid nobody likes it um-hum now my son he likes the Disney Channel oh yeah yeah because it's you know it's got all all nice movies on it anyway or little programs which is good yeah well that's good kids should be watching you know shows like that they don't need to see all this violence there's enough violence in real life you know let alone yeah see that's another thing most of the TV programs now that's all it is yeah is cop movies or something law and i get enough of that watching TV regular news um-hum right i don't need to sit down and be depressed more yep because that's about all it does to me is depress me yeah i could see that probably does that to a lot of people so i don't know it's okay uh different shows what else you like um hm um oh i've you remember i like like the older um shows like they show only on like you you know the weird channels that are hardly ever on um like Happy Days was one of my favorites and the Brady Bunch when i was little i really liked those shows and every Lucy yeah i like Lucy once in a while i'll be flipping through the channels and you'll see a really older rerun or something now Lucy was good did you ever watch Lucy oh yeah now that one i liked Lucy yeah me too yeah the black and white show she's hilarious  back and whether you have the same feelings is that what you understand yes ma'am that's my understanding okay Jerry are you ready to talk about it sure sure thing okay well the kind of enjoy uh dining out i enjoy is where i can have uh real good food and uh it's quiet enough to to talk and go with friends and uh just enjoy you know just a relaxing time how about you um-hum well what i look for in in a good restaurant is a combination of um uh atmosphere and um-hum and um uh tasty food and uh uh competitive price yeah and uh uh in the locate locate where i live is there are several uh good restaurants within a three mile area of our our residence so we we have quite a quite a choice to you know choose from um-hum well that's good and um uh i guess the most the most i look for is uh the the tastiness of of the meal yeah closely followed by the the uh whether the place is clean and and um the the the servers are uh how do i put it uh courteous customer oriented uh yes yes that's gets to be the the catch word now doesn't it because uh-huh well that's they beat on us to be proactive out at out at the office so yeah i understand if i got to everybody else does too right that's right what's good to me is good for you uh-huh well we have this coupon book that uh some friends gave us for Christmas and we also look at the ones that are advertised in there where we can get uh meals that we wouldn't want to go out and spend that kind of money for um-hum at uh a reduced price and uh we found that a lot of the finer restaurants uh are chosen in that uh-huh uh-huh and um i think uh the neatest thing i finally got to go to one i wanted to go to for twenty some years for my birthday my husband made the mistake of asking me where i wanted to go and i told him oh well that's no mistake yeah yeah that's that's just fine uh but see he did that on purpose because i do yeah but he wouldn't he didn't know i was going to he said the dollar signs kind of marched around the page well that's all right he uh you're worth it you're worth every penny of it it was good though yeah well i thought so at the time well i know so my sweetie is worth every every penny of it well good in fact about every other uh anniversary i take her to the uh top of the tower oh yeah but uh-huh the Antares well that Antares the Antares restaurant yeah Antares this one that i went to was Old Warsaw oh yeah i've heard about it but never gone yeah well save it for a special occasion the food is delicious uh-huh the service is impeccable and they're not intrusive huh uh-huh and the music is chamber type music and it um it's background type and then they come around and and play around in the different areas um-hum uh it is expensive but uh you know for every for every special occasions it's great well uh-huh well for for two people what would uh an average meal uh oh goodness um probably depends on if you have wine okay well we don't imbibe so okay so you come out cheaper uh-huh and um i'd i'd say at least put away sixty dollars yeah okay probably more than that if uh everything's priced separately um-hum yes and that particular night i didn't look at the price tags well you're not supposed to on special occasions that's that's not allowed well uh you're supposed to go and uh have a good time yeah and you know let let wisdom be the be the the watchword but don't look at the price you know uh what's well huh you know you have to walk a uh have a balance and things in uh in all things um-hum yeah oh yeah oh yeah you don't do that every time that oh that's true unless unless you have hit uh Ed Ed unless Ed McMahon has delivered to you a a check for ten million dollars oh now if he does that i'll go there at least once a month rogo um another neat place up close to uh the main the TI plant is the uh the Sheraton the Sheraton Hotel across from um oh the center buildings has got a real neato restaurant up on the uh twenty first or twenty second floor oh yeah well i haven't been to that what what kind of food do they serve oh well they have pardon me just general just general type things yeah they have different uh categories you know the steak uh uh fish categories and i think there's some poultry and i'm not not sure what all but uh every last bit of it was delicious and they was um-hum when uh they first brought our food i  okay um do you participate in family reunions i did for years i don't have enough family left to have them uh-huh did you uh were they far away were they close that's well i come from a family that was very large in Bell County uh-huh and and my grandfather came to Bell County on a covered wagon oh how neat and had ten children and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group uh-huh and then sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group you know oh that would be fun yeah it was a lot of fun yeah well we uh we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's uh oh it started probably about forty years ago um because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married and then my husband and i went uh while we were still dating and it's still going on and it used to be held at Lake Brownwood down at Brownwood Texas but now we hold it at uh Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far um-hum and uh we have had as many on a Saturday night it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday and we've had as many on a uh Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty um now we would have group like that in Arkansas we'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred uh-huh yes and we took uh i assume you all brought in food and everything well so many of us came from a long way that we we'd usually at a motel and we bought food there oh uh-huh uh-huh it's i know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in and we go get Kentucky Fried Chicken and bring out and uh but we kind of take our food for three days and uh but um-hum hum now our grandchildren are participating in it and just love that they have all this little batch of cousins that they get to see once a year um-hum um-hum enthused and uh with it and our children you know thoroughly enjoy it so it's been kind of nice it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother now i'm to the mother was and uh i am uh um-hum well um-hum now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter you know participate more um-hum and everything and uh well it's something i really miss because i had twenty seven first cousins oh my word and you know we were very close family but my father's generation was enough older than i my father would be a hundred now oh uh-huh that they're all dead and in fact many of my first cousins are dead oh are they and course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that so we really very rarely all of us get together get together any more and and we're a long way away and and the younger generation the next like my cousin's children i don't know very well you know uh-huh uh-huh but it so it's i doubt that that will come to be again but as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year i think i do think now we have noticed a waning of interest and i think as as parents get older and start dying off i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going well and and folks have gotten so mobile i mean like i have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown um-hum and a brother who has a new marriage and a younger son but my brother and his wife live in Nevada my daughter lives in Colorado one of my nephews lives in New York City one nephew lives in Memphis um-hum and my son lives here but i think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion you know yeah you probably do good just to get your immediate family together yeah and i'm divorced and really only immediate family i have left is my my i have a son and a daughter uh-huh uh-huh but my family's really all dead uh-huh but it was great pleasure while we did it you know oh yeah they're a lot of fun well my sister i have a sister and then we have a son and a daughter and we have three grandchildren and and our son and daughter are both married and uh um-hum our son's not as interested in it as our daughter but our daughter our daughter is really interested and uh did it does it bother you if your children are not interested in it i beg you pardon does it bother you if your children are not interested in it oh a little bit i i wish that our son was you know and um um-hum but uh the cousins are closer to our daughter's age and than to our son's and just totally different interest group and plus and he's just he's newly married and doesn't have children and uh-huh um-hum you know i'm hoping that as they you know are married a little bit longer and have children that they may be more inclined to want to go um-hum you know to it i know that what what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested to talk to them about it well talk to them about it and you know tell them some of the things we're doing now when he was a child uh a young oh preteen you know when he was like ten or twelve he loved going he had another cousin he was close to um-hum and we but that cousin kind of quit going and as he got to be a teenager um he wasn't quite as as interested he was more interested in rock and roll and this is more country western group and uh just lack of interest um-hum  hi my name is Donna and i'm calling calling from Plano Texas i'm Jay in Dallas okay um i um find exercise kind of a task i guess i'd say i go to aerobics two days a week but i also have three kids at home so they keep me pretty busy that keeps plenty of exercise for you yes it gives me plenty of exercise but i enjoy um walking outside and bicycling once in a while with the family excuse me and yourself well i uh i uh have uh i walk and run every um almost every morning i've sort of stopped here with the weather change but uh it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning um-hum every morning well my husband swims every day at lunch which he loves doing and oh that would that's fantastic exercise yeah he does it every day like a ritual once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he um someone invites him to lunch he'll he'll not go but he goes um every every day and then he runs he's a runner too he runs three mornings a week he gets up about five and and does his his deal and some days he doesn't but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run and um we basically hm right i'd rather get a bicycle but i have an i had an exercise bike in the house but uh didn't seem to use it enough so somebody sold it in a garage sale and so uh but i'd like to get a bike and just do outside do biking outside oh the the the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here and i know um uh we we both of my husband and i both do it to just keep the pounds off we're getting up in age i guess in uh our late thirties so we need to keep exercising just to be able to um yeah it keeps going because i'm fifty five and it uh it just gets worse worse you still wanna eat and uh but you just i think you feel better too if you get on some program like that but uh oh i know yeah i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week and i take my three year old with me there's a nursery there and it's kind of another day out for her um-hum to um have little friends and um i i enjoy the socialization of it you know getting to see the same women every morning but um right there're some parts during that exercise that i think i cannot do another second of this oh i know it it it some of it is so tough and uh uh especially when somebody's um planning one for you and they know what what's good for you i think when we do it ourselves we take the easy way sometime it is that's true that's true well okay well yes thank you for participating thank you bye so so anyway thank you for calling and well all right bye-bye  all right i i like keep forgetting to make these calls i've been on this list for two months and i think i've made four calls oh really i just oh i just got mine last week and i haven't started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked right well they do have some kind of nice prizes and it's worth doing and i'm so mad i think i've had this for two months and like i've said i've made four calls and lot of times we don't answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening really yeah well we're supposed to talk about movies have you been to any lately i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already uh i really haven't seen one since probably August because uh every weekend in in the fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after and that's kind of the oh that's your weekend yeah really our social for the but oh i saw uh Robin Hood which i didn't care for really i didn't see that because i didn't think i would care for it no and my husband dragged me to it i like i think Kevin Costner's a nice fellow and he's nice looking but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor oh yeah i think that's why a lot of people go to see him though right right i guess because he is good looking i don't know oh i saw City Slickers did you see that was a that's the last one i saw i think yes i did see that and i really enjoyed that i did too i thought that was so cute and yeah i thought that was appropriate just for everyone yeah that was great oh i do too oh i i really enjoyed that yeah and my daughter went to see that one too so it was fine for her and right which most of them probably aren't i don't know what my kids see any more my kids are twenty and sixteen so they've probably seen about everything at this point so yeah right well that's right probably they have them my daughter is twelve oh and we had a sleep over one night they wanted to watch Pretty Woman which i have and i was hesitant and they all had seen it anyway um-hum oh i know it that's the way it is and they're all twelve so we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on on just regular TV without cable or even you know there's no way to protect them any more yes they do yes they do right but i i love Julia Roberts's movies but i didn't think they were great for my daughter so no right it'll teach a great lesson because she ended up so in so well but it was a fun movie to watch no really really oh i love Pretty Woman and then i like that one after that where oh what was it it was like a Fatal Attraction thing yeah oh the scary one oh yeah i didn't see that Predator i don't remember the name of it but that was so good oh really that was really excellent oh i like scary ones that are realistic yeah that that was that was they say Cape Fear is really frightening too Cape Fear the new one that came out what was oh i don't know they say it's really horrifyingly scary but uh i'd never get my husband to that he doesn't like to be scared really oh the last scary thing i saw was Misery oh and my kids both saw that they liked it i that scared me to death and i watched it at a friend's house on video and i was just oh yes it was horrible it was so awful it was still scary oh my gosh i know that one sounded gross i know my husband wouldn't have stood for that he means he likes Mary Poppins and things yeah really i like that too i like funny movies and i like scary movies i do too i really i really like a variety yeah where you from i'm from New York oh i was gonna say well my husband's from New Jersey and we lived there for five years when we first got married and so it sound kind of nice so was familiar your accent is he really oh yeah yes it's so close because i'm from Long Island so that's close you know that's more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester New York those that kind of thing oh right i don't know they talk up there yeah different it's it's different yeah i guess just uh different um-hum well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently oh really and and his family they lived in the same house there most of them were twenty or so you know really and they were all from New Jersey hum yeah um-hum and they lived you know they never moved into apartments when they were young they always stayed at home until they got married it seemed to be the custom up there or they went in the service and so they were together for all that time really yeah but they still had the accents differed a little in the family huh so and it when did you live there uh in the sixties i finally i finally oh yeah well i was in New York in the sixties yeah oh really i converted him to being a Texan i i just thought life would be i knew it was easier back here are you from Texas well sort of i'm an Air Force brat but i was real familiar with Texas i went to college here and everything oh yeah oh yeah and i just thought you know we could probably get a better house and life is a little slower a little easier and he loves it he he really would never want to leave so it worked out it is it is yeah i'm used to it now so i like probably hard when you first came hum was it hard when you first came oh yes it was because we're here eighteen years oh my and you can imagine what Plano was like eighteen years ago oh i know oh compared to New York oh yes it was very difficult yeah it was very very difficult i didn't even want to talk you all transferred yeah um yeah so i have a friend down the street's from New Jersey and they were he got a  well what kind of car uh are you thinking of buying next uh more than likely it's going to be a Chrysler you like the Chrysler products do you uh Chrysler LeBaron yeah it it won't be a Ford i've got a Ford Mustang now and i hate it do you really what year is it yeah it's a eighty eight and why don't you like the Mustang it's um i've had one problem with it after the other the the the paint the paint's peeling off of it and there's no reason for it you know and i'll be darned well you know the old sayings about Fords what they stand for fix or repair daily or find on read road dead there you go that uh i it's it's my electrical system shorted out like two or three times and it's been torn up since April and i and well uh luckily everything was under warranty so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed it would have been like two thousand well we've always uh we've always had Oldsmobiles and uh been very uh happy with Oldsmobiles but uh my wife thought she wanted to get a Ford Mustang and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those uh Mitsubishi Eclipses she really those those are nice cars she likes uh likes those uh she has a sister that lives in uh Phoenix that has one and uh really uh enjoys it well what uh what things do you consider when you buy a car um the gas mileage for one thing and i've uh i've always had like stick shifts i want this next car i want to get i want it to be automatic i see because i'm i'm i hate driving anyway and then and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now yeah well especially when you're in high traffic areas and have to mess with that all the time yeah and you know when you work nine to five or eight to five and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work unfortunately that makes it very frustrating and i look ah and that one of the things with Chrysler right now is is their the warranties that they have and i've i feel like there's everybody everybody i've talked to that owns one is is is is been real pleased with it hm i like those uh those driver's air bag i like that now this is a LeBaron uh yeah well all Chrysler products has it in there but i is a Chrysler LeBaron would be the next car i get yeah i sure like the uh convertible those ragtop LeBarons they really look sporty yeah yeah i like i like that too huh but i couldn't i couldn't afford the insurance on one of those well uh we always this last Oldsmobile we bought uh it's an eighty seven but we bought it in eighty eight you know right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them yeah and uh we found that uh we found a real good interest rate you know when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that they really come down on their prices and uh um you know we looked around at used cars and we really couldn't uh afford the payments on a used car because uh if you go to the bank and try to get a loan they want to charge twelve thirteen percent you know and we ended up i think with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car and our payments well that's that's what i'm paying on mine now i i had to get like a first time my dad's always co-signed on on my my loans or whatever and this is one i've that whenever i got my Mustang this time was by myself because i was out my own or whatever and um i had said that they they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever and they're charging me unreasonable about interest but i've got eight more payments and it's paid for well that's great but i got it when i got it when the eighty eights first came out so it's it's it's a good car i mean i got in eighty seven i guess in like November or something like that uh-huh well when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door our first car was an Oldsmobile back in seventy seven it was a two door Cutlass Supreme and um it just happened that when we looked for our our new car they had a thing going with Oldsmobile and if you'd buy a a new Oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred dollar rebate because it was their seventy fifth anniversary uh-huh i believe it yeah seventy fifth anniversary so in addition to everything else we got off the car all we had to do is show them our uh papers on our first car and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it so we we got a four door this time and i sort of went more for the uh the comfort factor and uh i like the smaller cars but i'm a bigger person and i i really like comfort you know driving along the road and stuff well that's another big factor of mine next next car i get's gonna be a a four door too something with some room yep because i my Mustang's a is is two door with bucket seats and when you buy groceries and stuff like that and if you try to take anybody uh you know go to the show or go out for supper and you go as a foursome  okay on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why well i guess i stand on uh on probably ten for no uh restrictions i uh recently just moved to Texas from uh South Dakota and Nebraska and i guess in terms of gun control i've always uh been raised with the uh idea in the Constitution that uh citizens had a right to bear arms and i realize that probably way back when when the Constitution was written it probably regarded uh more uh of a national defense uh than anything else but uh on the other hand too uh people then uh needed to use firearms for um survival in terms of uh food and uh i was raised uh yes true you know hunting all the time i lived on the farm and and um you know enjoy hunting and i guess i have uh some problems with uh being restricted to um owning a gun for you know hunting purposes mainly right and um it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where um eventually we may not be able to have that right any more yeah i can i can understand that i was raised in Oklahoma and course being Oklahoman and Texan uh you know hunting the hunting and everything and i'm used to relatives and my father and my husband having guns and all and i i did used to be all in favor of it but it's all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun no crooks nothing but because i know that's not gonna happen then i have to i'm probably right up there about an eight yeah it uh moving to this area of course it happens everywhere but um i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns uh in the midwest and then uh moving to a larger city where there are drive-by shootings and uh there seems like killing for no reason at all and uh well it it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was there's always been a certain amount of crime in your you know your urban areas and i know we lived in Chicago for seven years and of course it was definitely there so when we first moved here it wasn't as bad as this it's you know it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the uh drug kings that are here and and uh Jamaican drug kings coming in i don't know whether that's it or street gangs i don't know what the answer is i know that it's scary and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do and that's basically what the gun control would end up being i i think so and and there's always the uh the old uh saying that keeps coming up that if a person wants a gun bad enough they'll they'll get one and uh and then uh yeah well it's very true it's not the law-abiding citizen that you know is is dangerous with the gun it's the ones that are going out and stealing it and i said i think the only way i would be yep in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them and i think that would almost have to go with armies too i mean that has to be almost worldwide which we know would never ever happen yeah yeah that's for sure because even if you said okay you know armed forces could have them some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck yeah and uh and uh and you know uh i suppose um years ago way back when uh when uh they had the Revolutionary War and people decided that they uh were fed up with the government uh if they didn't have a way to uh to fight back they would have been in big trouble that's that's very true very true who knows we maybe want to overthrow the government i know if somebody doesn't do something uh well the way things are going what about uh what do you think of this this uh law that they're putting into effect that you have to wait X number of days before you can uh carry the gun or buy you know actually purchase the gun well you know they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager i believe in terms of uh every gun you had bought had to be licensed i believe yes and uh you know that didn't bother me uh too much and so i guess it depends um if there are some statistics that show that uh that people uh commit crimes on the spur of the moment  okay well have you bought anything recently and uh if so do you find it to your liking do you think it's worth the money i bought i haven't returned it but i bought a i went down to San Marcos to the Coach Store and bought a Coach handbag uh-huh and i've had it now for two months and i have owned Coach products before that's why i love them so much and uh i am going to have to take this back to have it repaired after two months i am so peeved oh really yeah i can imagine i i think it's because they're not cheap no they're not not even at twenty five percent off so um i just uh and i've owned many before i'm just really not a bit happy with it i don't know if they've gotten too big or too popular or or what but you expect when you well i know that in going out and and looking at clothes uh even going to expensive stores the clothes look to me so sleazy any more i don't know whether it's the type of materials they're using yes is it you know is it supposed to be you know crepe or what and or if it's a case now i've seen Dillard's in an area um-hum and they hadn't even they'd hung the clothes out but they hadn't even pressed them so they didn't look good to begin with and uh you know and they looked cheap and they were you know they weren't cheap they were hundred and thirty nine hundred hundred and fifty i saw that um-hum you know you don't buy find cheap dresses any more even at Penney's no especially at Penney's they've upgraded considerably exactly and uh the only thing that i know that we have uh uh televisions um-hum we have have gotten real good televisions we have had real good luck with televisions and i just wanna i think that their i think their quality is better but to see you can buy you could you could you pay the same price for a new television as you do for a new suit a man's suit you know well that's true that's true that's true you do you you can buy a portable cheaper than you can buy a man's suit oh you exactly i was uh i had i bought something the other day and i thought well i've been wanting this new whatever and i did this this is my new brand i know what it was i was wanting this new television and this is this is my new TV and it was like three pairs of shoes and a you know and i've gone to the outlet to buy the shoes so so i know well i know that uh our son for Christmas we usually for Christmas we will give him a suit and we try to you know stay around two hundred and something on them we you can't find a suit any more for two hundred and something um-hum huh even even at uh the Men's Warehouse and things like that um-hum um-hum you know i could you know for what some of the suits cost they had just moved into a new house i could buy them a a small new refrigerator almost as cheap as what the suits are exactly and that's utterly ridiculous clothing has just gotten totally out of sight and i hate to spend you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a dress that's made in Taiwan that the you have to pay five dollars to have cleaned every two times you wear it or something and yes yes yes very definitely so uh i just you know i i other than the TV's uh TV's i i do think here are made pretty good uh but i don't think cars are made that well any more hum i am real happy with my car now what is it what car do you a Ford a Ford yeah i i think everything's it's oh four and a half years old and everything works on it and nothing's fallen off or broken i know friends with Chryslers that haven't had that luck and oh that's good Toyotas that haven't had that luck and um-hum but uh no i think i think you're right the electronics seem to be of decent quality um-hum i don't know whether competition is so stiff between Japan and and the US or i don't know what it is but you know the electronics seem to be you know pretty good value for their money and going down in price too yes yes definitely because i know the price of the big screen TV's you know they're going down you know compared to what they were three years ago oh and i bought a little camera about six years ago that i just thought was the the bee's knees or whatever it just i mean just wonderful and now i can get it for fifty dollars less the same model and for the same price i can get one that does a lot more same model um-hum um-hum the only thing i'm not seeing going go down that much is the camcorders the video tape recorders things oh well not a lot no uh uh they've gone down a little bit we just bought one we kept thinking they would get much cheaper you know like somewhere around five or six hundred dollars but they're still right up there around nine eight or nine hundred dollars uh-huh um-hum you know which kind of surprised me because the how long have they been out now almost ten years oh yeah my brother has an old one you know uh-huh and uh so uh they've gotten smaller though and that's true and maybe that's what it is maybe they're just coming you know they're constantly working on them and so therefore they keep changing and they don't have any reason yet to  okay Mike i guess we'll be talking about painting recently any of kind of recent painting you've done uh yourself have you done any recently well we um remodeled a bathroom uh-huh and which required uh completely repainting the bathroom and the other project we've done around here is uh we've remodeled all our all our closets wow wow that's that's quite a chore which required quite a bit of painting yes i imagine it did did you have that done professionally or did you do that yourself no we did it ourselves did it myself you enjoy that yeah oh that's that's fun we just recently uh had our boys' room our two oldest boys share a room and they're uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth and uh looks quite good we were quite pleased with the result is this a project you did yourself yes it's a project uh that i did yes and and uh what what what brought about the fading of the paint just sun exposure well i don't think it's sun exposure but um boys will be boys and there there were crayon marks on there and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean oh okay yeah latex paint latex and so pardon me yes it was it was latex paint and that's uh what we put back on there was a latex paint um-hum plus uh they had bunk beds and the boy one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures on the ceiling so yes on the ceiling and uh you scrub and you scrub but you can't it all off yeah no that's true and so that's one of the reasons why we painted and uh did you go what what kind of paint do you use on the ceiling we used a flat latex paint and in the bedroom as i understand that's uh one of the better type of paints to have because it's not so reflective and and glossy colored okay um-hum and it uh turned out real real well seems like um i've we've done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have um-hum and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints um-hum and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints it seemed like we had a occasion uh where we had to do some sealing uh-huh of uh the ceiling of the this type of paint before we could paint it oh you had to prime it and and seal cover over it yeah right huh you had pretty good luck with one coat type paints you use a particular brand or anything well i like to use this this Sears uh the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee yes weather beater type stuff yeah and the reason being is once i paint it i don't wanna have to go and do it another five or seven years later understand but uh and uh we're quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom um-hum i read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your bathroom bathroom yeah it's a lot like uh wall paper and uh did you have any problems with that or that's true well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath so we didn't have a problem with that oh good um i have had i've uh have never experienced that type of a problem uh-huh uh with a latex paint oh good neither neither have i so you shouldn't have a you shouldn't have a problem with it oh good they're they're pretty well refined today a lot of the paints and Sears is one of the better ones uh-huh yeah you i've used uh many a gallon of them myself do you uh have you ever used an oil base paint uh used oil base paints for trim um-hum you know like around doors and and on doors things like that why why do you use that i'm i'm kind of learning at this new at this but uh primarily because it seems it seems to be a little more um what do i wanna say it adheres better or lasts longer well not so much that it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings oh okay as opposed to uh a latex type paint uh-huh and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though it's the same color right well that's good that's good so it's worked out pretty well for us um have you ever done any painting outside uh quite a bit painted a couple of houses uh recently this summer we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the property  okay what do you think of the public school system first off do you have children that are in it i have children that are in the Plano Public School systems and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school system so oh okay well then you should be a good one to know because i my children are grown now i now have grandchildren in the school system so uh oh i don't have first had experience right now with it so what do you think uh-huh uh-huh well i think the public school systems are doing a good job i think they have a long way to go yet but i think that um they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier you know my kindergartners were on the were on the computers and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done and i think that uh the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them you know skills you know you don't just add one plus one you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think they literally cannot come in out of the rain right that's right you you know and that just i don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted and uh this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education correct so i think you know they're they're trying to head into into teaching them to think and use the education that they have and i think that's very very important yes it is i i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren we have a uh fourth grader and then we have one that's in kindergartner and and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing were doing in the fifth and sixth grade oh yeah you know it's amazing to me and stuff that i didn't do until i was in junior high which of course shows my age oh yeah uh i tutor a girl that's in eighth grade and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two when i was in high school and it's like oh i going to take this home and study it before i can help you that's kind of scary right you know so they're really they're really moving them along but yet at the same time you know they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life and that's what you know a lot of the things that we did in school i've never used and never will use now yes and uh so i think that it's it's appropriate to teach them you know why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this correct are you finding that uh since you're doing substitute that you're wanting to do full-time um i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms yes that's a and and do are you do you find that well filling out the forms and also all of these uh statewide and national wide testing things so that they compare and say you know you can as far as i'm concerned uh-huh you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say um-hum and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it and you waste so much time quote unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be you know that be um-hum i think it's uh i think it's crazy personally you know the first the whole first nine weeks of school is is used as a review but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in October so that you know your school district shines throughout the United States um-hum and i think that's totally useless i think you know there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous it's like bragging on your grandchildren right you know and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to those and that's great but that's what they're doing with the school systems and they're wasting too much time on that i think uh-huh well i i know that this again this this friend uh is in the Plano School District and she teaches uh uh-huh uh it must uh emotionally disturbed children and she says she has some six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade uh-huh yes and she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something i didn't quite understand it yeah there's not yeah the bottom line line is always money and uh  okay let's see um when i was working i would wear um comfortable casual type clothes nothing real dressy but um mostly um i do like to wear shirts that are kind of longer and um uh-huh not real high high shoes i would say more more flats with low heels more more flat kind of shoes and something that would be comfortable to wear throughout the day nothing that would be too dressy well i work in an office so i wear a lot of suits and but my shoes are lower heels i'm not able to wear high heels um-hum and uh i wear but right now it's kind it's real casual in this office because we're getting ready for this holiday and and we're wearing pants and sweaters which is nice that's that's a lot of girls wear jeans but i just i don't approve of that in a office um-hum i felt the same way well i work in a private high school and i always felt like i had to dress i dress casually but yet i dress a little bit oh yeah dressy i dress totally dressy compared to what the kids came in to what the kids looked like you know i had to uh-huh well you're an example for the kids then right so i had this and real conservative my taste runs real conservative i like white blouses with little Peter Pan collars and sweaters and cardigans and turtlenecks and just kind of um just very conservative kind of traditional clothes and nothing nothing at all faddish i don't i get suits or dresses that i have that i had several years that i can pull out of my closet and they will still be in style just as they were when i first bought them um-hum oh that's good that's good uh-huh that's the kind to get you know that kind of stuff yeah kind that's in style for a long time that's the kind i have too yeah and just just um i like a lot of color though too i do too i do too a lot of i like the peaches and the um-hum well i have uh dark hair so i do like to wear the real bright i like bright bright royal blues and bright reds on on on me uh-huh and that's kind of nice especially for the holidays it's fun to dress with all the bright colors right well i have light hair it's a kind of a reddish blonde so i wear the bright blues too and the uh-huh uh-huh uh but i can't wear red red's just too much no too much for you uh-huh huh okay um-hum but i like the peaches and the greens and the blues and and uh and um let's see what was the question did we supposed to come the seasons the colors in the seasons there's okay i like the darker colors in the fall the browns and the yes now browns i stay away from browns because i have dark eyes and dark hair so for for me oh okay well see i wear a lot of those i like a lot of brown a lot of those who look pretty shirt um-hum uh-huh that that i have a a little three year old that has very blonde hair and i dress her with different colors that i never get to wear like the bright the bright um she looks really pretty in yellow just like a real bright lemon yellow and um certain colors like that and she um um-hum i'll put on her and they look real cute um that's it well uh-huh yeah well i like a lot of nice i wear a lot of nice clothes too of course they are expensive it takes money to dress nice now well that's the that's the problem i think it's you know the way you would like to dress and the way you could afford to dress is two different well when you work yeah when you work a lot of your money goes to your clothes because you're trying to look nice like everybody else in the office yes that's right i found that even just working part-time in this uh private school last year um it was it it was an expense just to get started to get the clothes after being home with the kids and like i said it was real important because i was working around teenagers and i like you said had to set an example and i that's right that's right well wouldn't have felt comfortable wearing jeans although some of the teachers did once in a while that i don't i very rarely even just wear jeans at home you know i'm not comfortable in them yeah well now you could have mixed and matched them did you do that with different skirts and blouses and yes to make different outfits uh-huh yes that that is a big consideration if i have a a solid navy blue blazer i might you know go ahead and pick up a plaid skirt or something and then maybe a solid whatever to mix and match that yeah you can make um-hum i sit there and really kind of i really have to take a long time to think about what to to get because like you said you have to can make your wardrobe larger that way by right to make it right and also adding some accessories to different different things i'm not a real um i don't like to wear really big earrings i kind of have a few gold earrings that are my favorites and just little pearls so i'm really kind of boring in a sense conservative well now the the scarves i didn't really go for the scarves did you no they once in a while i'd i'd try one on and it would seem right and then before i walked walked out the door i'd have it off because it just didn't feel right yeah i just didn't go for the scarves i don't know i didn't um i didn't like that too much either i knew some women that they in fact they still  push my number okay okay so are you a a a golfer or are you a spectator oh i'm a i play golf but i don't actually play golf well i'm the same way i i go out there and hit the ball yeah hack it all over the place it's sickening isn't it yeah um uh well in the Carolina's it's it's just you know we've got a bunch of golf courses around here yeah we've got tons up here but i don't know how do you feel about your game i guess that's a good question uh well i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all uh uh a friend of mine goes golfing a lot and he drags me out every now and then and i uh i don't have a i don't really even have a game i usually when i go out and play golf it's usually like at a at one of these par threes that you know you yeah but um i like watching it on TV yeah i like that too i don't know i try to play but God i a couple years ago i played two three times a week and got lousy i guess that's the best i ever got was lousy uh and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come and then i got worse again so well i i i if i can i can hit a great deal like um uh they they my friends to get me they they say i hit worm burners because i i can't hit it up in the air so i'm pretty bad but i i i get great distance hitting it you know uh for it going across the ground yeah and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm but i'm getting better i've got where now i can hit it in in the air some of the time um-hum that's pretty good yeah uh so i'm kind of a novice at it um i'm that at worse i i play next year i actually i take it kind of seriously but i've been doing so bad next year i always say this every year but next year i'm starting over from scratch i'm going to go take lessons and everything i'm going to do it right and see if i can actually play this game or not well that i i guess that's what i need to do is is get some kind of lessons or something because i my my tee off is not bad i mean i'm i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that it's just that that initial tee yeah what do you do when you're putting that's a good thing that's something i could learn actually that's when i do my worst i finally get to the green and i think i'm doing all all fine and then just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really you know checking the ground and and so forth you know see how it's going to break or whatever yeah can you really see it though what about the speed yeah if you get if you get down on the ground you really can can you tell how nah but can you tell how how fast you're going to hit it um well if you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's it's you know because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction yeah but you can feel that yeah i don't know i have i can get get it within like you know four or five feet or something but i don't have enough field now i'm TV watching they make you die at the hole every time oh it just dies and rolls in yeah yeah i don't know it's hard for me but i the the it's it's like i said once i get up on the green i'm fine but that that tee shot uh it you know when teeing off uh it i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground so it it takes me awhile to get to the hole but once you're there you're all set though i'm all set we should play team golf then i'll get us there and you put it in that sounds good to me that it's uh i see oh the TV golfers they do that it takes them two to get there and two to get it in so it's fifty percent and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in well it it it usually takes me about probably two to to or three to get it there and and then that's according to the hole and it just uh uh maybe one or two putts it's according to where i'm at on the green yeah that's good but the friends i play with uh they play all the time and and they're really good Joe Pros uh they're not Joe Pros but they they golf in the high sixties low seventies so i guess they're pretty good that's pretty good for eighteen yeah for eighteen wow that's pretty good yeah i'm talking to the wrong guy your shitty golf is probably the best golf i've ever seen no no no that's not my golf that's my friends mine mine i'm i'm usually in the eighties or nineties so i'm i'm not good if when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good i'm usually around a hundred that's my thing around a hundred you know i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole but it ain't going to happen well i either teeing off i either slice it or i hook it ever single time and and i alternate well it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time that's good i aim  last the last time i had one of these conversations i you know discovered that i my tastes and and and the other persons were very different uh oh well that's good uh i my my own uh so where do you like to dine out um well sort of yuppie places i guess is probably the best way to describe them um places that are comfortable and have sort of unusual different foods oh i see well i like the atmosphere myself um where where what do you find particularly good atmospherewise well i like i like let's see well it depends on the mood i'm in also sometimes i like to go where there's quiet music and there's a piano bar and so that we can visit or there's um-hum um-hum other times when i like when there's real exciting and there's one place here in Dallas where there's a woman on a trapeze and she she goes back and forth over the bar well that sounds different i'd seen things like that in movies but it don't recall having ever been to a restaurant ever even close to a restaurant where that was an option oh well that's that's called Old San Francisco Steak House hm and she uh swings back and forth over the bar it's very interesting oh uh the she tries the ceiling is i don't know how high it is but she touches the ceiling with her toes and then her yes yes yeah that's kind of interesting that that sure is now can i top that can i even come close gee but uh so you like different foods huh sure enough um what kind what kind uh what this week it's been Chinese food five days in a row so oh gee um but normally not so not so not so concentrated um um southwestern cuisine um you know New York deli kinds of stuff uh you know it covers covers you know quite a range i mean the the only things i find difficulty with is is these these raw fish things um-hum um-hum um-hum oh yes i can't eat that either i do like fish though we have a lot of Red Lobsters out here uh how do you have Red Lobsters in Texas in the middle of Texas i eat there quite often how do we have them yeah i would have thought they would've come out of out of the water somewhere they're all over crawling around on the on the no no i mean the Red Lobster that's the name of the restaurant around Dallas oh oh oh i'm sorry oh i'm sorry i thought you were talking about a kind of food like Red Lobster yes them the Red chain yes thank you never mind i'm talking about the restaurant what makes you go back to the same place is it the food or well it's it's um it's a combination of a lot of things i mean there's sort of a value quotient i mean i i you know there's no absolute dollar limit that you know is either okay or not okay but it's it's more like gee this is a really good you know you got a lot for your money either quantity or quality or interest or oh and the service too and service and um right the service means a lot to me yes um a lot do you prefer to have men men or womens as servers i really prefer a man um-hum why is that i just i feel that they're more efficient and they they just seems like they just have it uh more together you go to Mexico and you won't see any women servers yes all men servers down there yeah i've never been to Mexico what how how how are the how is the food in Mexico compared to what we find in oh Mexican restaurants well oh how's the food different there than up here yeah compared to what we have in this country well it's much spicier um-hum and it's um it's just prepared a little bit different but it's uh it has a different flavor to it and the service is good because the because they have men servers um-hum and uh what do you like men waiters or women i i i think i probably have a slight preference for for male servers but but not very great um um you know it's the the quality of service is is important and it and it's and it's i don't think that that's i don't correlate that with genders um i think i think it really it might actually just be that you know some some restaurants employ more of one than another it may just be the restaurants i go to um-hum well i just i feel like the men have it more together than the women they just i've waited on tables myself and i just could never seem to organized like the guys were how how did you like being a waiter or waitress it's a lot of hard work that's that's what my impression is a lot of hard work and and and being a chauffeur that isn't also hard work a chauffeur yeah really hard to please people yeah just like waiting on tables you just can't whatever you do sometimes you just can't please them yeah is this is this one of these limo services where people coming into town and want to be driven around and um-hum  camping um i've been to several different kinds of camping when i i've been to a girls camp where we slept you know in tents and there were a bunch of girls and cooked over the fire and i've also uh been camping in a camper trailer or or on a uh with a truck and a and a camper um when i was younger i really enjoyed going in the in the the trailer i didn't realize until i was older how much how much work there was involved for the for the parents of the camping um are you have what kind of camping have you participated in uh i'm a boy scout leader so we we go camping every month oh you know just you know tent camping of i never really camped in you know in a motor home or a trailer oh it's always been in a tent so when you go do you go to to designated camping sites or just up in the mountains or just no no the the the boy scouts have their own you know ranches well no mountains there uh-huh that they own and they've got park rangers that run them oh and that you know they've got campsites set up and latrines and water and all for the boys oh so you you don't really have to rough it too bad huh no we we bring our own cooking gear you know the the boys split them up in patrols and they cook their own food and stuff uh-huh oh do you do you cook over an open fire or do you have the little camp stoves uh we we usually cook over an open fire we've we've got camp stoves in you know in case it's if wood is too wet or something but uh-huh oh have you ever done Dutch oven cooking while you're camping yeah uh yes we we've cooked stews and cobblers and biscuits and oh in fact every every time i go i end up having to cook biscuits for breakfast in a Dutch oven so oh you must be an expert huh oh well just a lot of practice oh yeah i've had um we go my family once a year goes up to the in the mountains around here it's to a place called Cup River and and camp out with the family and also a family reunion type thing and my uncle makes uh potatoes and onions in the in the in the Dutch ovens and they are sure good i so i don't know how to cook that way but it's yeah we i've liked the things i've tasted we do that for breakfast sometimes oh do you set up your own you take your own tents you say and uh yeah the the boy scout troop owns enough has enough tents for the boys you know two man tents one for each boy uh-huh and then a couple leaders have big tents that most of the adults you know sleep together in them oh and sometimes sometimes we rough it we went there's a lake called Lake Texoma on a Texas Oklahoma border uh-huh and we took the boys backpacking there that they didn't have any you know facilities or anything and we oh each we packed in our tents we packed in our own groceries our own water and stuff oh wow oh wow so you have to and boy take everything you need and do they did you just find a place that you liked and decided to set up camp there or it's it's a it's a state park uh-huh so we just you know had to check with the ranger and tell him where we was going we had a map and all oh we had the boys the boys hiked in i guess about five miles oh wow and we set up camp and you know spent a night and uh-huh do the boys like that kind of better or do they like to just go where it's close and the facilities there oh they they seem to like the roughing because they want to go again next month oh next month in December oh i keep forgetting you're it's not as cold there as it is here oh well i when i was a fourth year uh yeah no it's girl scout camper we we hiked into a spot and that was um by a lake and it was beautiful and i almost think that's you feel more rewarded when you when you do it that way than when you drive in with uh other stuff it is a lot more work though yeah it takes a lot more so did you camp when you were growing up or is this something you've just done as a result uh i was in scouts as a kid so you know i've gotten when camp with kids i've gotten used to it and uh-huh uh my wife was from Mississippi out in the country and she's her family camps they you know they spend they spend a week on a lake fishing and stuff uh oh in fact a few years ago we on Labor Day weekend we went into the Arbuckle Mountains in Oklahoma oh took three days we camped at a different site each day oh how nice and that was enjoyable boy that sounds like it sounds like it was a a nice trip huh i yeah i have lots of good memories when we always used to take a week in the summer my family and have lots of good memories of sitting around the campfire and marshmallows and ghost stories  all of our children are um uh well two of them are back in the house now but they're all grown twenty one and over uh-huh so um and how did you spend time with them when they were young i guess like everybody else soccer games and all sorts of games and carpools and traveling and um they we seem to be together enough um-hum well um was there was always one parent here at least because um we'd never usually leave together um-hum and i usually work teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime and i mean at night and then i was here most of the day if they were when they were here so they didn't spend a lot of time by themselves how many children do you have oh um-hum three two girls and a boy um-hum well i had two boys and i'm a grandmother now so my children are grown also and they live away from me so i don't see them much but so oh you are well we had uh that those they were all away and now there's uh one's coming back from college and the other one has just graduated and stayed back home so uh-huh oh i i tried to spend a lot of time with my children when they were young we spent lot of value time um creating things and building things together i feel the families watch too much TV today um-hum oh absolutely yeah that's the truth we didn't have a TV for three and a half years when they were in school early school for some reason and they did so much better and then we went back to TV's um-hum you can just see it that well i tried to put a limit on it when they were in school to so they could only watch so many hours per day of TV so um-hum where'd your kids go to school well we traveled we moved around quite a bit so they went to a lot of different schools oh they weren't here in north Dallas huh oh no they did go a year in Palestine uh-huh but we did move around quite a bit so yeah well i don't know that i i just uh that's that that TV's probably one of the problems and then both parents working and but right right uh that's a i don't think a good situation but i don't imagine it'll change i don't think so either it takes two incomes now anyway right so uh but i feel that i didn't get to spend as much time with my children as i could have or as as i should have i i was a working mother and you probably didn't if that's right if you had to work uh-huh uh it's just almost impossible um-hum especially when they get up to the age where they have so many things they want to do on their own so um-hum i remember the things that they really liked my oldest son he liked kites he always wanted always building kites and working on those he loved kites um-hum so uh well my all three of mine ran sports so we spent an time lot of time with their different sports activities because they all played and uh uh-huh now they're all in college or one two one out and two in still in college so well mine they were in the music end of it instead of sports they did my oldest son did play a little football and soccer but i had them in the band they were playing horns in the band um-hum yeah so well we probably if they're alive and kicking we probably did did a decent job yeah nobody's perfect all you can do is your best and right shit absolutely that's true uh-huh so anyway well well i have three grandsons now and i one of them uh two of them's in California and one of them's in Arizona and i'm gonna get to see them at Christmas time so oh great yeah i uh it's gonna i'm gonna enjoy that i would hope so they're all little they're little kids so but i bought little things for them to work on and to try to keep them busy um-hum yeah that will be yeah that'll that'll be fun look forward to that you're gonna fly out there no i'm going to drive to Arizona uh hum oh you are ooh i've done that a few times that's a tough drive it's worth it to see my family sure you just gonna try to spend spend the the uh spend the night somewhere oh yes uh-huh well we always stopped at Pecos that seemed like like it was a good i have a sister in New Mexico so i'm gonna stop there at my sister's uh-huh oh yeah well that'll be great so well anyway it's good to talk to you well the they won't be be upset with us if we hang up too soon i don't i don't know i think i haven't done that before usually i talk and talk and talk they usually come on and say something don't they uh yeah when our five minutes are up well that's all right how long have you been with uh TI oh i'm just a temporary i work for Manpower there and oh oh okay and uh what do you teach in i teach history oh yeah oh that's very few people are interested in that history yeah and chemistry so uh yeah there's not not many people like it but it's uh you can get them get them hooked on it if your pretty good what are your son your children what are they going into they you said they were in college uh the boy is going  Laurie okay yes i'm supposed to ask you how do you make use of your credit cards and i'm supposed to compare those with my my habits okay how do i make use of credit cards um yes let's see i carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because i don't ever have cash right and i don't i do you work for Texas Instruments no i do not okay well at TI we have to use what's called a texteller if we want to get cash out and those are only available at TI uh-huh oh okay so if i'm in a mall or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money so i'm always using credit cards sure well myself i always try i'm i'm a traveling person um-hum and i'm out of town quite a bit so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lodging entertainment and for everything um-hum yeah me too so that's uh as far as using them outside that i'm not i don't use them too much but i don't think i i think my wife is sort of like you she uses a credit card most of the time yeah so she does most of the shopping for our household so she'll use them more than i will uh-huh but do you get to pay the bills yes but so it's me i'm always i'm the guy that always goes to like Dillard's and i'll go in and charge something and and i'll have to give them my driver's license they'll have to look up the number because i'm never carrying a credit card same at my house uh-huh yeah but i do carry like my American Express and my Visa which i use for you know primarily work type things uh-huh yeah this is my first call by the way so oh it's mine too yes oh is it really all right so we're both beginners then yeah i've had this for a couple weeks and i've been out of town so this is my first time to oh okay okay now did you pick this topic or were you given to use it so no i was given this topic i see okay yeah they give you they assign you a topic you call the eight hundred number have you tried it yet right no okay when you call the eight eight hundred number they assign you a topic and uh pretty uh cut and dry huh okay um let's see so how long are we supposed to talk for i'm not sure a couple about about two minutes three minutes i think okay but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards i one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards i always try to pay them off because i just sort of detest paying interest oh yes definitely and uh like years ago my wife and i got married uh-huh she was the one with a little better heel than i was because i had my credit cards i think up to the limit and i was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that but oh that'll cost you a fortune that was like thirty years ago so now it's a little different we i get a bill and i pay it the same day it comes in yes yes or at least i try to and i just try to tell my kids how much i hate paying interest so they should follow the same rule that's right well yeah if you pay it that way it i mean it really is it's like getting a free loan for a while oh you bet it's a which is what i do it's an absolute savings or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in you get to keep the money you bet that's that's very handy yeah it works great well i think that's all i have okay well it was nice to meet you nice to meet you and uh give it a try i think you'll enjoy it okay thanks bye-bye okay thank you bye  okay what do you like do you watch TV much okay what do i like well my kids watch it quite a bit i have teenagers and so no they they watch um oh TV probably more than i would like for them to we watch really we watch VCR more than we watch TV but i'll tell you what show i don't like rather than what i do like really oh yeah okay i don't like Married with Children no i don't watch that in the i did watch it in the beginning when it was new and it was kind of funny a couple of times and then i don't i don't watch it do you ever watch it well my kids like it they all think it's funny and they all say good grief you're just too you're too old fashion it's just a spoof but i really dislike what it says about marriage i dislike what it says about raising children yeah yeah yeah well everybody says oh it's it's just supposed to be funny i don't find it funny i find it insult it was just for a kick i know yeah but look at the soap operas i don't i work so i'm not a soap opera person and so i just never watch them yeah i do too i know yeah i'm not a TV person i haven't been a TV person and i really didn't even know what was ever on and then this year for some reason i have a twelve year old and for some reason we've just gotten real comfortable with these little sitcoms at night which ones do you like oh just the little funny things we love Full House and i love Full House i think that's probably one of my favorite shows you know i just yeah it's mine too and i just it's nice and wholesome and there aren't very many of those you know so we look forward to that and i love i just love that little bitty girl on there she's so cute yeah no there aren't she's a sweetie and it's uh it's really neat because they really have watched her grow up uh-huh did you see it a couple weeks ago when they had her fifth birthday that was so precious yes they went through all yeah it was really well done it was and i hadn't realized that she'd been on the show that the show had been on that long that she was so tiny yeah and that she was just i remember when it very first came out i remember watching the very first episode oh i don't remember and God they were all so young well you know the girl that plays DJ Cameron that's um Kirk Cameron's sister do you ever watch Growing Pains yeah right right right yeah i know who he is i don't watch it i don't like it very much do you watch that oh really huh that's interesting now i like Growing Pains yeah i just never i never got into it and it might be the time that it's on and i'm not sure when it's on but it used to be on Wednesday well first it was on Tuesdays and then they switched it to Wednesdays and i hated that time frame because i had church choir and now it's on Friday nights um-hum i don't know why i don't know why i never watch it maybe because it's the weekend no it's Saturday nights could be could be and i'm not home a lot but i think i liked it when it first started better than i like it now yeah really i never got into it very much and my daughter loves Quantum Leap and i hate that show no i've never watched it it's just oh he's so it's such a strange thing have you ever seen it not me Quantum Leap it's he changes he has a little buddy that's sort of like a conscience or something i'm not sure and he goes to a different time hm you know a time in the past it's sort of like a back to the future theme and he goes back and he changes things oh okay oh so that they're not like somebody doesn't die but he becomes that person i mean he's already been a pregnant woman and had a baby i mean it's it's uh it's a ridiculous ooh hm i think i might have trouble with that it's a really uh i have trouble with it it's just a really ridiculous show i just hate it my daughter looks forward to it she likes it but but your daughter likes it that's funny i yeah i guess so i don't know but i just i like that kind of thing and i like Brooklyn Bridge that's a new one to see uh Brooklyn Bridge you like what i don't watch it either it's a new one that just came on this year and i like it because it's the fifties back in Brooklyn oh see i would probably like that too i enjoy things like that well being from New York i relate to when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn and i mean back you know and so it's like that time and the kids are little when i was kind of little you know and it was oh it's sort of like that so it's a little bit nostalgic for me and the things that my father talks about a lot of them are in the show you know so that kind of thing yeah so i like that i understand well i think i need to be going because i'm trying to get dinner on the table for my daughter and me oh can we do that we don't have to tell them i mean they don't tell us when to hang up huh they only tell us when um when we're down to the last oh oh i didn't know that oh okay well you better pull your little paper out you better pull your little paper out and keep going then it's not over time when you have to hang up because you've run out of time i know i forgot well maybe someone will call me again maybe they will oh it's been fun to talk to you you too bye-bye thanks i hope so listen i've enjoyed talking to you have a nice evening bye  my TV down okay i'm sorry uh invasions of privacy um what most annoys me are all sorts of um-hum phone calls trying to to sell me things um-hum all all sorts of hours calling and um-hum especially with it being that i want investment advice that i want this service or that service or the other thing yes and i hate those canned messages they put on my recorder um my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congress and not clear just what went into the even the final will i think it does something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers um-hum i guess in some cases they just consider pickup your your phone and and and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not um-hum um but i thought i saw something about having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial use and and uh and uh people businesses would be prohibited uh from calling for purposes for purposes of of selling you things i'm sure that's true i have through the phone company um no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received ah something i probably should do too i think i think government can do that now is that right um-hum and uh especially with with possibly children around um that could could be useful protection um-hum right yes and i don't have children around but i just don't like those nine hundred numbers so i've excluded those yeah uh but isn't it does not stop you from the uh dialing services i should do that what are dialing services where they uh intend to sell you things oh oh where people just just call you um-hum um-hum and leave again that canned message on the um yes what another problem that has been eliminated those problems used to be when i used a credit card um-hum they'd want to have my phone number um-hum and i did not like giving it out or even give out my work number right but i think i'm not sure if it's by law or just otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated of asking for a phone number well that's the thing i hated too about uh Radio Shack if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number how did Radio Shack work and i don't think they're gonna call me and ask me how it's functioning and and i don't give that out i have an unlisted number so i don't yes that's that's that's one solution but you you you nonetheless often get get people calling you sir despite the fact that your number is unlisted um-hum and you believe they actually have your number or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours well anything that you buy um-hum um you can you may get put on a a uh preferred list that is purchased um-hum and and companies can purchase this list and what that is is people who buy from the mail yeah and they so whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers um-hum um i don't particularly mind the addresses um is there anything you can do about that like give out a phony phone number uh not not really um no uh that unfortunately is legal so they can't stop people from uh uh advertising and that and that's what it falls under it falls under the guise of advertising so i don't care for it but it is a legal uh uh solution for some companies so but that's the way things are uh-huh yeah i i don't know i think it's gotten much worse the last few years um-hum um-hum maybe that's just because i've gotten on more lists well they you know that's that's the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy you've got the holy rollers and you've got uh all kinds of people knocking on your door yep um who want to uh either direct you to the right path or or or want to uh sell you uh paper routes uh whatever so um you know it's not just the phone telephone yeah sell you magazines uh-huh i guess for whatever reason i guess we just don't get  okay um they said to discuss the type of novels i read for enjoyment i like mysteries i i i really enjoy a good mystery i uh-huh i'm not into the gory bloody type murder things but i like a mystery to curl up with at night and um do you enjoy mysteries well i do i don't read much of them i i i tend to watch movie mysteries more than read mysteries i read other types of books but who's your favorite author in terms of mysteries oh uh-huh uh-huh well i enjoy Victoria Holt i like you know that that era and that type of a a setting so i i that the the type of area that i read um what kind of books do you enjoy uh-huh um-hum well my my books are a little bit more uh different than that um i tend to um right now i i do a lot of um reading of the mystic um Catholic i do a lot of Catholic saints uh i do a lot of mystic um the um-hum um-hum the ancient um writings and i've been doing a lot of that kind of reading and um so like Saint Francis of Assisi and Teresa Viola um oh oh uh-huh uh-huh Teresa Saint John of the cross um those kinds of of writings uh sort sort of um old spiritual leaders um oh that's oh that's great it's been real fascinating and boy it sounds fascinating that that's been a lot of my reading for the past number of years and then i read contemporary people um um-hum who um combine religion and psychology and that's been an interest of mine and so um-hum oh right now i'm currently reading a man named Morton Kelsey and uh his his a book on it called Transcend and it's a story it's about prayer and um and it sort of combines uh some of the old um with the new uh-huh oh oh uh-huh so uh i well that's fascinating yeah i do that kind of reading although i do do some uh casual reading my reading lately has been fairly heavy but um that sounds heavy in fact it it is yes but i just read i've read Prince of Tides have you you know that's going to be a new movie and uh-huh uh-huh yes that's a good book if you yeah very good book is it oh i would highly recommend it um it's not a mystery uh it it is of sorts and it's it's really it's it's fiction but it's an excellent book i uh-huh um-hum uh-huh oh that's interesting i it sounds like my my novels that i read i don't do that real often i'm like you i'm more into the self-help help and the um of course child rearing i like to read about that i have four children and and i like religious books also and um you know that that's interesting that that you read those type things are they are they hard to understand it depends i think i've i've learned through the years different books speak to different people and i say you know my recommendation is for people to try it and if if they can understand it they're supposed to read it and if they can't you know then don't try um-hum put it away for another time um-hum um-hum because i really do think it depends on on where people are at the particular time as to whether or not they can read it and for me on certain books speak to me and certain books do not so you know i i it hm oh and i just think not every book is for every person these are not like you know best sellers so um uh-huh i agree uh-huh now when you go to the do you get them from the library or i tend to buy them at a place here called Dallas Books and it has wonderful um oh wonderful books and i tend to get them there i have i have a fairly expensive library now of boy of things that i have read um another person who's wonderful who's more contemporary but who has recently died is Thomas Murtin and if you've read any of he was a Cistercian monk uh-huh oh oh and his writings are wonderful and he was a prolific writer and uh you'll see if you know the name you'll see it quoted often um and and he huh he's really quite good and i think his books are a a tad easier to read you know i think that's a good place to start oh uh-huh um have you read Scott Peck that's another good place no i haven't he wrote this this is what started me on all of it was The Road Less Traveled that was a that's been a best seller oh oh yes i'm familiar that now i'm familiar with the title i wasn't familiar with his with his name but well he um he's wonderful and i recommend that book to anyone um-hum um that is a great place to start and so it's called The Road Less Traveled oh oh i'll have to do that wonderful book if you're into religious reading um uh-huh and psychology it he's he's a psychiatrist and he was converted late kind of late in life and it's sort of his story and it's quite good um oh oh huh now do you um when do you do your reading do you at night i tend to read at night um-hum i have i have two children but they're eleven eleven eleven and fifteen so at night that's when i do oh they're a little bit older how old are your children well six months and three years and six years and eight years so that's the only time i have to read is late at night and sometimes i'm too tired to do that but i do love to read yes i am uh-huh oh goodness you don't have time to do anything i bet i bet now are you Mormon okay i i just assumed that because you're from Utah but uh yes yes i  surprised to get anybody this time of day but i've been i've been trying all different times and i don't get anybody at five thirty i don't get anybody at nine at night so i thought i'll try a really weird uh-huh oh well i'm at work and i just happened to walk back into my office i've been gone for a little while oh well well i go to school so i'm home certain days and um i really haven't been making many of these phone calls have you got uh-huh i don't make i haven't ever made any i just receive them have you have you received many here i haven't here lately yeah yeah it it's uh well the first time we were on this it came just about every day i never had to make one they just always came yeah yeah exactly people must be tired of it or something well well anyway i guess we're supposed to discuss this uh subject what do you think well i never gave it any thought myself i was hoping you could tell me what you thought oh well i don't have any objection to people doing that i think it might be good for them but as a mother of uh-huh two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent is i'm just concerned about their safety more than because if they do good works in America they'll probably be sent to a ghetto exactly um-hum um-hum um-hum and if they were sent to a third world country i couldn't help but worry worried you know yeah yeah but that would be my main objection um-hum um i don't know i think maybe it's it should stay on a voluntary basis i don't think it'll probably never happen but yeah yeah i i i think it would be good for uh everyone to do something like that but i i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you yeah well it it probably won't i don't i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway we can't uh um-hum um-hum seem to pay for all the things we have going now that's another consideration um-hum exactly but uh i don't know some some kids are so spoiled nowadays it might be a real eye opener you know really i mean sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes and then they think they're just kind of shocked at that side of town you know i probably lived in one of those when my i was a little girl uh-huh um-hum i have a girlfriend that every time her son starts taking things for granted she threatens to send him to Mexico with her relatives and let him get a taste of that for a while wouldn't it though oh boy that'd be an eye opener wouldn't it i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country uh-huh it is i know sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world and helping some countries i never even heard of uh-huh um-hum i know it seems to me we uh it be to our benefit to strengthen that country um-hum um-hum right on our borders um-hum but what do i know right i'm just sitting at home and and uh doing laundry today and certainly not up nobody has called me from Washington oh but um oh shoot anyway how did you get on this program i work at TI oh you do work at TI oh you're in Lewisville oh yeah i just went by that place we were going to a football play-off game a week or so ago which we lost and we went by that's the first time i'd seen it looked really nice a lot of trees there it looked like a pretty little uh site uh-huh yeah hang on a minute sure hm do you need a bag no i don't think so yeah Patty might okay i'm back oh sure but how'd you get on it did well my husband works at TI over on uh Central uh why we're living in Arlington i'm not so sure but he works over there and that's we did it last time oh uh-huh and uh so just my daughter and i are registered this time i don't know they didn't even ask him back that was weird wasn't it really huh but like i said i hardly ever get any calls this time and i can never find anybody uh-huh i don't get too many hm i so um the first time i used to get calls from far away too right um-hum like Maryland and New Jersey and but now it just seems like it's in the Dallas Fort Worth area that i get calls from yeah i've had the same experiences all right around here um-hum um-hum yeah i don't know uh i wonder if they really i don't know if they could possibly teach a machine to recognize the all different accents there's just there's so many within this one town uh-huh uh-huh you know even even in some families some people talk a little bit different oh yeah yeah my husband's from New Jersey and one of his sisters says things that really sound funny to me and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way and that's one family right course i think everyb ody in New Jersey sounds a little bit funny but you you know how that goes oh God oh i agree oh shoot well i'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet sometimes she says at night yeah uh our switch are are overloads so please end your conversation uh-huh uh-huh right well well do you have anymore words of wisdom about the subject you don't have any kids you wanna send over there no i sure don't no no kids oh shoot well it is well uh i don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto well one of them is real idealistic she might my sister is i'd be more suited to that than her she's just bugs  i'm kind of ambivalent myself uh oh we we have that kind of a program at uh at work but uh i'm not crazy about it myself well i think that it can be um a hassle but considering some of the things we picked up um i think it's i think it means as much to get a clean one i think being able to prove that you're clean is is quite beneficial to the employee uh-huh especially when there's been in an accident of some kind or you know something didn't go right right i know our company requires it before uh employment and then if there's an accident on the job they require it oh right and i does your company do the same um they require they require it before on a accident uh employment as as a condition of employment and then uh they have random testing yeah okay i don't know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at TI well we hope they are at ours too but that's just in our policy and procedures yeah but um we um i think in a in a way it's a protection for the employee i really because they can say that uh it definitely wasn't their fault if they work on it you know hurt on the job i guess you could view it that way i tend to be more concerned about uh where it'll go from here and uh yeah also i not convinced that the at least the kind of people that i work with i'm not convinced that that's really uh doing much for the program for the uh drug problem oh well i think uh the sensitiveness of either one of other professions requires complete ability to think properly um-hum and i think from that viewpoint it's not a bad idea but uh i'm not sure that the random testing i'm not so sure but i think if um if there's any suspicion that a person is using drugs i think that the employer should be able to do a little bit of testing yeah for cause oh yeah yeah for cause for cause i just um i'm not convinced that that wheeling all this machinery in place and testing a lot of um uh people who as far as i can tell uh i i think the yield is very low yeah it is even around here um it's uh a lot of expense i know for oh it is um-hum it's a lot of trouble too because most of the time especially for TI they have to do chain of custody companies that aren't doing well and um with even with the money we charge for it it uh um-hum it uh it's not a money maker no not at all but we we do have in our particular facility we have a special area where uh we do special toxicology work and uh the security involved is tremendous so it's uh one of those things that i know at least in our area is it provides properly which should be you know kind of comforting to people who have to have it done yeah yeah well i haven't been uh selected for random testing yet but i'm not looking forward to it well oh well all you have to do is go in and give a specimen then go on your merry way yeah i understand that yeah but i'm more something of a civil libertarian i guess yeah don't have to worry about it oh well and uh i think uh i'm just worried about what what they'll do next well yeah there's some of the tests that uh i think uh still we have a right to privacy yeah particularly if there um i'm worried about this business of uh detecting everything that could be possibly wrong with anybody and then adjusting health insurance accordingly oh yeah oh yeah i know when some of the disclaimers came out you know and permissions you had to give on health insurance they're gonna start there's yeah uh right first i had this young lady read it i said i want you to be sure and read this before you sign it she read it she said i think i'll go call my lawyer yeah she came back in and she says i don't think i want this and i said i thought didn't think you might but you sign away your rights right i'm afraid they'll start uh picking out people with every possible type of risk factor and trying to exclude them from health coverage oh yeah well they do that to some extent already yeah so i i'd we went into that right drug testing could uh could be the first step towards that so i hope they do it very very carefully and uh right we could um well uh sensitive to what the to the peoples privacy um-hum we do them um for the people i have a have a program where we can do them for the individual um-hum which is a little unusual but its done through the auspices  all right i think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight which is movies correct that is correct are you a movie buff okay um yeah i don't like going to see them in the theaters but outside of that rent a lot watch them on TV mostly well i have a VCR and i see most all of mine there what have you seen recently that you enjoyed uh i don't know um actually earlier tonight we were watching To Live and Die in LA have you seen that movie no i haven't it's a kind of one of those psycho ones now i i live alone consequently i don't like these things psycho things oh it's not too bad one of those cop thrillers but oh okay have you seen the movie if do you have a VCR yes we do have you seen the movie Class Action with Gene Hackman uh no i haven't yet i saw it this weekend and it is uh to me an outstanding outstanding movie i thoroughly enjoyed it he is uh an attorney and his daughter is an attorney and she has a suit against his company you know it's one of those things but there's a lot of yeah well well it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy yeah he's a good actor though beg pardon um Gene Hackman's a good actor i think uh do you see Hoosiers yes he is yes i've seen Hoosiers saw it just again the other night for my yeah actually i we saw her just the other night too oh did you yeah and it's one of our favorite movies i i live with um a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months have you seen the movie um Crossing Delancey yeah now that's one i have watched oh six or eight times i always feel so good when i get through with that movie yeah i like those movies that you watch time and time again i do too Dirty Dancing and Crossing Delancey are two of my favorite so well what business are you in i'm i'm an electrical engineer oh in New Hampshire all right i work in Massachusetts actually oh all right okay so is everything going all right up there um it's only about um half an hour i live with on the border oh well that's not bad then if half an hour we do that just going to downtown Dallas that's right so see we live up in tax free New Hampshire and drive down to Massachusetts to work that makes a lot of sense but um we are you a native of that part of the country yeah i i grew up in New Hampshire it seems southern town it's called Portsmouth it's i don't know fifteen minutes from the Mass border and five minutes from the main border we live right in the corner oh that one little spot in New Hampshire we have ten miles of coastline i live on one of those that little ten mile spot uh sounds wonderful did you have damage this year with hurricanes not up um where i live but further down the coast in Massachusetts they they got hit pretty bad i happened to be in Nassau and we got the backlash of that thing and they had record high waves thirty year high waves come in there and it was quite an experience so well what movies are you looking forward to seeing now um well i'm i'm only twenty seven years old so The Doors movie that's out on video i wanna watch that okay have you seen Green Card that would be pretty good no i haven't seen that one that's a real warm movie it it really just turned out nicely so i would recommend that if you have a chance i'm in for it we rent a lot of movies so we we often sit around and say what movies should we rent and we don't know well if you if you can get Green Card go for it all right we'll try that one i have been working at uh as an accountant at the medical school here in Dallas and i have watched um Gross Anatomy have you seen that one yeah i did okay and i don't know i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school but i hope you have a very merry Christmas you too i'm looking forward to it i think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says well  um do you golf yourself or are you a spectator well no i i try you try my husband and i uh took it up last year last summer so oh uh-huh we try and it it we really enjoy it we're having a having a good time although can be rather frustrating how about you do you did you take a class or did you just start um we took a golf clinic there was about i don't know twelve fifteen people in it uh-huh oh and we took lessons for about seven weeks we went once a week and and that's how we got started oh that oh that probably helped a lot i'm more of a spectator i i have been a couple of times with my husband but i yeah um i'm more of a spectator my relatives have a cabin and it's right on the fifteenth hole of a golf course oh how nice it is and we just love to sit and watch the the people golf it's it's fun to see them i i enjoy looking at uh-huh noticing different golf courses and the way they're set out you know the the layout and are some of them harder than others or yeah oh yeah definitely they're do they have so they do they name the golf courses like this is a you know beginning one intermediate or you know i've never really heard of it but they do something called the slope rating uh-huh and i'm not into it that much to really know but i think that has something to do with how easy or how hard the course is oh oh um uh my dad has talked about it and i'm just kind of like okay whatever so i'm not really sure or not but i think that's how they rate the the different courses oh so now when you go do you take a caddy or do you just go yourself or oh no we go ourselves a lot of time we'll walk just to get in the exercise uh depending on how the weather is if it's too hot or something then we'll then we'll ride but we we just like you know getting outdoors and oh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and walking around and playing and spending the time together probably yes and that's something that that's a sport that a husband and wife could do together oh yeah do you so we we you ought to take it up it really is a lot of fun it looks fun and it doesn't look that difficult i mean i'm sure that's what everybody says that hasn't tried it yeah well you know you sit there and watch the pros on TV and it's like oh they make it look so easy and you're going oh i can go out and do that and then you get out there and it's kind of a different story uh-huh uh-huh oh well that's what i i noticed uh the golf course that we watch most the times they have you know the sand traps and the little lakes and there's a a river going through the middle of it and the trees and yeah i think boy i in fact we do find a lot of golf balls off to the side of the road that have been hit off you know and and that's fun we enjoy walking looking for the golf oh yeah yeah golf balls now how long does it take to to to play a round of golf usually if you're gonna play eighteen holes it usually takes about four hours oh a lot of times um you know you've got groups in front of you and sometimes you have to wait and and that kind of thing so it you know it can take take a long time um-hum do you usually play the full eighteen rounds or do you just do the nine or sometimes we do nine it just kind of depends if we decide to go out you know in the afternoon and just want to go and play nine then we'll do that but usually we play eighteen uh-huh oh so would you recommend taking a class before you just go out on the course and try and try and start golfing yeah probably so just so that you know you know the courtesy and and get at least the basics down so you feel a little bit confident because i know the first time i went out to play i waited until i took all the lessons uh-huh uh-huh and i was i was so embarrassed because i thought oh i'm gonna be holding people up behind me and they're gonna be laughing and oh you know you just i guess you just get nervous and then after you've been out a few times you just say uh-huh oh well you kind of get used to it uh so do you have your own clubs or do you you each have your own set of clubs uh-huh yeah we each have our own clubs when we took our lessons the instructor provided clubs for us because which was really good oh because you know when you're just starting out you don't know what type of clubs to use you know what's the best for you and so there's no sense in buying a set and then finding out later that you really should be using something else um-hum yeah no uh-huh well that's my husband he took a class in college and he really enjoyed it and uh-huh i've since thought about buying him some clubs but i don't know the first thing about it you know and i wouldn't even know where to begin whether yeah well you can go to you know a golf shop or something that's what we did when we went to go look for them and they helped us out a lot oh oh to tell you the lengths to get and yeah and the different type of oh well that's interesting huh yeah so that that helps boy i'll say yeah because i like i say i don't even know where to where to start what to do but i guess that's i'm sure there's books and on on golf that you could read too so yeah yeah so do you have a favorite course that you usually go to or do you well we have we have one that it's not our favorite one but it  way the way i'll go ahead and start the way i work i the way i dress for work is uh this year nineteen ninety one has been really suit and tie or i shouldn't say suit but coat and tie everyday uh-huh uh-huh a a year ago i changed jobs from being a researcher to doing marketing for the research group um-hum uh-huh which means uh kind of a i guess it's a different set of standards i guess yeah so uh i i dress almost the same everyday i mean pretty much it's a white shirt and slacks and shoes and a coat uh-huh uh-huh but it was very different before how would you dress well i'm a drafter so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes and i have a sweatshirt on today and that's pretty much the norm for me if i come in in a dress everybody's shocked um-hum yeah i understand they ask me you know what are you doing in a dress and it's usually i haven't done my laundry lately ran out of jeans right i understand that's funny so does it change no no hum-um your your dress no so or do i guess do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that so back in my old job up until through nineteen eighty i would no hum-um um-hum usually wear blue jeans and pullover shirts and the like but probably once a month or so there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit yeah presentation customer presentation or something yeah yeah every now and then i'll get dressed up and come in but that's for my husband's job and not mine i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him but oh i see i understand uh oh well that's interesting so let's see uh what else about this hm it it seems like TI is pretty cut and dried with the two like two or three levels that there's the top upper management that always wears gray suits uh-huh uh-huh and the people that don't uh i don't know if you noticed if i wanna say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever like i used to be in that research and i guess you are that we dress in the jeans and then there's kind of the uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh the branch manager level or marketing people that kind of do that middle thing um-hum yeah yeah middle middle of the road but there's not much it's nice that there's not a requirement um-hum um-hum sometimes i think there should be some of these women around here look like they came off of Harry Hines for it oh yeah right yeah i guess you see those once in a while and you know the they have the no shorts deal and some of these mini skirts you know are worse than shorts ever thought about being but um sure yeah you know that's i guess that's one of the things you got to put up with when you don't have a dress code that's right that's right i guess that that isn't there a dress code something about spaghetti straps i'm not even sure what they are supposedly and backless things but i've seen those too oh yeah oh backless all right okay so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation but i think we we did it but uh yeah okay and and your name was Lisa Lisa are you the Expressway site great i am yes and i work in the north building um-hum oh okay uh well thank you all right good day thank you um-hum bye bye  do you have any do you have any uh major preferences as far as television TV um trying to think i was trying to think of some while they were calling you um i like Friday what is it is it Friday or Saturday night shows i think it's Friday night um-hum yeah all the um the one with the two little girls in it what's it called yeah uh oh uh or three little girls yeah the the two twins play the the twins play that one the the youngest girl right oh yeah right i really like that what's it called i trying um i don't know all i can think of is the name of all of them in the family but that's not it Full House yeah yeah there you go yeah i really like that show yeah that is good i i like uh we have cable i really like watching the old Nick at Nite shows you know where you get to watch Dragnet and Mister Ed and oh uh we we can watch those all night sometimes and Donna Reed yeah oh really um lately i've been getting into talk shows and yeah just you know controversy and oh yeah which which which one do which ones do you like just really whatever just as long it depends on the subject actually where where it's more interesting some of them get pretty boring but uh-huh right uh-huh yeah yeah uh there's that guy i think it's out of Dallas his name is um oh i wish i could remember his name is he one of the talk show guys yeah he's he's black and yeah no he's black and has a bald head and his first name starts with an M Maury Povich hum let's see oh it's like his first name's like Marlo Marlo or Marlin i can't remember his name anyway he always has like really strange shows like uh uh male strippers or female strippers or really sensationalistic you know uh like what Geraldo used to be yeah it something yeah see i don't i don't like those i like yeah i don't either it'd more controversial subjects i think uh-huh but i mean yeah yeah do you watch cartoons a lot no i'm no i don't watch TV that much uh anymore anymore it seems like uh i'm going to school right now so oh yeah where you going to school BYU oh really yeah so and i'm working too so everything keeps me pretty busy uh-huh uh-huh i'm going to UTD here in Dallas yeah but oh really my dad taught there for a while yeah oh really what did he teach um speech pathology that's what i'm majoring in i'm a graduate student in speech oh wow no way how long have you been there yeah yeah uh this is my first semester oh okay so you wouldn't know him he yeah who who who who who what when did he teach hum um he taught about a year ago he used to work at um um University of Texas at Dallas what no um oh shoot i can't remember what it's even called now but um he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time UTD at night and and then they stopped funding the program there oh yeah uh-huh um and so now he's at Texas Women's University yeah oh really oh is he teaching speech pathology there uh-huh okay what's his name Allen Bird Bird B I R D uh-huh right yeah he published a paper uh couple of years ago i think didn't he well well one that i read does he publish a little quite a bit um some what and he has he has some like different programs out like i don't know what they're called but they're like in he has little animals stuffed animals with him and like little cards and stuff i don't know exactly uh-huh yeah okay i yeah he has a test he has a testing yeah a testing battery he uses real yeah i remember i remember yeah well that's interesting right yeah uh what are you studying um i was i am studying nursing but i'm thinking about changing right now uh-huh i just i don't know and it's really tough to get into the program down here so if i don't do that if i decide to stay in nursing i'll probably come and go to TWU oh yeah yeah yeah i'm living in the TWU dorm across from Collier uh yeah and all oh really my dad used to teach at Collier too yeah yeah that's that's where the speech program is in uh i'm living in that dorm and there all those nursing majors i i tell you what that's that's a tough that's a tough uh field though nursing is i yeah i have a lot of respect for those people i mean they spend a lot of hours studying um-hum so you're at Baylor no i'm at BYU in Utah yeah yeah oh okay Brigham Young i see all right so but i get to come home and on the nineteenth and i'm so excited so homesick oh really do you do you do you like Salt it's it's in Salt Lake City right it's in Provo actually but yeah i really i really like it out here but i've been i i've been away too long oh it do you um-hum i'm from Colorado so i i've been away from there too long um huh how  yes uh i haven't uh talked to anybody outside the Metroplex so i didn't even think of saying Arlington Texas this is a real first are you at work yes yes i am i i i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening and i thought well i'm not having any luck i'll try the middle of the afternoon well i'm i'm happy we got through i am too well do you uh have any uh opinion on the subject well i'm i'm especially interested with what what's happening in the Soviet Union uh the the move to um uh the the the the Ukraine's vote to uh basically to secede and set itself up independently democracy hm uh is quite a remarkable oh accomplishment is that is that reported in the Texas papers oh sure well yeah we we we hear a little of the news uh God i have heard about that the last couple of days how how big is the Ukraine the area do you know um as an area it's not or a population or anything i'm really uninformed i i'm afraid i don't have the statistics in front of me it said um-hum it's not a tiny area um if i was looking at a US map i would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh well it's not as big as California proportionately maybe um-hum um-hum but but but it's it's more significant in the sense of it's a great agricultural region oh i see oh i i didn't really know that i know a lot of their oh their countries that they had overtaken or wanted to be independent or several of them right and uh Estonia what about Estonia are they yeah they're they're completely out now right i thought they were yeah the three the three Baltic uh republics got out as quickly as they could but but the Ukraine Ukraine is especially significant because it of the agriculture right it's it's very important for the economics of the whole of the Soviet Union um so they would have a probably really fight to keep it in if they could right right um except they can't fight it's done done democratically um no they don't and Bush has already given his opinion on it right didn't i read that yes yes so now uh not that they may that may matter i don't know anymore i um fear for the Russians from what i read you know i wonder how they're gonna get through the winter um foodwise or any wise sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon or not that that would do any good but i guess people do that when they're desperate that that's true uh hasn't happened here for a while but it um well that's true since the Depression i guess when the veterans went to Washington and um-hum and well you know with war riots of course let's let's hope we don't get to that point things are not so good in Texas jobwise no i've i've heard they're i hear you have some problems well we do we have lots and lots of uh layoffs here lot of companies folding lot of layoffs and it's pretty scary do you do you do you blame the the government in Washington for this well i don't understand economics that well i don't know i i i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't yes and so i assume that that has some effect yeah or a great effect and i do uh i mean they said during the Reagan Reagan Bush years the rich got richer the poor got poorer the statistics prove that um-hum um-hum so um i i guess so i mean you think it's it's you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this or is it just coincidence it was during this period well i really don't know i think maybe they uh maybe they contributed to it maybe they should pay more attention to these trade or you know to the more equalization of the trade um-hum of course if somebody in in China China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions well i don't know what's gonna happen then oh the Chinese use slave labor too that's that's one of the ways they get away with it right and child labor right well i don't know what do you think has caused our horrible situation yeah um i don't think there's any one one simple answer to the whole thing i mean it's that's very complicated one thing right well they say too that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good the i mean i've read that is a theory so which one are we gonna throw out well i hate to say it but i i'm tending to go stray back into my original democratic party i i uh-huh Texas Texas used to be a democratic state didn't it oh i know it used to right well you don't run into too many democrats anymore for a while i kind of deserted the party but now it it's looking better to me i like your governor oh do you oh i'm glad to hear that well i think so too i i just admire her her a lot she's an impressive woman yeah and uh i hope i really hope she does well but she's uh know you know probably more popular out of the state than she is here although she did manage to win but look who she was running against you know well yeah anybody could beat Claytie in Texas he shot himself in the foot so many times oh how did you get on this TI thing oh i i know some of the people  um well um guess it's logical to ask do you exercise any well unfortunately very little uh much less than what i need to i'm about the same way i i do a little bit my my job kind of hinders me from exercising i'm a night operator here at a industry down here and i don't really get out a lot during because of my job to to exercise well i uh am an assistant teacher and uh in business technology and i've i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three or four month is just jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions it keeps me pretty busy but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going and and uh right you know really exercise is so important and i realize that it is um-hum that's that's the way i feel i'm used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape playing a little basketball and stuff like that but i've gotten now i'm in college and i go to school during the day and work at night i can tell that i've not really done a whole lot when you uh exercise what do you do do you do it at home or a club or well uh i usually i'm i usually play at home we live out in the country so me and my brother'll play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play or a lot of times we're we're up at the church we'll play volleyball stuff like that i got a hold of uh Richard Simmons's tape uh oh really what is it uh i can't even think of the name of it right offhand uh with the oldies oh the Sweating to the Oldies Sweating with the to the Oldies yeah and that's not bad oh really that's pretty upbeat so you know i every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it but right not often enough to have a routine right i'll my little Schnauzer wishes i would get out and walk with her oh really but uh i don't know by the time i get home all i wanna do is just collapse or sit down at my computer and my fingers exercise more than anything now right that's the way i am i just want to sit down and relax too tired to exercise yes uh do you ever ride a bike or anything like that i did i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago and i'd ride about two or three miles a day but but it'd last about a couple of weeks and it got real cold for a little while so i gave it up here about the the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk them walk around because they're enclosed and no matter what the weather is they can walk at a pretty good clip and and not have to worry about the weather summer or winter right right i've noticed people doing that down here too i'll be in town or something and people will walk around the mall and it's safe it it is it's fairly safe that's uh you know inside the mall may be not safe going to the parking garage lot uh-huh yeah certain parts of it i know a doctor once told me it it a friend of mine uh suggested swimming as being the best exercise there is right right i used to do a lot of swimming we have we have a swimming pool and but it's an old concrete pool we've been having trouble with it the past few years so we haven't got to use it much but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that the uh swimming they say uses more muscles than any other exercise with and the water takes the resistance right right and you don't get the soreness i've i've done some water exercises but our pool is not is not heated so it's right you can't do it year round summertime only right that's the way ours is just in the summertime you don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees and and go out to the swimming pool no no no it's too cold hot tubs are not not uh not too bad but i could deal with a hot tub those are nice so what part of Mississippi are you from i'm from Laurel whereabouts is that that's way down towards the south not quite on the coast but we're about two hours from the coast oh and you do have cold weather down there yes yes ma'am it well it started about yesterday i believe it started raining and got real cold ours started Thanksgiving oh and uh from there just well today was pretty but uh oh Sunday the snow and ice came in right and uh there was no exercise  okay uh do you have young children uh-huh i have got two one is uh two and the other one's four and um this is my first year of staying home i've always had them in child care oh well then you are familiar with it uh-huh okay i uh i have grandchildren and i know uh one has gone to a well two of them have gone to preschool and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that why don't you tell me what you have found uh-huh well um it was our second sitter the first one didn't quite work out um there were some things going on that i wasn't really happy with and so i felt that that i need to move on with them and so i found another babysitter and she was wonderful except i thought that there were too many in the home and it just seemed like it was so hard to find uh really good child care she was wonderful it's just that i felt that there were too many in the home it was in home child care okay so you okay so it was in home child care you took them to someone's home uh-huh all right well both times uh-huh right um-hum and um and then i worked in in a child care centers and i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in so i just always had a fear about you know child care centers so that's why i put him in a in a in home day care oh uh-huh um-hum and then i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little and and i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill so i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more uh independent and uh i could go back to work i know that in raising my children uh hm i was fortunate i didn't have to work we didn't necessarily have a lot of things but uh i didn't and know my daughter because she has three and yeah that's how it's going now to have three in day care you know even though one of them's in school full time one of them's you know in kindergarten uh-huh that is a lot of money i mean it's so expensive you have to really make a lot of money and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life oh yeah yeah yeah uh bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something and oh no yeah you know and i know that one of the day cares and it's a a well-known chain um she was not at all happy with it because was there was too many children per person they were just kind of left to play there was no structure to it and the middle grandson went there as a uh like a preschool thing she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of of learning and training and stuff not just there you know so he went like uh um-hum um-hum um-hum i think he went well five mornings a week if i remember correctly and um wow you know and it was supposed to be a basic you know starting to learn the colors and and learning to associate with children so that when he went to you know a school um-hum um-hum and stuff and uh she was most unhappy with it there was no structure there was nothing to it you know and uh she pulled him out of that one and put him in a another one that was excellent it was it was like a little kindergarten hm um-hum and uh uh they had hot lunches and and they had classes that you know one class they'd do art they even familiarized the children with computers uh it was just it was really a very excellent one oh uh-huh and how old is he he's now five and a half he's in kindergarten this was last year oh uh-huh and uh so you know it helped him and and the first one uh he went to a uh church preschool that was very good the Methodist Church in Richardson the big one and it was a excellent they very good it uh-huh um-hum oh yes my little boy goes to the Methodist um in Garland um-hum i'm real happy with that one oh does he yeah they uh the church ones church ones seem to be very well run i well i've i've heard that the Methodist ones are excellent even uh-huh oh really even the even their Mother's Day Out programs i heard are really good oh i had uh i just assumed that most churches going by you know experience there that you know that they were good i i didn't know that uh yeah uh-huh you know i'm not that familiar i just know that you know First United Methodist there at Richardson was just a great program uh-huh yeah because this is First United Methodist in Garland that he goes to and i'm real happy with that um-hum yeah it's a pretty good size church too isn't it uh-huh um-hum yeah well that a claim so well are you enjoying staying home yes i am uh i taught for Richardson School District oh uh-huh and uh i taught early childhood and uh i really enjoyed it but it was just it was taking a lot of my time and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them and it just seemed like they were sick more often and i just couldn't get the time off to um-hum so well isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal with young children and have enthusiasm yeah it is it really is yeah it really is and i felt  all right Sandra uh what we are supposed to talk about this morning are and i i can tell that you're must be an expert child care services yes yes and my my first question is what criteria is normally applied by parents when they are selecting child care what are they looking for in other words well well in my experience um i've never i've been fortunate enough to be able to stay home with my children but um i have given day care to other children and those that have come asking me to give you know to tend their children um i guess it depends on the parent whether they're looking for a preschool type situation where they want the children to learn you know different skills and um school type things or whether they're the children are younger and they just want somebody to be there loving and nurturing um-hum what age would you say uh a child should be before you could start applying this business of teaching them a little bit preschool information we talking what six or seven or four or five hm um in my opinion i would i'm would feel that four at the very earliest i i think that children need to learn how to get along with one another and to play and to be creative and and to uh-huh they do seem to have a very much improved uh intellectual sort of a spirit they're bright they look around and and they they know what's going that's that i guess that's as important to say yeah i agree yes i agree in fact a lot of the kindergarten teachers that i've spoken with said that they would prefer that preschools yeah per se would be done away with and that the children just had a chance to you know develop the social skills that they say the the kids that come to school that have been to the preschool type settings um-hum um are are almost far enough ahead that they're bored with school yeah and they need to learn to get along but um have you ever had children in day care i'm trying to think uh yes we've had uh our children in day care a little bit but not much i the interesting comment i was going to make was that when my children grew up i felt very normal and uh um-hum um-hum with them and i didn't consider a lot of these little details that we're talking about um-hum but now that my grandchildren are growing up i look at them in a totally different style style oh oh i i watch very closely their activities when i see them and like and i can tell when they're speaking more clearly the next day and and when they are understanding situations more carefully uh-huh oh and i i don't remember doing it maybe i did automatically with my own children but i'm i'm just looking with a much higher technical detail at at the grandchildren oh oh uh-huh maybe you have more time as a grandfather oh oh well i wish i did i'm still working but i'll be retiring soon it it's it's just that uh with grandchildren they are for a short period of time and you just look at them and you absorb anything you can from them and uh yeah you start reviewing comparing when you get from them with what you got from your own children huh-uh oh but it was really a different environment oh yes how many ooh that's been what probably twenty twenty years ago something like that yes well let me ask you this is it difficult to find a day care when you have a a specific criteria of your own is that is that hard to find um-hum um-hum i think it is in fact i know that um around here one of the major problems that the working mothers have said they have is they will find a day care provider and then she will stick with it for oh you know five six months and then have something else come up and so then they are looking again for another one unless they go to the commercial day care providers and i know in the community i live in a lot of the mothers prefer just to have their children go to someone's home and i know that that's um there's a risk with that with the insurance and and different things like that but i know most of them prefer to have their children just in a a mother and child home type environment i see uh-huh um-hum so um i guess it just depends on what you're looking for and whether you mind if it was myself i would rather have my children in that type of environment rather than the the big commercial day cares just simply for the fact that there's so much illness that the little ones pass around and and you you know that type of a thing and the um that's true yes and i don't know what the one to one or you know what the ratio is for the adult providers and the children but i would think that if you had a small group it would be sure that would be my preference anyway so well my my daughter my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland oh and they have over there what they call a creche uh-huh and so her two children go to this creche which is a an all day well about a six hour  okay did they tell you our topic uh no somebody else answered the phone and put my number in uh what is the topic okay it's uh the topic is cars what kind of car will you buy next and what kind of decision you know do you okay think about getting the you know to pick that car out and uh and why okay uh my next car to buy probably would be a Cadillac i've had uh okay well i'm on my third one and i'm not real sure that i'd be in the market for a car for quite a while yeah i'm the same way i was uh i had two Cadillacs i went to my first Lincoln this last time i travel and uh my grandfather worked for Ford Motor Company so he always said why don't you drive a Ford or don't you try a Lincoln so i finally tried one um-hum my after fifty years and uh i've had i guess i guess four Cadillacs and and one Suburban in my last five cars but i bought a Lincoln and i like it my my dad has been a uh uh Lincoln man for a lot of years but i've always been a GM man i'm in the auto parts business myself oh are you and uh the last Cadillac i bought was an Allante uh-huh and i just love it to death i'm not sure i'd ever get rid of it well i'm a i'm a traveling salesman i travel on the road so i like a little heavier car so that's i used to do that quite a bit myself so that's why i choose you know to drive a heavier car and more luxury car but i tell you what i will probably get a Cadillac the next time quite honestly yeah because i like the Lincoln but yeah really there's just something about that Cadillac that whether it's a GMC product or whatever seems they handle better and they seem to put they seem to be put together a little bit better i think so too and you know the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than Ford products and i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from uh imports is they put so much you know gadgetry on the dash and and the the buttons are so small to push and GM doesn't seem to do that i kind of like that feature yeah they really do so you know i'm a i'm a funny duck that came that comes to the simple things like front end alignments i have never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac um-hum i don't know why why whether i just seem to drive them better or what but i've never had to have a front end alignment on a Cadillac they always appear to hold well um-hum i've uh i had an Eldorado was my first one was an eighty and uh uh-huh i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up and i had them do all four wheels did you and the only thing i miss about a Cadillac is a Fleetwood Brougham was my last car and i traded it in traded it in on my Lincoln and they're just not as large as before i do miss that that's true yeah but what is big today well you're right you know Lincoln still as big as it always has been but yeah it's big but the trunk space for me uh what i usually do is i usually take the backseat out of my car and that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough you know a car i ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the Lincoln Continental yeah now i have the Towncar and it's it's a deep trunk but not as broad as the uh the Cadillac well the Towncar i noticed uh or with the with the Continental uh i was rented one one time uh uh-huh uh we could uh put golf clubs in them oh good and it went all it went all the way down you know straight across i mean front to back not going from side to side well that's good that's good and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage yeah i sell sporting goods uh hunting related items i sell guns gun cases and things like that and i need to you know it's about the same size as a golf club they need to samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that and i see yeah um-hum i don't know if you've ever looked at a Continental uh nope it's not as peppy as a as a Towncar because it's a V-6 right but it uh i took i drove it from here to Memphis and i really enjoyed driving that car if i was going to buy a Ford product that's what i would buy yeah i drove mine a couple weeks ago to our one of our big national sales meetings in Nashville i usually fly i drove it with another one of my guys that worked for me we drove it's you know ten hours to Nashville and it it handled real well but my main thing is space so if a Continental i might consider it the next time a Continental has more trunk space you bet you might take a look at them they they had a a lot more space trunk space as a matter of fact they had more trunk space than my uh Sedan de Ville had you always have leather interiors on your Cadillacs um all three of mine have had leather interiors yeah yeah i like leather interiors also uh i had a eighty Eldorado which was leather leather and uh then my eighty six was a touring sedan uh-huh and uh it had the gray leather package in it and my Allante has um i guess saddle saddle colored that's a nice car type thing you bet and i'll and i will say one thing about Cadillac versus  okay uh i guess our topic is about movies um-hum and uh what a coincidence we got a baby sitter and we went to the movies this past weekend oh so did i and we saw Cape Fear oh i heard that was excellent is it um i wanted to see that i was deciding between that and uh My Girl and my boyfriend and i went to see My Girl it is it's really good oh how's that oh it was excellent it was a really really good movie i'd recommend it i i heard that's a a movie that uh you really can't take children is that true um i heard the opposite that um you should take children to see it oh um there were quite um few uh kids in there with their parents oh yeah um i don't know though i i've heard that and then what you just told me so yeah yeah because uh the little boy dies right yeah it was sad it was really sad but um yeah oh his it kind of shows how his um best friend this little girl deals with his death and how i think maybe how children should deal with death maybe oh oh uh-huh but it was really good it was sad very sad oh i wanna see that one well Cape Fear was was more suspenseful it was really suspenseful so that that's that's a real good movie to see yeah i heard it was um sort of like um not um too violent but it was kind of like um gross kind of like um Silence of the Lambs like uh no and no it uh it's kind of i don't know it's kind of both i guess but it's not it's not as bad as Silence of the Lambs oh oh really but uh it's just as suspenseful i think and it it was a real good movie oh and then we saw Beauty and the Beast because we have two kids and Fievel Goes West oh yeah uh oh i've seen um previews for them on TV but i but uh those were those were okay yeah so and then oh boy it's been it's been so long since we've been to the movies but i we've rented some videos oh yeah i like to rent movies too and i think the last one i rented was uh Mortal Thoughts with Demi Moore oh i oh i i didn't see that and um that that that's okay that's pretty good oh and um What About Bob yeah i've seen that at the theatres yeah that that was cute yeah yeah we rented that one and uh uh i guess that's probably about it have you rented any movies lately um the last movie i rented was The Hard Way with Michael J Fox and um oh yeah that was good we rented that one too yeah i liked that i like Michael J Fox a lot he's one of my favorites so uh-huh yeah yeah i like his movies so do you go to the movies often or no not too often i i hadn't been to the movies for a really long time except for this last weekend but um uh-huh there's been movies out that i've been wanting to see i just you know don't get a chance to get out and see them yeah yeah well we have two little kids so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies we have to dig up a baby sitter and oh i see and that's only the only time we can go out so our time is scarce yeah oh oh but um we we we try we you know we're we're big movie people and and we try and do and i don't i don't know about the last movie i've seen on TV that was real good um yeah oh i watched that movie with um Barbara um oh what was her name about that um her sister got killed and um she had a baby the husband husband was a dentist and he had murdered her oh yeah um that was that was pretty good Bertinelli or what's her name yeah um-hum oh Valerie Bertinelli that's it yeah i can't yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that was real good i saw that one uh two part series and i heard it was a true story yeah um-hum yeah i think that was probably the last movie i've seen too yeah and and then i saw that other movie about um Mother Daughter Mother Wife Murderer did you see that one oh um with um Judith Light um yeah did you see that one that was was really good too that's supposed to be a true story too yeah i did see that yeah i did it that was on a while ago wasn't it yeah i guess a couple weeks ago or something like that um yeah i saw that um-hum yeah that was pretty good i boy we have we we see all the same movies yeah i like um the true stories they're more interesting yeah um-hum you know it's hard to believe that you know this really happened some of them are pretty bad i know yeah yeah yeah huh well we sure do have a lot in common yeah if you're ever in town we'll go see a movie okay but and we don't really do y'all have do y'all still have drive-ins up there or yeah um-hum yeah do you have them there hm we may have just a couple over here  now we're ready yeah i had a there we go okay a family reunion this past year first time in many many years and uh-huh and i had uh three of my sisters there with their family and we all got together in Gatlinburg Tennessee and oh great oh spent the week there up in the mountains and rented a little little house little house and how nice sort of visited and got to know each other we hadn't been been around each other for quite a while over the years so it really was sort of nice oh well that is nice was it was it awkward at first or did it work out fairly fairly good well it worked out fairly well you know as a kid i don't know about yourself but we used to have big reunions and it was so nice and yes uh-huh you know it's just something that you don't do anymore and uh we had such a good time that right um-hum that we're already deciding to have one in two years say in Disney World or somewhere in Florida just get together and oh great uh-huh just something you need to make time for now are you from from quite a ways away from each other so that you don't see each other real often yes we are we're sort of uh we're in Texas and i have sisters in North Carolina West Virginia Virginia Florida everywhere Georgia oh oh yes so we don't get to see each other very often oh yes okay well we have um several different reunions when i was like you say when i was growing up we had a lot of family reunions and they were the extent of the cousins and you know relatives and great-aunts and and uncles and um those have dwindled down to just we go to one a year we have one at Christmas time and it's my father's family and sure well that's great yes it is and it and these are people that we see you know just once maybe twice a year uh-huh and we get together then and have a Christmas party and and you know have a dinner and a program and renew acquaintances and um and then in the summer on my mom's side of the family we we go camping up in up in the mountains like you mentioned yes it is it's fun well that's neat which you in a great area for it yes we are there's lots of lots of nice places to go and i know some families have a real formal type thing where they send out the letters and um assignments and have parts on the programs and quilt drawings and stuff we we don't do anything that big you know uh i admire people do that but we're just not that well organized and you know everyone's heading different directions so it's very hard to get together yes yes that is in fact i in a in a magazine i'd read an article about different ways to plan a family family reunion and you know if you had a real big like you say a real big organization and a lot of a lot of planning went into it that would that would be great but we tend to stick to the call each other and you know that we plan on those two that i mentioned every year for sure but sure that's the important thing just the important thing is to do it yeah that's right and that's great that's right because you you do you forget the the cousins i have uh they grow up and change and you know you wouldn't even recognize them sometimes other than these these times that you get together oh you bet so do you have any with your extended family or is it mostly your your sisters and mostly my sisters and brothers right now but as far as cousins we we haven't done that like i said before it's God in just forever i don't know how we'd ever get all of our cousins together you know um-hum uh-huh yeah it's like it's like high school reunion high school and college reunions uh i didn't go i'm i just turned fifty years old recently and uh-huh didn't go to many reunions until i hit my twentieth i believe and of course i haven't missed one since then because it's just so enjoyable oh oh yeah you get to see all your old friends and what's going on and it's just a it's a neat deal i look i look forward to them uh-huh boy i'll say yeah so do you when you have your when you got together with your sisters last year did was there a lot of catching up to do oh yes a lot of changes that had happened since the last time yeah kids kids getting older getting married and graduating high school and college and whatever um-hum oh just lots of things to catch up on and and we spent that time to do that uh-huh did you get take your kids with you or was it the adults no this was this was just for the big guys just for the parents oh how fun oh that's fun it was sort of neat though in fact we uh we had a little rule that we would we would not take the kids with us this time but all of our kids are a little older so oh uh-huh that that makes a big difference yes all of our kids are in a middle and high school and college so and married so uh-huh oh so we just all got together and it was sort of neat that is that is that's it's a fun thing to do and i think it's important that we keep doing that because everybody is so busy you lose you lose you lose touch and you lose ties you bet because my mother and dad both were there so it really paid off oh were they yeah it was neat and and and her four kids were there and their spouses so it worked out real well oh well great boy i'll say yes i my brothers are scattered all around too and that's you know are they yes they're they're all over the place  okay uh let me see i've got two children one is uh both preschoolers one is two and one is um four uh-huh so and um this is my first year off and i've always worked uh the time that they were little and so i decided to hold off on my job for a while and stay home with them and spend some more time with them which i hadn't been doing well i think that's wonderful my children are in college so oh but i teach school and i teach uh middle school age children oh okay and so i see a lot of uh variation in what happens when kids are at home yeah i have taught school ever since my children were little but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's and your holidays are too so teaching i think is a uh-huh yeah a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids um-hum yeah well that's what i was doing before i was teaching for a Richardson School District and um it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little and it was really hard uh-huh right well with them being as young it was much much harder when mine were young yeah yeah and uh i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his uh college work yeah and his Master's degree and so forth and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a full-time job yeah that's right that's right and that's what was kind of what what where we were when you know we i really didn't have to work but i felt like i really wanted to work um-hum and i felt i awful i felt like boy i was sure was missing a lot and they were growing so fast and you know it's like do i really need to work you know and i and it that choice was there i really didn't have to and um-hum you know so i did have that advantage there but it's different staying at home too you know it's an adjustment to make also yes it certainly is we well i think that um we need to spend more family time together with with children today uh we made a point to spend a lot of quality time and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were uh-huh involved in you know like uh through scouting or you know anything like that we participated and uh we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now yeah wow that's great when yeah when uh the kids were in high school it was harder to always have supper together but we did always have breakfast together uh-huh so we we had supper together as much as possible but when it wasn't feasible you know we kind of kept a master calendar um-hum and when it wasn't feasible well that was understandable but uh we've always tried to spend time to talk and uh yeah have some time together time and we sat around the table we didn't sit in front of a TV or ah that's great because that's that kind of thing so i think that's been important because we do have a close family and even though the kids are basically uh grown uh uh-huh they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and uh have spoken before of they want that kind of situation um-hum you know situation for them when you know and their children when they marry and have children yeah kind of grows on and um-hum they do what they see and you know that's right they model and the with the dysfunctional families today i'm sure you with a as a schoolteacher also you see what happens to these kids um-hum yeah when these families never communicate or they're dysfunctional as far as the between uh oh second families or uh one parent families or all those kinds of problems that they have and then you see them magnified magnified in the children uh-huh yeah yeah yeah plus you teach middle school so i'm sure that oh boy yes you are really you really boy oh boy i taught early childhood so i had the little ones um-hum yes and um you know i saw it there too and you you know you just oh it's it kind of an eye-opener you know so it is it is and most i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children and i think we make a point to do that um-hum yeah i think you're right because we see we see all the time the outcome of not doing that and i think if we weren't so interested in in children in childfaring we wouldn't be teaching anyway yeah right right so uh i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world okay yeah yeah because i think uh the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools it's what's happening in the families and uh they expect us to i agree yeah you know have create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers and you get to a point where it's completely impossible uh yeah yeah i agree i i know exactly what you're saying and you just get more and more frustrated and yet you feel for the the kids you do the best you can but  okay you ready yeah is that it okay um well we i guess we have to talk about magazines and um what what that's it what what kind do you subscribe to or do you well i subscribe to People well i did subscribe to People for a long time i do you know i enjoy People and now i'm um i uh subscribe to uh Ladies Ladies Home Journal i uh take a computer magazine uh-huh and uh also uh Better Homes And Garden okay are you interested in in computers and my pet peeve with magazines is all the little cards inside and the cardboard pages yeah uh-huh yeah well that that would be one of my peeves my pet peeves with magazines uh the woman's magazines especially i mean it it's really geared to your all they have is you have too many recipes first of all i just don't you know that's what i don't like about um Ladies Home Journal magazines too many recipes too many um can this marriage be saved nonsense i you know i like to read articles about things that matter well of course People magazine is not you know one of your uh no your more intellectual magazines but it's nice light reading you know if i want something intellectual i usually read a book well that's true i uh i like it when they have short stories like Redbook used to always have a good short story in it well that's true yeah they did and i i haven't bought a Redbook in a while so i guess i i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore yeah well is Redbook still in existence i didn't know if they were if they were around anymore well uh i think it is surely it's an institution surely it would have to be yeah well i'll tell you the only reason i bought the uh i subscribe to the Journal is because of but uh which i think it was either yeah it was Publisher's Clearinghouse they they told me you know if i didn't subscribe they were gonna take me off their their winning you know their list so right i know and it was serious mine too i wasn't this was it my last chance yeah my last right right my last chance to win ten million dollars so i figured hey look for twelve dollars you know well i i uh i went ahead and sent in my subscription because of that uh to uh Entertainment that's it oh yeah oh uh-huh and i was real disappointed with it yeah i i don't know it just not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into it's just little short articles more than anything else right uh-huh and that's one thing i don't like about People uh it's just you know doesn't seem to have enough story to it well i don't know i just think uh you know it's it's light reading you know you don't have to excuse well you don't have to concentrate you know you know it's entertaining you know and uh if you've only got a short time to read no that's true that's i just i enjoy it i you know i um well that Entertainment is is very wasn't that similar to or isn't it similar to to the TV Guide uh no not really i mean uh not the one i take now it's a it's a magazine and it goes into all the movies previewing the movies oh uh-huh that are going to be released or it's behind the scenes oh i see and uh i'm a real movie buff so that's why i thought i might be interested in it but it just hasn't been what i thought it would be no and uh my mother has subscribed too the reason i get uh the right Home Journal and and the uh computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me oh otherwise if if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf i'll pick it up then right right rather than to have them delivered and think oh i really need to read this well well i'll tell you since i've been getting the Journal like maybe maybe i'll read two maybe three if i read three articles in in you know one of the the Journals i figure you know i did really well yeah it paid for itself because there's just nothing in there that interests me i don't you know i don't i'm not into recipes you know recipes and you know well i i do like recipe and crafts see now and i'm not into crafts so so you know that that eliminates like three quarters of the magazine you know well well that's true i just got the new issue they have Bette Midler on the cover so that should be one article that i'll read anyway do you uh ever  well what uh what kind of recycling have you got in your community well in our community we recycle everything really oh yeah we recycle plastic we recycle aluminum we recycle paper we recycle everything well now do you participate in all of that well my wife does i'm not real high on it myself how about well i think i think that's great that she does that i i'll applaud that um do you do that no and i i as a matter of fact i kind of cringed a little bit whenever i heard the topic because i think it's admirable and i think it's something that eventually we're we're all going to have to do it uh i don't but i know the do you realize Glen that the latest Forbes magazine pointed out that it actually costs more to recycle than it does not to recycle uh in costs more in what way well newspapers for example for recycling papers to get rid of the ink it costs about thirty two percent more to recycle paper than it does to have new paper well that's interesting and i've you know i wouldn't i i mean i hadn't heard that Bob and that's that's a little surprising but you know i think about the amount of of newspaper that i throw away in a week yeah and you know you multiply that with all the people uh i'm in Houston that are that are tossing out newspapers and it i remember i i was in New York several years ago and i took the wrong turn and i went over into uh State Island where the uh uh landfill is for New York City yes and of course that's not where i wanted to be so i turned around and beat it by hasty retreat but you know just the the amount of garbage that we generate uh is is staggering and i just i don't know how much longer we can continue to just dump everything well it's uh it's a problem that uh is probably at the moment over emphasized because there is apparently more landfill available than it's a matter of economics and economically right now uh it's more of a scare tactic it appears that we are running out of things and the facts yeah in some cases are particularly paper which trees obviously by being a renewable resource and being a crop no more different than corn in effect yeah it's a situation that of economics where it's less expensive to have new newspaper than using and recycling old paper yeah and i can i can understand that i think i think about uh you know and they say that now uh a lot of the new cars for instance i read an article not long ago about this uh uh new Honda that they had come out that they're identifying on the car those uh particular different parts uh uh that are plastic so that that whenever the car is worn out and dismantled uh they can recycle the the plastic components right those are uh plastic is very recyclable and uh it should be uh that's something that just won't go away when you dispose of it and uh yeah plastics and and your metals are very worthwhile being recycles it's uh it's just a matter right now of who's going to take the time uh to do it and i i mean it's something that i personally feel is it it's worthwhile i just uh i haven't gotten into it and uh i i think i'm probably like a lot of people in that uh until it gets to the point that it's kind of mandated uh i don't think i'm i'm going to do it unfortunately i know what what city do you live in in Houston well in i live in Plano and uh they have a very big recycling program where uh for your grass clippings for example if you don't put them in a paper sack they won't pick them up they have special pick up days for for uh leaves and debris uh you know clippings type thing and if you put it in a plastic one they won't pick it up yeah really i saw an article i mean a a program on a TBS not too long ago that uh they were talking about uh recycling and they uh were showing uh in a city i think it was Portland Oregon if i remember it was either but it it was either in Washington or Oregon and of course you know those people up there are very uh uh environmentally conscious and they were uh talking about the the recycling effort up there and how they've got uh uh all these different bins and containers and that's what they're coming out with here matter of fact really yeah i haven't received ours yet but uh that's the plan in Plano also they uh bring out these humpty bins and you're supposed to fill it up with i know and you know and i'll tell you when you you know and i've been accustomed all my life to throwing everything in one bag and then uh dumping it in the dumpster it's going to be a rude awakening to have to uh start sorting everything well i i frankly  okay um what do you consider an invasion of privacy um i was just now told that's what the topic was and um i guess invasion of privacy uh to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards um-hum for example and uh i guess recently one of the TV stations here uh ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers that's very easy and use it and i was quite surprised at that i guess i can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me i don't know what i'd really do if it did no i've never i've never had that happen to me either what do you think about for instance like i was in Michael's the other night and charged something and they asked for my home phone even though you know the charge had been approved what do you think of that um does it bother you to give it no not really because i'm listed in the phone book if i was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number i i think i would be hesitant to give it you know that they they now have a uh i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on a charge ticket one of the things that upset me when i lived in California was uh they did a lot of things with your Social Security number security number um-hum as a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing your Social Security number on your driver's license oh and they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks um um-hum and i was really you know unhappy about that situation i think that was an invasion of privacy privacy yes yes i can see you know where that was i i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check i don't see any need for it when i'm charging something but i neither am i a person that has the guts to say no i'm not going to give it to you either you know and uh right one of the biggest things i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that yes yes you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines US News um-hum and Forbes magazine um-hum and every since that day i have been inundated with you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter uh even to the point of people calling me at home and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls right right i discovered with uh charge cards um and i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the uh uh credit report bureau sells it but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know um-hum from some some list yeah from from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at at Neiman's or something because then i'll get catalogs that you know are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily and um um-hum right you know and i get i get tired of that i because i look at all that junk mail and i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up you know all their time to sort and they're not even paying full postage all their time sure you know and if you did away with some of that our postal service might give better service i think the general public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for uh let's say the criminal individuals to to get access to people's records um their credit cards driver's licenses checks things like that right um-hum um i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it no no um computers ha caused a lot of this i'm sure well you know let's face it computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the the know with all if you're you know so inclined to uh oh what do i want to say have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that you know and have a basic knowledge they're very easy to get into sure seems as though they are yeah to tap into a system uh-huh you know and uh which is scary i mean you know our lives are on computers unfortunately yeah and uh and i don't know i kind of i resent the the calls of an evening trying to sell me something uh fortunately i haven't uh haven't uh been inundated with that situation yet we are constantly it seems like i don't know why you know either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows  yeah um i guess when i think of camping i think of going out and setting up a tent and and uh cooking out and that kind of thing what do you think of it as well yeah that's exactly what i think of too when that's the way i think of camping in a tent yeah not comfortably well i know we used to do that when our children were younger and uh we could uh we even had it fixed up where we could setup a tent and have a have supper ready in about thirty minutes so it worked out real well for us then have you ever done that yeah that's that's great well when i was a kid my father had all different kinds of travel trailers oh whatever he liked he had a travel trailer and he had a Winnebago and he had a truck camper and he was always buying new things like that and i hated it i i hated going camping and oh when when i got older i liked things like Caesar's Palace you know that's where i like to stay and and oh yeah and oh okay you can't you're gonna camp out at Caesar's Palace huh uh right exactly so this summer um my boyfriend lives in California all right and he loves to go camping and he said let's go camping and i went and i loved it and so my my parents couldn't believe it you went camping but it was nice it's peaceful and quiet and different perspective yeah um-hum it was just nice and i sat there and thought what do i have at home that i need that i don't have here and i couldn't really think of anything so right now where did what kind of country did you go camping in in California in the mountains oh yeah now that's so peaceful it was just beautiful and um it wasn't very crowded it was during the week and it was just wonderful um-hum yeah so that was nice so i guess i do like camping yeah well i think it depends on probably as a child you didn't feel that you left your friends at home and you didn't like there's much to do right that's exactly right boring to me um yeah uh what kind of places did your parents go to when they camped in the trailers oh they went all over just uh various parks and things yeah i mean they they even moved they did they went to parks like um well we lived on Long Island and hm we went to New Jersey and things like that you know not far away and then to the extreme um um-hum they sold everything and bought a house trailer um-hum and uh moved to Florida and pulled it behind us and that was really funny because i mean it's funny now it wasn't funny then an all these very strange things happened i mean it was just really oh my no hm well let's see Wildwood in New Jersey did you go there i think they said yes yes we did that's exactly where we went aha i thought you might i understand that's a very popular place if you live in that area really yeah lots of uh my husband was raised in Pennsylvania oh and uh some of his friends had always talked about and what got me they never went anywhere on vacation but to Wildwood and did they camp out probably i i'm you know i'm they'd go to the go to the shore go to the shore and we said you know really there are other places in the world yeah yeah yeah i wouldn't like to go to the same place all the time but hum-um but they we have these friends he went to high school with that they go to the same place every year and have for the last twenty years yeah that's boring to me too well i you know i guess it's fine if they like it but i like to move around a little bit well there's so many places to go you if you went to a different one every time you couldn't see them all so um-hum that's true and they each have their own special beauty yeah have you ever been um up to uh Lake Texoma here in Texas uh Texas oh yeah that's pretty yeah they have a a park up there uh Eisenhower Park have you been there uh-huh yeah i have it's been a long long time though now that's where one place our children used to like to go uh-huh now they like to go out and fish and things like that and course they go and do their own thing since they're grown but they uh they still talk about our camping trips so maybe they didn't dislike them so much oh i'm sure but uh are you planning to go on any more camping trips well i don't know well if you get invited huh if i get invited maybe yeah all right that sounds good if i find time yeah you stay pretty busy here then that's the hard part oh yeah what's about your ideal time when you go camping how long do you have like to go how long to go for no how many how many how many a week a two weeks a few days or um i i don't know we've only gone that one time and um-hum it was five  okay so i guess you're a Cowboy fan oh yeah i guess we're sort of we're stuck with that down here Brad we have to be but uh been it's been difficult suffering with them through the past few years but it looks like they could be that's true you know on their way back a little bit yeah what's what's the story with uh your quarterback though our quarterback's hurt right now he's gonna be out for a couple more weeks at the very least and may miss the rest of the season course if they're lucky enough to make the play-offs he may be ready for then oh that's good we're we're fortunate to have a you know a a fairly good back up quarterback that's come in but i tell you what the people of Dallas uh they love their Cowboys i'm a i've been here since seventy four and uh they're quite easy to easily to get attached to and uh we've got our new coach now Jimmy Johnson which i we like we like what he's doing they've forgotten about Tom Landry he's a great coach in his day but they've forgotten about him yeah so who yeah isn't the Cowboys were the tradition you know oh yes who who's your favorite team uh well it's kind of weird for me i'll tell you why first of all i used to be a Jet fan when i grew up right i grew up on Long Island where the Jets play uh i mean they're in New York City but it's closer to Long Island sure uh then the Giants which were up in the Bronx uh but then around eighty five the Giants started playing really good defense and they started you know really not that i'm a fair weather fan but they really started looking good you know so now i root for both teams Jets and the Giants but i'm involved in this uh rotisserie league i don't know if you're familiar with those no well you draft players from different teams so it's kind of you get points based on how many how many touch downs and and and and stuff like that that players on all different teams uh make well i'll be darned so you get kind of caught up um and now i got like you know players players on on like Buffalo and and Washington and and i i happened to have uh your kicker why sure um-hum and uh Micheal Irvin who was a great he's a great wide receiver and uh right so how how's your team doing so my team's doing pretty good for for those guys i have i do have a couple of Giants um but they're not doing that much and uh i also have well good the Giants are having a sad year one Jet yeah they're not they're not looking too good um but you know it's always tough after you win a Super Bowl i guess and i know maybe we're maybe we're both teams of the future huh yeah and they they um they um i mean last year was just fantastic with the Giants winning the Super Bowl it was just oh we're well it was fantastic they had a hell of a season yeah and it was such a i don't know maybe because i'm a Giants fan but but uh it was such a unbelievable run you know all the games were like won by field goals and stuff like that so it was oh i know they had a great coach i think they're they're missing their coach but um most of all they're just they're in a rebuilding type of thing they've got they're quarterback's down too right now so yeah the big thing oops i'm here hello big big Phil's trying to come back hold just a second that's that's my other line okay sorry Brad okay that's all right so anyway Phil's trying to bring them back right now i guess yeah they got a big game this weekend i think if they win it they got a shot at getting into the play-offs but i don't think they're gonna win who they play this weekend they're playing the Eagles oh it's a big game yeah they play at up in Philadelphia uh no they play in New York play in New York well yeah good chance there hope so but i i don't know first of all they don't they haven't done too well against the Eagles lately i think we right and we just hope we just hope Dallas makes it and of course all that depends on what Philadelphia and New York does too so i don't know and yeah i guess you got to pipe it off having the Giants uh win this weekend to knock out Philadelphia that's true because both our teams are like eight and five you guys are up what seven and six i guess you know um-hum but uh yeah i think i think i think Dallas will make it i think that i think they're they're uh they're doing pretty well and i think that like if the season ended now they'd be in the play-offs so you just have to like win two out of the next three or something yeah i hope so their first play-off games travel to Detroit i believe and that's that'll be a tough one on really oh you never know i mean what's to you know Detroit's only one game up maybe they'll oh well they lost to Detroit already though didn't they this year yes so they can right yeah it was there but they lost them playing there but uh still a tough game well maybe they'll get lucky and not have to go to Detroit because that's a tough place to play lately they but you got Emmett Smith versus Barry Sanders it ought to be a little exciting be a good game anyway yeah i guess their quarterback on uh Detroit was hurt too they're all getting knocked down so maybe they have a better shot against this new quarterback because they haven't Detroit hasn't played as well with this guy as with you bet um i don't know i think i think his name's Kramer yes and uh they used to have uh Rodney Pete who was doing really well for them and then he got hurt so yeah he was doing well and the kid from Houston they drafted from Houston uh they gave all that money to right yeah he's doing a lot they've got a lot of high dollar players i tell you yeah well uh what do you this is off the subject a little bit but what do you feel about the amount of money these guys that are are making and uh the amount of time  okay would you like to um begin or would you like me to start uh oh i can start i i think one of the the biggest uh okay improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into uh management yes and you're seeing them uh get uh elected to uh political offices uh not near enough i know there's still a long way to go especially in top management hm um-hum yes i agree you're not seeing uh you know looking at TI you see them in management but you're not seeing them up there as VPs and i have a sister that's an attorney in Oklahoma City and i know the company that she was with right uh the women didn't have have near the positions the levels that the men attorneys had and were not uh given the same respect right i agree with that i i think you do see more and more women out there in politics too as mayors or um you know in in helping to maybe um get some legislation passed to to have women have more rights i think still yes even with that whole um thing with Judge Thomas and and um you you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man or something the way they had it the trial and um i just think that it's it's still gonna take another generation or so before before the women um-hum um-hum really could really feel that they're really equal in the business world or that they work just as hard or harder um right right but it's still um going from hm from homemakers into um corporate leaders is still a big step right i also think that uh uh women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be it used to be people would say do you work and you'd say no i work in the home and it was it was then it was almost like a put down particularly particularly even by women in the work force right but i think now i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very very important and it's getting the respect and which is about time yes i think it's true i think also people are having children at a older age so maybe like um you know you go through college and then you maybe work for a few years and then you have your first child yes very definitely and um you know you you know both sides of the coin that's right you know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly and to take care of the kids and and then uh maybe people that are just working and think oh you just stay at home but then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid it's like they lose it they say wow this is harder than i thought well hm you know right yes and and and to those that have never worked worked and had you know and have stayed home with the kids kind of does your heart good because i know i stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school and uh i know it i know um-hum so you know it it kind of does me good i think also one of the things that that's really tremendous and it doesn't necessarily have to do with women but the fact that the fathers are so involved with families which again i think helps the woman's role are so involved yes right right their role has to change to kind of accommodate us too i know i have three children and my oldest is eleven and i've pretty much been home um since Brian was born you know i um-hum um-hum and um just recently i went back to work um last school semester to tutor um high school age students with learning disabilities and i was just out of the house two days a week um-hum but i thought wow this is really hard only and it was only two days and i was home before three but getting the baby to day care getting the kids off to school i still did everything i always do you know my husband still got up and went to work but um uh-huh it it only those two it made a big difference i thought wow a full time i don't think i could swing that well i had to course i work full time but my daughter and her husband were out of town personally so i had my grandchildren for four days during uh football soccer season oh oh boy and so i would work and her friends some friends would take care of the kids but i would have to get them picked up from there get them fed get them to practices get homework done get baths i was absolutely exhausted and picked up dinner right i bet i bet and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties or early forties to have their first children children i think are absolutely crazy well i i know a lot of people i know i had my first child when i was twenty five and that's not considered really young these days that's almost you know but um i have friends that that um-hum have kids just starting kindergarten and they're they're forty years old and and then like maybe a two year old at home and i think boy i i'm i'm in my thirties  uh which ones have you seen lately oh i just i'm sort of blanking tonight i just got done saying i just saw one um fairly recently uh oh i know uh uh the one with the two girls that take off from uh uh across across across the country on a crime spree Thelma and Louise yeah i haven't seen that is it good Thelma and Louise yeah yeah it really is it's it's interesting is it oh yeah i enjoyed i was gonna go see uh the Billy Crystal movie also which was i'm a little bit behind i usually rent them yeah i i'm not familiar which which Billy Crystal movie oh this is the uh just the one oh gosh it was the uh City Slickers right have you seen that oh City Slickers that's a real good show yeah it's great uh it says a lot about uh uh you know i'm i'm young but it says a lot about middle life you know and uh uh it's a really good show uh-huh yeah i i i've heard lots of good things about it and i would have would have liked to have seen it but i was with my wife and i figured she'd like Thelma and Louise better so yeah and i'd heard it was really good too so yeah uh it is yeah i'm not too familiar with Thelma and Louise uh uh uh uh recently i i've seen uh the Fisher King have you seen that yeah no no that's a really good show okay uh has Jeff Bridges and and uh Robin Williams uh-huh uh really really good yeah there's there's been a a fair number of of pretty good movies out recently yeah i mean it kind of runs in in batches i mean for a while sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just i don't even you know doesn't even sound like something i want to see you know uh uh-huh yeah what what kind of movies in general do you like to watch um well i like to be entertained once in a while but uh i i really enjoy watching a movie that uh where they don't really try and attract you know the great audience but rather put out a a real good movie um um-hum um uh always my my favorite movie of all time has been uh uh The Mission did you ever see that no in fact i'm not even familiar with it i don't think uh it's a a i think it's put out by Landmark Productions the same people who put out Chariots of Fire uh-huh uh it's a it's a has Robert DeNiro in it uh he plays one of the main characters and uh it's about uh Jesuit community in uh Mission at the Inca Falls in in uh South America Northern Argentina hm hm oh uh uh-huh oh no in fact i i i'll i'll look for it because i i've been uh really really good show yeah it's it's something that you know it's it's really stirring the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music um-hum actually yeah my wife's from down in that region around the Seven the called the the Seven Missions which are which are right down in this where i'm sure where it was filmed at oh yeah and uh i'm sure that that would make it worth worth her watching she my my uh my movie watching has has severely uh has has changed a lot since i got married oh yeah yeah she she likes uh action movies and uh and and comedies and so anything that's has anything little is a little little bit less than sort of mainstream Hollywood is uh-huh uh-huh is boring to her and so i i i i really i used to watch a fair number of foreign films i used to watch a lot of sort of the less the less popular films oh uh-huh and i find i don't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own yeah i'm much the same way i i i i have a fiance and it it gets very difficult to uh uh she yeah yeah find something both of you will watch yeah um she it's it's funny because i mean most women aren't really sort of she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of yeah she really likes all these gory shoot them up films oh really uh-huh uh-huh keep her on the edge of her seat i'll watch them you know they're kind of fun to watch in a way yeah yeah they are sometimes you're in the mood for it even yeah but uh so it it it varies i don't seem to get you know as much variety these days lately as i used to uh-huh i found when when i get when i get with my uh old college buddy we we usually rent uh good gladiator movie or two uh prior to that i i still enjoy watching those you you can't just watch them by yourself or else it's it's just not bearable yeah but it's it's fun to well yeah on the other hand you you know given that my wife likes those i i i occasionally like to watch them and and so uh you know so it's you can always count on her to watch something like that and she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff which oh yeah you know which most most women won't won't come within ten feet of yeah yeah that's that's the ones where they dub in dub in the English the the all the all the all the sounds of the karate chops flying through the air but uh yeah that's great uh on on foreign films did uh did you did you watch are you uh fluent in another language or echo i speak yeah i speak several uh but i i don't mind watching subtitle movies uh no i i i don't oh you don't i i don't either i i feel foolish sometimes because i i don't speak another language fluently but i do enjoy watching you know subtitles yeah i mean for some people that's just you know that's out of the question you know if you give it subtitled they won't watch it yeah  okay um i i guess um you know i really i remember what school was like when i grew up and uh you know back then i believe i really do believe people had more respect for teachers back then well that's what i was thinking the discipline just isn't there anymore like it used to be um-hum um-hum and they've lost the teachers have lost control yeah i agree and i don't know i you know i think some of that stems with the parents but well i think so too i i think some of it also stems from just society in general because teachers aren't looked looked upon as uh you know like with as much respect as they use the to be that's right because back then you know if you were a teacher people used to think oh you know that you know that's great and nowadays if you're a teacher it's like oh you had nothing else that you could come up with to do so you decided to go into teaching yeah well they didn't used to sue the teachers like they're doing now and that's why why the teachers are in so much trouble you know it's like yeah that too that's true that's true that's really too bad that the teachers don't have have control over the students like they used to yeah that's true yeah my wife's a teacher but she teaches preschool and see the um parents used to back up the teachers too they would sit they would tell the kids now you do what your teacher says um-hum um-hum that's right and the teacher would let them know if they weren't doing the right thing and the parents would be right there on the kids but that's right and it seems to me like now it's just the opposite in in a in a lot of cases you know the that's right that's right parents are behind their kids now and they believe the things that they say about the teachers so right um-hum yeah i i don't know how they would correct it yeah yeah and i also don't believe that you know uh you know physical punishment is is really the answer either uh no i don't believe that either uh because you know a lot of kids you know they get that at home you know they don't need it at school either they need some other way of right of discipline that's you know it's going to uh more or less snap you know snap the child around and and get them you know just just earn some respect right you know anybody can beat up on anybody else well they should just for the discipline at school they should just uh take away some of their things that they enjoy the most yeah yeah i guess it really would i mean doesn't matter what age the the child is you know anywhere from preschool to you know teenagers you know you take away what they what they want and enjoy then they're going to pay attention to you right right that's true i have a sister that's a first grade teacher she teaches first grade um-hum um-hum and she just she thoroughly enjoys the kids she really likes them yes yes yeah and i'm gonna i'm going back to school i'm gonna start back in January get my teaching certificate i'm gonna teach high school ooh you're brave i'm gonna be a home economics teacher ah you know i i think maybe it might not be too bad of an idea you you i don't know if you've seen the movie where the the principal cracks down on the kids and he says okay let me know who all the trouble makers are and they're out of here and i'm wondering how practical that is to apply to you know to all the schools it's yeah i mean i wonder if that would work or not or what kind of alternative they could provide for these you know troubled kids and trouble makers that type of thing well you know the main there's a big really another big problem and that's the drop out problem now all the kids are dropping out and i think it's because the parents don't tell them they can't um-hum yeah that's right parents don't don't um you know the kids say well i don't want to do that anymore and then the parents say well okay whatever you think and that's what that wasn't that way when i was a kid yeah that's true uh and we'd say why do we have to do that and the parent would say because i told you so and you do what i say see they found they've right right they've uh lost whoever's supposed to take charge here yeah it it's getting to the point where you know where well you know it's kind of with both parents having to work it's really hard to uh that has a lot to do with it too uh-huh they can't watch over their kids anymore like they used to uh to have the strength yeah yeah and then when mom and dad do give notice at home then you know they're too tired from working all day long they just assume let them do whatever they want and neat yeah don't bother me i'm tired uh-huh yeah it's really too bad and that doesn't help either that's true because it depends on what they do in school as how they're going to do their future things in life yeah that's true especially i think at the younger ages uh elementary you know i i think maybe you know i hate to say you know one teacher teaching a certain grade is is higher priority than another teacher but you know so much of of what they experience in their early years oh that's right they need the basics too in the education they need that reading and writing sets a pattern um-hum um  okay oh okay what kind of music are you interested in i'm basically into uh oh just rock and roll uh uh-huh uh jazz i'm a little bit of everything jazz reggae rock uh uh-huh i'm more into the i'm see i'm twenty three so i'm you know i used to be in a band and hang around all that stuff but i'm so oh pretty much into more classic rock now probably you know Clapton Lynyrd Skynyrd uh-huh oh so but uh i'm also into you know jazz and stuff and uh-huh so you like the hits of today you're not really interested into do you i'm not into uh the dance stuff but uh uh-huh oh i so what are you into right now well well one of my favorite things is is this time of the year is Christmas music i love Christmas music all kinds i like you know the the children's songs like Frosty the Snowman and course i have children so they like that too and um-hum right and i like also like the you know the religious type Christmas songs and i just love the the music this time of the the year and i also i like country a little bit of country you probably don't like country sounds like uh i like some Clint Black some you know some Garth uh do you yeah i've gotten into that more lately the last few years i i used used to just totally not even listen to it but all my friends are into it so you know it's just oh uh-huh uh-huh yeah i'm pretty much handle anything you know oh that's good Christmas music yeah around Christmas sure uh-huh yeah so that's but uh that's good i it just depends but i'll probably say rock you know for your favorite not heavy metal so much anymore but yeah uh-huh i kind of grew grew out of that it's a little irritating now i guess i see why my parents didn't like it when i was yeah is it in junior high but no that's about how it goes oh yeah they can't understand the words the heck's going on yeah so did you do you listen to your music loud do you like it loud or no just regular when i was a kid probably but uh-huh uh-huh it's just not i don't irritate anybody with it yeah uh-huh well that's i you know when i said i liked the country i i don't like the real heavy country like the you know crying all but just the just the light country stuff and i also like um i like a lot of contemporary music i i like all kinds of music i even like classical i have that playing you know once in a while in the background here at home and um right enjoy that so do you go to concerts or yeah as a matter of fact uh the other day here i was um i was downtown uh a sale call working and um um-hum Van Halen i don't know you might see this in the news they put on a free concert um-hum oh and out on calls and we just happened to be about about a mile away so we went down there to the uh West End District which is uh real nice um downtown area which is a big hang out for a lot of tourists and stuff so they put it on and um oh uh-huh it was unannounced type thing and they announced it like two hours before the show and um we just happened to be down there and oh oh wow well that's nice it was a little riot almost broke out so it was we happened to be in a restaurant across the street you know nice seats but oh really yeah i used to do the concert thing when i was younger but i mean it's just uh-huh now i mean you want to lose your hearing yeah God i mean it's just i used to go out with my friends and stuff in high school and too a lot of money too oh really oh yeah but oh huh just it's not i don't know i mean with the prices and you know thirty five dollar ticket and there's there's not really that yeah anybody i really want to see for that much amount of money now you know no not for them that's right do you play a musical instrument no i don't even i was in a band in junior high i played baritone but oh that wasn't you haven't haven't kept that up that was just more or less you know for the heck of it uh-huh oh well that's good i i played piano a little bit and i how to be a well well a well rounded individual i guess so oh well i i hadn't even thought about that since uh oh well if there's i guess there's still chance but you do like to listen to music you do enjoy it and oh yeah oh yeah i do too i do too i think it's really really powerful it can make a strong a lot of lot of strong statements um-hum trying to i hope my kids will be interested in i'd love for them to play in a marching band i like the music from marching bands you know in parades as they're going by i i enjoy the drums and the trumpets and all that kind of stuff so i guess i like all most all kinds of music and yeah my uh ex-girlfriend's dad used to be in a a drum corp or whatever oh did he back in and they were from up north i guess it's real big up there oh they're from Wisconsin and oh that's one thing he he was always really into that i just remember it well that's interesting i've never heard a drum corp in person did had did you hear any of hear him play at all or uh i'd seen some they have these competitions like once a year out here i know it's just drum corps that come out and i've never been to one but i mean i know it's i guess they just have th eir uh oh  okay i said Arlington Texas because the other day i was talking to somebody and he was in Arlington Virginia yeah yeah that's the only one i've gotten out of this area oh no oh gosh oh gosh i look well anyway we've got a easy subject yes we do you can go ahead first if you'd like okay let me think here favorite shows i haven't been watching much TV lately i used to yeah you know you get so busy yeah i have uh let's see i have one favorite soap opera i still watch and i tape if i'm not home and uh oh let's see that's General Hospital and then uh at night i don't um when i sit down i don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock when my kids get in bed and i know and and uh then i watch uh what do i watch at nine o'clock let's see oh well Tuesday nights i guess we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like and uh right are they little i have a seven year old and a ten year old yeah they're pretty young and uh so we usually catch uh Full House and uh what's the one comes on after that it's a new one um i don't know my kids are older so i don't i don't know some of those shows now like i used to yeah three something uh-huh yeah yeah uh other than that uh oh gosh i watch Knots Landing on Thursday nights for pure entertainment nothing else yeah right well i like i like the comedies they're just light too i have to watch Murphy Brown i really like oh now that is a good one that is a good one if i'm home on Mondays then i i definitely watch her i make a point of that i love that and i really like Coach i think it's when it's good it's just a scream yeah yeah well he's such a good actor he really is good uh well he's probably playing himself half the time you see these people on an interview show they're they act just like they do in their parts he i saw him on Johnny Carson once and he acted just about the same yeah yeah oh gosh well he could very well be so do you watch much TV or yeah and uh well i watch more now because well i i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy uh-huh but this semester i'm only taking one course and so i see Murphy Brown and Coach and The Wonder Years i just make a point of seeing those now i never see that oh i've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show oh it's fabulous really you should never miss that it they are just gems of shows i mean they're really uh fabulous in every way oh gosh what now what night is that on now oh that's Wednesday at uh seven thirty Wednesday at seven thirty oh okay yeah Wednesdays i i go to church choir so that's my one night out and about so oh yeah sure yeah well maybe your maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime just so you get the idea it wouldn't take much wouldn't take much to get hooked on those yeah i should get him to do that because i know yeah yeah uh-oh so so i watch those and are there any new ones this year that came out that you like or well you know i haven't oh yeah we started watching Northern Exposure well it's not really new but it's still kind of new and uh-huh uh-huh how's that i haven't seen that i like it a lot it's real different in fact they never thought it would be a hit huh i mean they'll have some things in there that almost almost you know like supernatural or something you know i mean somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does or i mean it sounds weird but it's it's a very very uh unique show and very well done excellent actors ah huh i'll have to watch for that one sometime i i guess we just it came on after something we used to watch uh-huh uh-huh and i guess we just kept sitting there and then now we make a point of watching i can't take all these shows on because next semester i'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television so gosh uh-oh well then it will be mostly reruns i guess it's uh by the end of February the way they do it nowadays yeah yeah um gosh well we used to watch a lot of Designing Women but uh i haven't seen that much lately since they got rid of uh Delta Burke and brought on the new ones but um yeah yeah i've seen that was she the was she the best one was she the best one on that old show oh she was just funny she was really funny and her character was good i don't know that it was her in particular it was just the character so um really right right yeah they had a big fight on that show didn't they they were all accusing each other of everything in the world yeah yeah oh that was awful and who knows still what happened really happened you know well i know you know gosh you never will probably yeah yeah well well i think the latest soap opera for people is the Kennedy trial for those who have cable i don't have cable oh i know now i told was gonna no we don't have that station either so uh i haven't been able to catch any of that but just what little we caught on the news i mean it's just as wild as any soap opera from what i hear on the news and i think he's guilty as the devil oh i know it well i don't see how he couldn't be you know i know what's in it for her is there's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that because you know they tear you to shreds especially those rich high powered lawyers yeah that's right oh and they said this lawyer is unbelievable but they said she held up so well yesterday um i know everybody was saying that and then in the paper said it so it should be interesting yeah oh gosh well the National Enquirer says i was reading that in the supermarket line i never have the nerve to buy the thing uh oh shoot well do you watch any uh any sports or anything like that or says he hum no i don't care anything about that because i don't either i can't i can't watch it on TV so uh um i like the ice skating you know occasionally some ice skating will come on on a Sunday or the during the Olympics i always watch that i think it's so beautiful uh-huh yeah i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes too oh yeah that's good it might just to  i've done more painting than i want to talk about in my uh in my time i had a uh um three bedroom two and a half bath two story town house in Atlanta about ten years ago that i started i was just going to touch up paint in a couple of rooms before it was over i wound up painting the entire thing because the more i did it the worse it made everything else look the rest look so anyway but that included ceilings walls woodwork and everything and and you know i found out number one i can do it you know and i was i was really pleased with the results after it was finally finished but gosh it was a lot of work yeah but you feel good about it when you've done it yourself and you do save a lot of money yeah you really do yeah but it's a mess and it's hard to find the time uh-huh it is and well i was fortunate at the time i had a job that uh i uh yes it was restrictly an eight hour job and uh so i but that really cut my social life out for gosh i don't know about a month and a half it seems like all i did i mean every spare minute i had a paint brush in my hand or a roller uh-huh but like you say it it made a difference and it really increased the value of my property when i sold it i'm sure oh yeah oh yeah it does yeah i've painted inside i haven't painted outside and that's what i need done now yeah well my brother and sister-in-law in Austin uh are just finishing painting the entire outside of their house their house is almost all wood but um and what a lot of work that was and they had to scrape it and then yeah that's the work yeah that's it yeah and then putty and caulk and paint and i was up there about a month ago and what they had done looked marvelous but i mean the work was tremendous yeah yeah i don't think i'll attempt that myself i i know i won't yeah i'll hire somebody to do that but in fact i had a workman here for a leak that he had to fix and yeah for ten dollars he was willing to paint my daughter's ceiling so i said go ahead you paint the ceiling and then i'll do the walls and that was that was nice listen you got a great bargain for ten for ten dollars let yeah for ten dollars he was saying he was chatting and we were having a good old time so he just said all right ten dollars i'll do the ceiling uh-huh i that's incredible i because painting the ceilings is absolutely the worst thing and and especially yeah it is especially so so many ceilings have this horrible you know this horrible texture that's just like you know popcorn blown right right well hers didn't it was just a smooth ceiling but yeah but but the place that i had in Atlanta that i wound up painting the ceilings everywhere it had a pretty pretty much a lot of texture on and it just was a nightmare to paint and i just you know i yeah just i i got it now i accumulated a lot of drop cloths and i had my painting gear that you know the same clothes i'd just throw them in the washer and you know wear them again and pretty soon they were just you know tie-dyed with paint yeah but you know painting the ceiling if it's not smooth can really be a nightmare oh yeah i have that in my living room and dining room but we had a leak and the insurance company's gonna pay to do the whole area wow that's good so that's gonna be a good deal i won't have to worry about that yeah what was so funny with my my brother and sister-in-law in in Austin when they started uh talking about you know they knew they needed to paint their house and they got some estimates and they were just you know exorbitant so they started going around and and looking at paint colors and they must have looked at five hundred different paint chips and then they finally settled on white white oh no oh no uh but you know there again i you can't go wrong with your good basic white yeah i guess i i think i'll go with an off-white uh-huh i'm changing everything so well that was the other thing too after i painted then i had to go in and uh change the window treatments because i you know got rid of some old uh uh wallpaper and you know so it went you know not only the paint but i wound up doing quite a few things so uh and changed out some lighting and and so forth and so on put some dimmers in um-hum yeah yeah it's all challenging that's for sure i've the whole year it's taking me to redecorate my bedroom and my daughter's bedroom um-hum but it's pretty i love it i've upholstered walls and made curtains and who did did you do the walls i did yeah um-hum did you really i'm impressed and it looks so nice because you just take sheets and then everything can match huh and it looks really pretty i love it it's just real feminine and just real pretty yeah i like wall upholstery but uh that's something i would never even dream of so oh it's easy oh if you can do all that you could do walls oh there's nothing to it really huh you can do a wall in half an hour you're kidding huh-uh staple gun is all it takes oh okay did you put anything behind the sheet i did i put the batting uh-huh and just staple it up there and staple your sheets up and then yeah uh-huh and that's all it is to it yeah and then you can glue a little edge around if you want to like i took some eyelet lace and i just hot glued it around the edge yeah well but it's nothing and it's just beautiful i love it well i'll be well i'll have to keep that in mind i i just i don't after just do the rest and  okay well what do you think about it uh well immigration i know they're really strict right now because my hundred husband is from out of the country and uh we had to go through a whole very long process to uh to assure the government that he was uh marrying me and not to be a resident here um-hum that's interesting yeah i think that's uh i think it's a little crazy i worked with Spanish people uh-huh for about two years and just it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers yeah that's true i mean you can't just come over to the country because uh you want to right you know that's not good enough you have to have a have to have a darn good reason of political or whatever right exactly it's not a good not a good easy way to get in yeah i think you know i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to to protect you know the people who are in the states exactly my mother uh actually knew a woman uh in another state that used to marry men just never she'd never even meet them and she'd just get money for it uh-huh oh you're kidding huh-uh so uh sounds like a lot of fun yeah it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow uh to occur before you know you can come in and exactly but i mean with the new laws it's really it's tough now right yeah it's kind of frustrating too for those who are legitimate now you know i think exactly well and you know uh my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life you know and they got here but now it's a you know it's so strict that you you can't just do that uh-huh right exactly and i think it's important that they you know they allow a good number of people in every year because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that that we don't want to do i agree and i just i don't know i have personally i have a problem with it i think that you know if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that exactly if they're not going to be on welfare or or whatever they're going to be a productive citizen we shouldn't close our door yeah and you know i i believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when you you know send them back to their country yeah but and i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in and well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh you know sent back to Mexico just to find their way back yeah and that's that's what i think you know i i have to laugh because like i said i worked with a lot of those and they'd been deported two or three times and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for Christmas that's right that's our money or for any other time yes that's true but i think you know i think all in all there's a lot of improvements i think the general idea is good but but there could be some work done in the area i i think i agree i agree well good yeah anyway do you have anything else in the the subject uh that you might want to talk about uh boy this is spur of the moment um uh but i i don't really see any any uh changes that i think are really blatant right now other than i think they ought to take you know on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a um political refugee yeah absolutely i think a lot of times we take you know basically who we want to because if you if you have connections it's a lot easier to get in exactly connections and money yeah and i think you know it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent you know yeah and that it should be equal to all and then not like the United States basically it's not who you know it doesn't it doesn't become a thing of who you know but but how the type of person you are and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people like probably your husband can get in i agree yeah well we got him past that but uh there's i know there's a lot of other people out there well great would probably do a good job here yep well let's see is there anything i believe in i think that's it is this like a very short call no i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be but i've enjoyed it it's good hearing your your point of view and i think that's neat i think we agree a lot on that and that's true i've learned something from it well it was nice talking to you well thanks i'm glad you're home you have a good evening all right you too thanks bye-bye bye-bye  okay what kind of car would you uh would you buy if you were going to by one these days uh that uh to be real honest i'm thinking about a truck as opposed to a car what kind of truck um uh uh probably some sort of utility type vehicle either a um my my particular favorite right at the moment is that Explorer the Ford um Explorer oh i i think that's pretty good i uh i got to look for something too i i unfortunately i have a Ford Thunderbird that uh it's been in the shop for three days and they can't fix the thing so i'm not real happy with Ford at the moment right i think i will try some other line oh some other brand or something yeah no i just am i have looked for a long time i've i've had since i've been out of school i've mostly had uh you know German cars like um i had i mean you know used ones obviously um i had a Mercedes sedan and then i had a BMW how how did those work how long did they last you they well they're excellent cars and if you uh my uh i was a little partial to the Mercedes i think i almost wish i'd kept it it was old it was by the time i sold it it was about fifteen thirteen or fifteen years old how many miles you get on it oh jeez um ah did you get a couple hundred thousand at least i mean the the the year model that i had was one that that um they say that those engines are built to be completely torn down and rebuilt like at least three times really hm that's the amount of metal that they have in them yeah that Mercedes really i mean the way look at a car is they built you know they build this car you buy this car you can drive this car your whole life maybe that's the kind of car i better buy i drive too many miles i uh i drive about thirty five thousand miles a year and uh American cars i guess just don't do that kind of mileage i think they don't build them to hold up to that for something well well i think the cars do i don't think they have mechanics that can fix them that's the whole problem yeah that's probably and all this computerized stuff is fine and good but you know something goes wrong and and it seems like yep you know it's like yeah yeah you can't fix anything anymore you have to replace entire parts or something you know you can't you know back in the olden days well they can't fix it they don't they don't have the no yeah where where do you live what city do you live in i live in Dallas you live in Dallas well you got the same problem with mechanics i think they i i just don't think there's good mechanics around yeah yeah i mean i don't know i i do a lot of stuff myself because it seems like if you take something to a dealership you know they are even more inclined to not fix something and just like replace the entire part i think you're right and and and they don't seem to really know how to do anything else you know what i call parts changers and and so i get myself a little book and i start fixing a lot of stuff myself want to fix my Thunderbird they can't fix it yeah if it's a very new one i wouldn't even begin to you know all this computer stuff just loses me i don't like to look under the engine of the car and not see anything i recognize you know that's the problem i agree with you used to be you could you could repair and do all those things yourself and there's there's so much pollution i i think the antipollution stuff is what really fouls up a lot of engines oh yeah and uh there's there's no way you can work on them yeah i i think because the whole system wasn't designed with that in mind in the first place so they just came up with something they could slap on after the fact yep that's right you know i mean if if if you really wanted to i mean you know if we can send people to the moon we can sure have engineers that can sit down and design a fairly efficient engine that would also be good for the environment i think they can it's just that but the you know there's no percentages in doing that there's too much i mean they can make too much money doing the doing the other way around or something that's why the electric car has has been made for some time but uh there's too much politics and too much gas and oil people that will prevent that from coming on the market for the time being i'm afraid and i'll tell you you know the thing i worry about is that's strictly short term i mean that you know we know that our oil supply is running out you know and what happens when it does is what i want to know yeah then they bring it on board i mean i may not have to worry about it because it happen in my lifetime but i worry about it anyway because i know it's out there i don't know it's just well we can always go back to horses well that's you know least you don't have to worry about maintaining them this well this is true you could just like have them out there i don't know in the pasture grazing and there's not much fixing with them either i don't know i don't know that i'd want to have to rely on that as my transportation but i don't know i just you know i've been looking at at some things and like i say i've been looking at these Explorers and these other kind of you know Blazers and whatnot and you know they open up the hood and they say you know it you think they last a long time i don't know they but they say they open up the hood they show you all these modern advances they've made and they show  okay you don't have any children no we were never blessed with children um we had a foster child for a while and we're real active oh oh in church with some of the young people uh-huh i hear i heard one of yours oh yes yes we have four and they range in ages from eight until the youngest is eight months so so you have a considerable range of of interests and activities and so forth right we do and when they were speaking about some of the activities that you like to participate in as a family one of our very favorite is reading we love to read read with our children and to them and and so far they've been they've grown up with a love for reading too and we're very glad about that that's terrific you know that's not i've i've observed that that's not done enough these year these days oh yeah when we had our foster son he was um uh two and a half to three and a half that that year in there and we read every night because we just felt like that was important to spend time oh uh-huh oh with him there's so little time one-on-one time these days with mechanical or or the electronic uh games and and TV and so forth to draw folks away boy i'll say right boy i'll say that's right my with our well where with all of them we start right from the time they were born and and spent time reading with them and and they seem they enjoy it the kids will get the books and bring to us and say you know let's read a book did they have them memorized and and know if you're skipping a page uh yeah they do they do did you experience that too yes it it on nights when it was already really late and i'd try to short circuit it it was no no no uh-huh and they catch on pretty quick you mentioned TV watching watching too much TV and i i feel that's a real big problem also i i think that there's just too much of that it's used too much as a babysitter and and i totally agree people just plop the kids down in front of it and now there are some wonderful programs for children and when i had our foster son i was babysitting i had that's right um-hum four under the age of three and we ended up using television couple times a day when Sesame Street was on oh wow uh-huh to entertain them but also to do some learning things and then we re-enforced that then with with some of the things that we were involved in if i was in the kitchen and and so forth the little girl wanted to emulate everything i did right oh oh uh-huh and so and we talked about the letters and numbers and so fourth so we used it as a tool uh-huh right but not i won't say i was perfect it wasn't ever used as a babysitter while i was busy with one of the others but oh that's right that's right and then i can't say say that either but then like you say there's some good shows on it and there's some good videos also that you can rent that are yes you know real helpful and um we also like to play with our kids i one of one of our other favorite things to do is to have pillow fights with them and they really enjoy that they laugh and you know it's winter here and it's hard to get outside and do a lot of oh lot of outdoor physical type things and so i hadn't thought about that yeah so we we do pillow fights and um course just play with them play games and um when you were growing up did you spend time did your family camp or or what other activities we did we went camping and then Richard and i did that all through our our twenty years together too so it was something that carried over from both our backgrounds and into into our current life oh uh-huh oh that's great your your pillow fights reminded me though that when when i was growing up um uh we we spent four years in Utah and then we went from there to Germany and and it was even further north uh-huh uh-huh oh boy i'll bet and uh daddy used to roughhouse in the winter time with us we'd get on the floor and just you know play play play tickle games and and and hug and cuddle and that was important to do that bonding and i never thought of that till you mentioned the pillow fights uh-huh uh-huh oh it is oh but we'd get everybody involved in that well it was just my brother and i and we thoroughly enjoyed that that time spent with daddy that we didn't get to see him very much at all uh-huh boy i'll say i'll say you do and and i think like you say the bonding and the physical you know loving and touching that's that's very important i feel like so um do you have outside the home activities that that you do with the the family yes we do we well like i say we the little community we live in it's winter a lot of time so we go sleigh riding and the kids love that they love there's yeah oh several hills close by that we that are kind of designated sleigh riding hills and and we take the tubes you know the tubes and toboggans and and go and do that in the winter and in the summer um oh bike riding and we go well we've we've each got a bike with the little one we haven't done it this last summer as much because she's just so so tiny that um-hum we didn't get a chance but um we've got the swings and had a trampoline  did they mention our topic yes vacation spots okay right anything anything in the area of types of vacations you've been on lately you've really enjoyed well i i guess probably my favorite thing to do is to go to the beach um and my most favorite place to do that is San Diego uh i love San Diego very much but this past summer we went to um Gulf Shores Alabama and had a great time there uh-huh the beach was beautiful and and that was really uh a nice place to go so that's that's probably one of my most favorite places to go how about you well i'm a lot the same way we uh i was raised well West Virginia but also Virginia and i spent an awful a lot of time on the Virginia Beach area and i sort of love the water i've always loved the ocean so i enjoy going to the beaches myself as far as a favorite beach um probably Myrtle Beach is as as more of a younger person i haven't been there for years i'd like to go back and see how it has changed but i enjoy Myrtle Beach i enjoy Padre Island right here in Texas but i enjoy pretty much any beaches uh-huh i've i've heard that Myrtle Beach is wonderful i have friends who think that that's the best place in the world i've i've never been myself but uh you know i've heard that it's a wonderful place to go well i haven't been right haven't been for twenty years myself but oh one of these days i'll go back and see how nice it is i'm sure it's just as nice as ever as a as a high schooler and a college kid it was a great place to go it was the big weekend place and things like that especially in the summer the place to go in the summer to get a yeah sure you know a summer job and to spend your dollars and uh have fun and everything sure well also one of my i was thinking another one of my favorite places is uh Santa Fe uh have you ever been to Santa Fe New Mexico no i haven't well it's wonderful oh i'll bet it is yeah it really is a beautiful place and for the past two falls i've gone there i've made two trips to Santa Fe it's sort of becoming an annual thing for me uh i go by myself i go without my family and uh if what do you do uh pardon what do you do while you're there well i basically uh i love to visit churches there are wonderful churches in Santa Fe it's a real uh it's just a wonderful area and this past year i went to a fabulous uh monastery uh-huh right uh that's out in the desert uh out in the hills of Santa Fe i also went to one of the Indian pueblos this past year and that was just wonderful yeah my wife would probably enjoy i mean enjoy we'd probably enjoy that also are you Catholic no i'm not okay we're we're Catholics so we'd we'd definitely definitely enjoy all the old churches oh you'd really enjoy it then well you would love it because i have a very great appreciation for uh the Catholic church and for Catholic churches and all the ones i visit are Catholic uh right one of the places that i went to is a little place town called Tamayo it's out of Santa Fe uh-huh and they have there's a sanctuary there there was supposed to be some uh miracle healing that occurred there and it is just a fabulous place i i i just love Tamayo and it's about thirty minutes north of of Santa Fe and oh no kidding we'll have to maybe give that a try sometime well i'd highly recommend it particularly if you're Catholic i think you'd have a great appreciation for it if you're a a water person my wife still says the best vacation we ever went on with our kids and as a family was we went to one of the Jack Tarr Villages in the Caribbean and we went to one the one located at Puerto Plata did you Puerto Plata and you know that's the most reasonable vacation we were ever on we just opened the paper one morning four or five years ago and it said round trip all included seven days hotel food all you could drink just every party everything it was almost like a cruise ah uh-huh but uh it was like five ninety nine so we said let's do it so we packed up everyone four of us plus my son's girlfriend we all went and it's probably not like i said not only the most reasonable vacation we were ever on and everything was paid for it was just glorious i mean the water was fantastic you get they had pools they had beaches people were so courteous the lodging was fantastic the food was just like being on a cruise ship huh everything from Baked Alaska right on down and all this for five hundred and ninety nine dollars it was uh-huh i mean that's unbelievable the price oh it is unbelievable and we keep saying that one of these days our kids are getting older now they're in college and uh be getting married and whatever so we doubt we'll ever have the opportunity to go back with our with our kids but but we're certainly going back but with your kids that's probably one place that we really enjoyed now that didn't include your airfare did it that included everything airfare lodging every meal i mean if you were a heavy drinker you could sit there and drink twenty five or thirty drinks a day or whatever you wanted i mean just it was everything gosh good grief and it was just a a Caribbean type of surrounding very tropical just uh entertainment every night i don't know if you've ever been a cruise ship or not but it was exactly like being on a cruise ship yeah i've been on a cruise ship and we were on four cruises and uh  okay go ahead well i i live we're gonna compare notes um i uh i yeah myself often desire to exercise often believe i should and rarely do don't do it well i tell you i i firmly believe in exercising i think it's a i do it everyday on a regular basis i what what what sort of of regiment do you have well i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles but this time of year you can't get much biking in uh um-hum but every morning i use this President's uh council of physical fitness and it really is um-hum uh uh it's worth doing and you can do it anywhere i i travel quite a bit in my in my business and you can do it yes you know wherever you're at and if you do it i i do it every morning after uh usually after breakfast before i take a shower and get you know dressed going you know to go to work yes um-hum and uh now what i do i mean i've done this for you know like fifteen years so you don't start at this kind of regiment you know i so what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do and because you'll hurt yourself yes uh every every uh you know it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time but i uh i do twenty five um uh what where you have your arms above your head and and your body twisters touch you know left and right toe um-hum right then i do uh ten uh right and left uh trunk twisters um-hum and i do uh about sixty uh uh you know bicycle type uh leg thrust type things um-hum and i do uh twenty uh leg lifters on each side you know when you're prone laying on the floor yes yes right and then i do fifty push-ups and do a hundred sit ups and uh then i do about uh my goodness you do all of this in fifteen minutes oh yeah oh yeah and then uh thirty uh now if you did football like like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you you know prone type things where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing um-hum but that takes about really about maybe about thirteen minutes uh you know in the morning to do it but yeah now what what keeps you doing that i mean i i sometimes start start little much less much more modest efforts but i give up i just find them boring and hard to well um find time for it on a given day and years ago i used to uh referee football and uh to stay in condition i did that uh just as a normal basis and uh uh yes yes i tell you just by doing it uh well example this summer i i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be so i i increased i do three hundred sit ups a day now but not at that in the morning i do a hundred then and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed i lost fifteen pounds um-hum just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles and you can you know you can eat anything you want drink anything you want but you don't you know within within reason you know you can lose weight or maintain your weight and your physical your physical being and uh yes um-hum yeah i just you know you're ready to go at a i i i think it's really important well i i i whenever i do it i feel good yeah i mean good that i have done good because it's it seems right and good because it has good effects but but it's this maintaining a a regular habit that i just can't seem to do well well that's why Chuck i think uh if you did it on a daily basis and you didn't need elaborate things you know where you can make excuses like yeah yeah well i i like biking and during summer i'll do you know at least seventy five miles a week and when i really was doing it maybe a hundred and fifty but you can't um-hum um-hum you know there's excuses the weather or you don't have time or something like that yeah but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning just like brushing your teeth you're gonna spend fifteen minutes or a half hour and you get up a half hour earlier um-hum um-hum and once you start getting into that one you just feel good and you look a whole lot better yes yes do you do you does your wife participate in any of this or unfortunately not and there's no way i can get her to so it's a like it's something you either just really want to do it or you can't talk anyone into it if you don't like to exercise you know it isn't going to happen but um-hum yes yes i i sure wish she would she's you know unfortunately overweight and but she's a wonderful woman and you know no sense getting in arguments with her anybody about it um-hum yeah yeah well i uh i uh i keep saying if somebody else would do it with me i that would be a little bit of peer pressure would help considerably well but you seemed to have solved solved that problem without any any external no problem at all and uh if you get one of these mats you know go to a store they normally have these exercise things these ABCs of physical fitness on them help yes my one of my kids got me one of those for Christmas one year and uh what what what what's on what's this mat i mean in it it it's just an exercise mat that rolls up so you can put it out you know just in the corner is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip and sleep on it i mean it's that it's that kind of like half inch of foam or something well yeah you can do that but but it doesn't yeah yeah it's a foam thing yeah yeah and it's it's just about six feet long it rolls up yeah yeah and i don't take it on trips with me i you could but uh i don't mind uh you know if i do like sit ups i'll throw a a towel down or something and you know so you don't have the abrasive yeah  no i used to have a cat when my kids were little oh really i had him for about seven years oh what kind was he well the they called him a tabby cat okay do you have any pets yeah i got a dog it's how long have you had him uh oh she's about she'll be three in February oh she yeah yeah well her name's Sam because it's like short for Samantha and everybody calls her him that's what i called my cat was Sammy really ha how about that same names yeah do you let your dog in the house yeah yeah she's about forty five pounds or so yeah yeah she's about medium sized dog she like one of the family oh yeah oh yeah yeah you get up from your chair and she hops in and you never have the heart to kick her out because she's too friendly when you go on trips do you take her with you yeah yeah she loves to go in car she's pretty good too yeah yeah she just curls up in the back and falls asleep yeah i think dogs are less destructive than cats cats tear up your furniture you know that's the only thing i hated about my cat he yeah well she sheds a lot oh yeah so we're we're constantly sweeping and brushing yeah well she doesn't like to be brushed though oh that's too bad yeah i know you brush her and and she walks away yeah that's unusual most of them really they like those so we don't brush her much yeah that's what i hear but she doesn't those brushes yeah she can play Frisbee pretty good though oh yeah yeah she loves to chase things Frisbee or ball or anything we have a lake up here in the middle of town and went last summer i went up there and there was a dog chasing i mean catching a Frisbee and he was really good uh yeah they'd throw it and he'd be right there on it did he ever go into the lake no some of them do though yeah i don't think Sam would she's afraid of water she's afraid of water yeah she hates baths and she hates the rain boy yeah a lot of those dogs they they'll you know if they're after a stick or or a Frisbee and they throw it in the lake they'll just jump in there after it yeah i've never tried that with her there's a couple like parks around here with lakes but they don't let pets in oh i see so she's never had the opportunity but i don't think she would no not if she didn't like water yeah well it's like the first time she might not knowing it was water but then she'd learn what kind is she she's a Shepherd and Husky oh i'll bet she's pretty yeah what color is she uh brown and black oh yeah i'll bet she's pretty yeah it's like that's that's she looks really puppy like too yeah yeah the top of her is all blackish and then she gets lighter as you go down yeah i like animals i live in an apartment now but so i don't like to have animals in an apartment yeah we're i'm in an apartment now too and i'm the same way but it's kind of like out in the middle of nowhere there's big trees and fields so we can go out and run oh oh well that's different see i'm right in town yeah oh yeah that's got to be hard no yard or anything and you i think if you have pets you really need yards yeah you've got to have one or a place that where they can run yeah this is like one of the few apartments apartments around here that takes pets everybody here has a dog or a cat or a rabbit or something yeah yeah so they always play together yeah they ask for those big deposits for those pets too yeah yeah but she's worth it she's a good little dog i have a boyfriend and he has this duplex and he's he rented it out to these people that had a i don't know had one or two dogs and they just they ruined the whole thing oh really they wouldn't go outside to go the bathroom they ruined the carpet and everything oh i bet they stained all over it oh they did it was awful so he had to rip up all the carpet and throw it away they ruined it ooh yeah we've never had a problem with Sam because we'll go to work in the day and leave her and she'll just sleep all day and not make a mess yeah so i guess we're pretty lucky in that way yeah well it depends on the people too that make their pets mind yeah yeah i guess if you care about them they'll be better pets yeah well when now when he rents he says no pets when he rents to people because of that one experience he had where they ruined the carpeting uh yeah that's too bad though too a lot of people with pets need a place to live yeah yeah so how's Pennsylvania is it cold over there today yeah it's getting there pretty cold oh well it's really nice here yeah i bet it is except it's windy if the wind wasn't blowing it'd be really nice oh oh we got the wind and the cold up here yeah well it's it's uh it's pretty warm but it's real windy and it's cloudy ooh sounds like here except colder yeah i like the sun to shine yeah i'm waiting for it to snow some because uh Sam really likes the snow we take her outside and throw snow balls at her she catch them all well i'm surprised if she doesn't like water yeah she doesn't like when it's raining she hates to go out when it's raining but if it's snowing  well what do you like to read uh i read about just anything that i can get my hands on you sound like me if it's printed i'll read it exactly yeah it's amazing to me the people that uh i've i've got a brother and sister-in-law that uh like whenever i go to visit them i'll always have to be sure and carry a book with me because there's nothing to read in their house and i go crazy yeah i i pretty much carry my own reading material too i mean i'll uh i'll be walking to work i mean walking to the elevator to work and i'll be reading a book on the way up in the elevator and everybody laughs at me you know yeah well i i went to the library yesterday looking around and i found this uh new book by PJ O'Rourke called uh uh Parliament of Horrors and it's about uh um-hum it's a humorous humorous attence attempts to explain the entire US government and it's really cute hm but anyway he wrote for Rolling Stone magazine for years and years i think he still does uh-huh is it a is it a satire or it is very much a satire uh-huh yeah well i like i said i i i gosh i can't remember the last book i bought but i've read so many and any book my mother usually has a stack at her house so i'll go and pick up one over there and or several actually and just get through them one by one mostly i like i don't know i suppose uh mystery or history true history yeah that type of thing most ladies do like mysteries a lot i have i have a friend too is a voracious history buff she just she reads one history yeah um-hum book after another and and i was telling her about the library here in Houston that has uh one particular library that has all of the mysteries arranged in one area uh and then another one that while they're not arranged in one area they do they have question marks on the covers to indicate that they're mysteries and she said oh that sounds like heaven to her so she wouldn't have to have to look for them um-hum that's true no i can't say that i've been to the library lately i've found quite a bit i mean i'm either reading a newspaper or a magazine or like i said anything i can get my hands on yeah the only problem that i've got now is that uh i take a daily paper and then i've got oh i don't know four or five magazines coming in and then of course i've always usually i'm in the middle of two or three different books at the same time exactly and i've found lately that uh that i i feel God for some reason i feel kind of bad about it but i'm not able to get through the newspaper i mean and i and and then if i'm not finished with it i don't want to throw it away and then all of a sudden it's the next day and then it's the next day uh uh-hum my kitchen counter is covered with magazines newspapers so i finally just you know make a run to the dumpster yeah but i uh i well i end up just picking out key sections and reading those and the rest of it if i get to it fine if not hm yeah yeah the only really the only the only day that i just uh devour it cover to cover is on Sunday but that's sort of a ritual with me get the coffee and a bran muffin and the newspaper and um-hum the turn on the stereo and i'm just i'm i'm set for about an hour an hour is that all well maybe a little more at least an hour at least an hour yeah well i know my dad gets both i mean he gets the two Dallas papers here and he he sits down for at least about three so me i don't know i don't i don't sit specifically sit down on Sundays to read the Sunday papers sometimes i don't get to it till like Wednesday yeah yeah well that's the good thing about the Sunday paper though they have so many articles that aren't necessarily uh you know you don't feel like they're but eventually old if you don't get to them that on that one day exactly exactly well i uh i don't know i had bought books for years and years and uh the last time i moved when i was transferred to Houston i uh filled up one big closet with books because where i live now doesn't have a bookshelf doesn't have doesn't have the book shelves that i had in Dallas where i moved from um-hum and uh i don't know see i've i've just i've got such so many books and moving them was such a pain that i've really stopped buying so many and i started going to the library again which uh i hadn't done in fifteen years you know and it was kind of like an awakening i thought you know gosh this is free it's amazing so but i've enjoyed it and i um-hum yeah it's it's really a much better idea it's a bit inconvenient for me but i've i've always told myself i'd do that because i don't know i get the books and then after i read them if i really like them i'll keep them but if if not you know it's it's wasted space for me so i end up giving them away yeah yeah but um i've got i'm kind of sort of surrounded i've got three different libraries that are within oh i don't know it's uh i guess the furthest one away is maybe two miles one of them's only about a half mile away the other one's about a mile and a half well that's good and it and one in particular stays open until uh nine o'clock hm Monday through Friday so it's you know it's great and that makes it it it you know if they were just regular hours then it would be difficult because i'm usually work pretty late at the office but um um-hum anyway that uh i still like to go to the bookstores and browse around but uh well i'll i'll read the reviews uh-huh and if they end  for NIST the National Institute of Standards and Technology oh okay so it's right up your alley then i suppose so let me push the button all right okay um i guess i'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system but uh i sense that it's not gonna happen anytime soon yeah i don't think it's gonna happen either but i wish it were because i'm a i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering i'm at grad school now in acoustics and all we do is metric stuff um-hum you're now in what acoustics acoustics ah yeah so everything's metric and then you go to read some old book or something and it's all confusing so i don't understand as much so i think we should get one adopted permanently well i guess that is the policy but it's been the policy for a long time and nothing ever happens uh i suppose things some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening having a new generation come up that's more used to it yeah a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff just because they have to they have to for international trade yeah but i guess guess it's it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be uh because because because of of uh of computers coming into everything um-hum yeah i don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal i think people need to understand more like what a meter is instead of how many feet in a meter or something just get used to using all the terms because someone says a kilogram no one knows what that is everyone wants a wants a conversion of that before put a recognizing it as a as as as as a concept to hold in mind yeah um i i i don't see that it it it can change it very quickly i mean we're not the kind of society that that uh that something can be posed upon uh by government will yeah no one seems to be adopting it the metric system no one's very uh no one wants it at all seems like uh the the the the public is just very conservative that way in in refusing to change measurement systems uh money dollar coins anything like that yeah and and it and it it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in in using the old system yeah i don't know it's pretty tough when you get everything confused though i think two systems is worse than one though because i know we do a lot of problems and things and they're half English and half metric and you you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems i think they should just get one even if it's i prefer metric but even if it's just English they should at least have one well i mean unfortunately i think people like you are relatively rare rare who are coming up against this problem everyday yeah yeah i think so because your your average guy driving down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination uh i mean there there are things you could do uh we have signs up on the NIST campus here speed limit twenty five miles per hour forty kilometers per hour yeah uh but that hasn't been adopted very widely yeah they have some of those in Ohio there's this one sign's kind of funny it says uh metric signs next hundred miles but uh i mean and no one will will go a step further to remove the English signs yeah that'd force everybody to use it or to quit selling tape measures in inches uh you know or i mean you have highway signs saying speed limit um eighty eighty five whatever would be the appropriate number yeah i guess a hundred's sixty two hundred car is going sixty two yeah so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess car is going fifty five uh you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now yeah you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety do do do you know where you are do the schools emphasize the metric system yeah in the engineering they all do pretty much no i i i meant i meant down like in the elementary schools oh in the elementary schools i don't know i wouldn't think so i remember a ways back we did like conversions but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system i mean i think yeah i mean i think my children learned the metric system but it doesn't get get emphasized over the other yeah they learn how many centimeters are in an inch and that's about it  okay how did you find out about this well uh my brother-in-law sent me the thing from Texas oh right uh-huh and we're supposed to talk on voting is that right yes uh-huh uh why we think there's such a shortage uh low turn out okay um do you want to start okay well i think there's a uh a multiple multiple reasons i think first of all a lot of people are fed up and they think they don't really their vote doesn't count um-hum and second of all a lot of people just aren't educated to you know that they should do that they should participate they maybe they don't realize the importance of it or something right we had uh city councilman here that won by like a handful of votes you know ten votes or something oh uh-huh so that would have made a big difference if people had turned out for his opponent boy i'll say and i think another reason sometimes it's inconvenient uh-huh the hours especially in a presidential election i don't know why it couldn't go on for several days or why we couldn't even phone in our vote you know you can you can uh uh-huh now the colleges you can register over the phone i don't see why we couldn't vote over the phone you know on the computers and all oh that's an idea yeah well no we don't not oh you don't do that up there yeah we have the voting but uh i never heard of i mean you don't register for college there they doing that all over the phone now down here at the big at the big schools now what city are you in oh wow oh it's Mantua it's just a small small community we probably only have like oh seventy well maybe seven hundred people not very many really oh my my that's interesting right so when we vote it's like you say there's it's a handful of of votes makes a difference in fact this last November they had a vote and i think there was only like oh five to ten votes within the three different you know the three different people that were running for for the office of right just a difference of five or ten really hm yes yes in each of them and so like you say it makes a difference but that's that's a good idea about having it the voting over the phone maybe someday it will right yeah we could use our Social Security number or something there ought to be some way that they could safe guard it but it will a come uh-huh yeah uh especially presidential because you know sometimes you do have to stand in line for a long time right right and you know i wonder i don't know what the satistics are but i wonder what age um the least has the least good turn out for the voting oh that's a an interesting point i have no uh no idea i wonder i wonder if it's the younger people or the older people or just in the middle-aged or or who it is that doesn't turn out my guess would be the younger um-hum that's true i know a lot of them that don't vote uh because my i have a twenty year old and i know a lot of her friends don't vote um-hum oh and uh i go to school right now and i i've heard kids say they don't vote oh oh just because they don't care i guess well they don't really read the newspaper much you know i you know at that age i can remember being in college the first the first time and i was a journalism major and i hardly ever read the paper i think i mean it's appalling when i look back but oh uh-huh uh-huh you know i think that may be part of it too they're not really informed right and i don't know how big of a problem this is but i wonder if i've heard some people say on occasion that that the the candidates they don't care for any of them so they don't want to you know they don't want to give their vate vote for one or of other just because they yeah that's true that's very true i've heard people on talk shows say that they feel that that's a statement when they don't vote at all uh-huh right right that that's some that's saying hey you know we want somebody right better for the candidate i don't know i think that's kind of a cop out i really do i think you ought to you know make your opinion one way or the other there i mean if you even if you don't agree with cop out yeah i think so too i know even if you're voting against somebody more than for someone which i usually am nowadays in the national elections it seems right right we have uh i don't know when when i voted for somebody with great enthusiasm it was a long time ago oh and so this last election here in in our community they had um they counted them by hand you know the ballots by hand and i know that on the bigger ones they have little it's a punch card system are you familiar with that um-hum no you you punch it something out right you you have with your pencil you just punch you know they have a little tray that holds the ballots um-hum oh no i've never seen one like that and and apparently it makes the the counting a lot easier for the oh for those that are counting it but um with just the small ones they just go ahead and count it by hand and i really liked the the punch card one because we got the results so much sooner when it was over oh right well we have uh where you fill it in with the lead pencil and and the machine counts it it's really fast too uh-huh oh oh yeah that would be they probably can turn those results in it well well right like the Scantron you know they call it that goes through the machine i half the tests i take in school now are that way uh-huh oh it's so easy i just stick them in this machine and get the number out you know oh wow that's fascinating right right oh so have you ever run for any kind of  okay do you have anybody uh in your family that you ever had to put in a nursing home or my grandmother uh is the only person so far and um i basically think for her you know it was it was the best thing she was pretty out of it by the time she went into the nursing home okay was that here in Texas no it was in Arizona i'm from Phoenix and so it was in uh it was in Phoenix Arizona and uh that was hard but i it wasn't too hard a decision because there was sort of no other option by the time we put her in the nursing home uh-huh right right did did you have to put her in yourself or no i didn't my mother did uh she lived with well my aunt and my mother she lived with my aunt for a long time and then it got to where she was not manageable anymore she was uh-huh she didn't have Alzheimer's but um she was pretty much out of it and you know so they finally had to do that how about you understand understand that well my uh aunt that i kind of grew up with uh was in a nursing home she did have Alzheimer's and we had to put her in the nursing home because of that but uh this was up in uh Milwaukee Wisconsin and uh um-hum it was a situation that's probably as good as you're gonna get uh it's associated with uh our church and uh um-hum what they do my mother is in is a terrace which it's called Luther Manor Terrace and uh these are condominiums you buy into right when you know whenever you know you're sixty or whatever you know whenever you want to buy into this thing and these are very nice condominium things and uh the idea is once you are in this program you are taken care of the rest of your life and they um-hum they have a nursing home if you can't maintain your own apartment or your condominium uh you automatically go into that and from there they also have a health care area if you can't you know if you need more intensive care um-hum and uh even the best there is isn't a nice situation with uh like you say when you get to a point where uh well she was ninety four and she was uh in the nursing home and the health care facility for i would guess about a year's time but uh it's a hard decision to make i tell you what it's uh well it is now was your aunt uh she was she no longer had her mental faculties is that's that was really the price and that it gets very hard and on anybody uh i'd go up there and visit and and she'd recognize me but as soon as i was out down the hall she didn't even know i was there right um-hum um-hum and uh it's it's sad you know it well it is sad i think i don't think for me it would be as hard a decision if their minds were gone i think it's a harder decision if they're still if if their minds are still good but they're completely their bodies are gone you know i think that would be really hard to put someone in a nursing home in that situation um yeah you know i think there's some times when you there's just nothing else that can be done but i my uh my father's dead and and so i just have my mother and she's in real good health but i would hate to have to make that decision for her um well it's it's but what's really hard is the differences of care you know if you aren't fortunate enough to have a situation like with my mother you know i hope that that won't happen right right now she's got terrible arthritis in her knees and it's probably not real long where she won't be able to you know get along on her own and she probably um-hum um-hum you know hopefully it will be a number of years but she's seventy nine years old right now and now she understands that someday you know if she can't handle her apartment that uh you know she'll have to go in the nursing home um-hum but if you have situations where you don't have that kind you know it's you're confronted with it and if you look at all the different nursing homes uh that are out there it it is kind of frightening some of these places uh it's like put them in a cubbyhole and you know they don't they're they're more caretakers kind of it's almost like putting a dog in a kennel you know some of these places and they stink and they're it it's a tough decision and you know if people don't have the resources for uh right right it's i i don't know about in Arizona but around here i understand it's it's anywhere from about twenty three hundred to three thousand dollars a month in a a nursing home i'm i'm sure that's probably true i i don't know anymore now my grandmother's was the same idea as what you're telling me she we when we put my grandmother in um she was in a room by her you know she had a roommate and but her her care wasn't completely hospital yet but uh and then she went into the hospital part so it was one of those progressive care right uh kinds of situations and it was also affiliated with our church so it was a really nice facility but it would be terrible if you had no funds and and had to put someone in a nursing home and not know what kind of care they were really getting yeah and of course it's hard to know that unless you're there all the time um well and that's the other thing that helps is that you have a relative a close relative that'll look in on them um-hum even the best ones if you don't look in on them they have a tendency to just sedate people so they don't have to bothered you know and right  well what do you uh how do you feel about your uh job benefits well i'm a contract person and uh so i don't have a lot of benefits and uh uh i do think they're very important my husband has medical insurance and he has a life insurance policy his company does not really have a retirement plan and i think that's something that's very important um-hum and uh i believe medical insurance and retirement are probably the two strongest yeah well i um i worked for a two most important a large oil company for ten years and then resigned in eighty four and went into business for myself uh-huh uh and what i discovered at one after i had resigned it was kind of amazing i had never really thought about that corporate umbrella yes right while while it was there and after i resigned and i walked out from under it i really felt exposed and it was something that i had been completely you know you grow accustomed to having that behind you or or or over you uh-huh yeah you sort of take it for granted absolutely and it was i'll i'll tell you i was absolutely amazed at how at at the difference and then plus whenever i had to start paying for my own health insurance oh i know isn't that a shock and and life insurance believe me it was it was a rude awakening so anyway i was in business for myself for six years and then i have gone back to work uh since uh uh nineteen ninety i'm back in Houston with another oil company so i'm back under that corporate umbrella and i will tell you i am glad to have the coverage again well we uh kind of discovered it when uh the company my husband was with uh was in real estate and he had some nice benefits with it and all of a sudden when the market dropped out up here of course then you know everything kind of went downhill right and then he went with a steel company and they they folded but he was still under the uh COBRA plan on the medical insurance uh-huh and then all of a sudden the people that had taken it over went bankrupt well that ended COBRA plan plan and everything and uh yeah then we discovered and our medical insurance for three months was running us uh i think it was nineteen hundred dollars holy-moly you know our age and uh i had some arthritis and stuff and man they socked it to us uh-huh uh-huh yeah and you know course now fortunately we we're back we have some medical insurance well well i feel like i'm i'm the luckiest person in the world on in several ways number one i had the opportunity to get out whenever i left um uh Houston in uh eighty four and resigned i had the opportunity to get out and do all those things that i thought would be so glamorous and exciting wording working for myself yeah and they were and they were for a while and then i found out that it was just as much work to do that as it is going into an office you know getting on a plane and flying around and all that kind of stuff um-hum um-hum um-hum and what did you do consulting work well no actually i was uh my brother and i had a architectural design firm we did uh retail tenant finish out all over the US and it was oh uh-huh um-hum you know very successful and a lot of fun and more work than i've ever done in my life and at the same time i got all of that out of my system and it is so it's so wonderful now and i'm so appreciative too of and and i know now i think so much better than some of my coworkers what it means to and have somebody that's providing um-hum some of this stuff for you and uh you know i'm real lucky my company has good uh health benefits and dental benefits um-hum and also uh retirement plan on a contributory thrift plan that i'm um-hum i was just thinking about that today i need to up my contribution to that if i can force myself to save a little bit more um-hum well i know that my husband the company he's with now has excellent uh hospitalization and prescription card and dental insurance but they have no retirement uh-huh yeah benefits and you know we definitely you know miss this i grew up in a family that had their own business you cannot pay me enough money to go into business for myself and my husband has watched my family and i don't believe you could pay him enough yeah well i tell you until you've done it you don't know what it's like you you it's on your mind twenty four hours a day seven days a week and i'm i literally drove myself nearly insane i was at the office on Saturdays and Sundays i'd get up at um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum you're always i'd get up at i'd be sitting around at at nine nine o'clock at night and get up and go to the office and work until one o'clock um-hum you you know and well and you think you know okay you know are the employees going to get paid this week you know are we going to meet our and i precisely precisely and then the employees get paid and you don't that's right that's right i can remember my dad saying somebody saying they wished you know beef wasn't so high you know they could only afford chicken and my dad said if someone doesn't buy some beef i'm not gonna be able to afford the chicken yeah yeah you know and uh well i'll tell you i'll tell you the odds are definitely stacked against the small business person they they really are they really are cold um uh the problem that we ran into is that you know we we got beyond just being a real time  okay okay um well actually i don't really cook um i'm i'm still a student in college and um you don't okay i'm fortunate to have my mom cook dinners for me so i'm not not very experienced because um okay i'm i'm a single parent so i i guess i have to do a lot of cooking for my son and i oh yeah hm well i have cooked like small dinners like just hamburgers and things like that and canned foods that you just heat up nothing great though so yeah okay well i was born in in Louisiana my dad was Portuguese and my mother was Italian so i can i'm familiar with you know some Cajun food Italian Portuguese food oh Cajun food's really good i've had that before in uh Mississippi yeah oh New Orleans that's it yeah i've i've had all kinds of different foods i travel a lot but never cooked it myself so yeah you all have some pretty good cheese up there don't you pardon me say y'all have a lot of good cheeses up there though cheeses oh yeah yeah that's right yeah yeah i kind of miss that up Dallas uh i said there Portuguese and Italian blood in me and i kind of miss the cheeses because in in Dallas only get a bunch of domestic stuff you know oh yeah oh i love Italian food though it's probably my favorite kind of food yeah yeah is Italian food i don't think i've ever had Portuguese food well it's mostly they eat a lot of stews and soups and stuff what is that it's a lot of the stew and soup they they boil you know they boil or broil a lot of their food oh oh okay and it it's kind of like Spanish except it's not quite as spicy as the Spanish food oh yeah hm yeah yeah i like Mexican food yeah yeah the Mexicans they though Mexicans use a lot of hot peppers where the Portuguese use a lot of more garlic and stuff in the hot in the spicy food a real lot oh really oh so what do you like to make for you and your son yeah uh i like to cook spaghetti the kind that you cook the sauce for about three hours oh really so it's real thick and all you know uh my parents make their own sauce yeah it's really good yeah yeah i don't i don't think i can go the the jar stuff after after being spoiled by the real stuff hm and my son cooks a little bit he's sixteen he usually has supper cooked when i come home during the day so oh that's great that's really good i wished i would've cooked more when i was in high school yeah yeah we're we're both in Boy Scouts we learned to you know cook out over open fire in the woods and all oh that's great that's good to know sure it comes in handy yeah yeah and you know like to cook Cajun food when i when i can get the seafood it's kind of expensive in Dallas oh yeah i bet yeah but sometimes we had see we went into one of the grocery stores the other day and they had uh Cajun blackened shark oh wow and i tasted it and it taste pretty good and the shark was on sale so i bought some and the first time i'd eaten shark and cooked in it turned out real good oh that's good hm i've never had shark and i can't see it any it's first time for me and i didn't know i didn't know whether i'd ever eat it but i sampled it and it was it was all right uh yeah well that's good i like seafood but i hardly ever have it i haven't eaten it in a long time yeah well you you live on campus or um i used to i used to live in the dorm for two years but then i came back home i went to um University of Madison Madison so when you eat eat in the dorms you know there's a big cafeteria they have the food already prepared for you um-hum right so i didn't i didn't get a chance to cook much and now that i'm home my mom's home so she cooks so but i i do i make some things you know once in a while you know get hungry enough you're gonna cook for yourself but i'm still i'd like to learn you know i it's i like to bake i make cakes and cookies and things right oh you do yeah i can do that but okay i'm not very good at baking i'm you know good at cooking the main dishes oh oh yeah oh well i i'd like to learn how so it's one of my goals i'm sure i will once i move out on my own yeah yeah when i was living with my mother she she tried to teach me how to cook and i wasn't interested then see i'm not neither yeah and then once i moved out i miss her good food and i don't know how to cook it so i'm constantly looking up recipes or trying to cook what what i remember eating when i was small and wished i'd you know i'd learned from her yep yeah i should start doing that it it takes a lot of time though doesn't it yeah it it does course my mother never followed recipes you know she just cooked to taste i guess most good cooks do that anyway oh yeah they just add a little bit of that and a little bit of this and it comes out  so what did you have done to your car last well just fact just recently we're waiting to get it fixed right now it's uh my wife one day when it was kind of a windy day she opened the door and it kind of blew it all the way back kind of bent it back up against the front bumper there and so we're trying it it uh broke the uh the hinge that holds the door on onto the car oh and so it has to be rewelded and everything so uh we're waiting to get that repaired you know repaired and they have to weld it and touch up some of the paint and everything uh-huh and uh as for maintenance and stuff that i do i i i kind of don't don't do any my on on my own i other than waxing the car and kleeping it clean but usually i go to like Jiffy Lube and have them do the uh the oil change and the lubrication and such yeah that's really dirty work isn't it yeah how about you oh i'm a single woman so i have most of mine done and i my car died this year and i went down and priced the new cars and there was no way i could afford a new car uh-huh oh did it right so i just i went and had mine rebuilt i had a rebuilt engine put in it and the week after that the transmission went out so i had to put a transmission transmission in it uh-huh but it's running pretty good now after i had all that done gosh what kind is it it's a Lincoln um ours is a uh Voyager Plymouth Voyager yeah so and i really like that but that's about it i mean i don't do i used to i used to have a uh when i was single and i had a a uh Mustang a fast you know an old Mustang sixty five i used to do everything a lot of things you know i'll do all the oil changes and the tune-ups and yeah uh-huh and uh you know making it fast and putting carburetors and everything like that on it and uh i used to do all that but since since then really no since i got married actually and just find it easier to go to one of these uh you know fast places like Jiffy Lube or someplace like that is it that you don't have the time to work on it like you'd like to or you're just tired of it after doing it for so many years yeah that's that's pretty much no it's actually it's more like i don't have the time you know because we also have two kids too and so then i you know i just um-hum trying to find time for them and then try to do the car too i just you know and the house and the yard and you know everything else so uh-huh so usually i just uh try to make it as convenient as possible and go to one of those kind of places um-hum but well being a single person i can't afford much so i take mine to KMart and get the oil changed on it and i get yeah and i can get by pretty cheap on that and then i have a yeah friend that puts my plugs in it when i need new spark plugs and so he does that for me and that's that helps me a lot uh-huh oh good good deal so well i guess that's about it huh yeah i need new i'm putting new tires on it now so yeah oh are you oh yeah we did that too in fact that was that was the one right before this is uh we had to get some new tires in the back evidently one of the uh the right rear tire had one of the weights fall off it or something um and so consequently got a some kind of bubble in what they call out of round or something um-hum um-hum and so you can hear it when you sit in the back you know the thump thump thump thump thump thump and so we had to get a new one um-hum so that was a recent one too yeah and tires aren't cheap well car car that's a car is never ending yeah yeah right you it's always something that's true that's right yeah and uh i tell my friend uh when my when i have car troubles he says well you just you have to remember it's just a machine and it's not going to last forever that's right i say well i want it to yeah i want it to last forever i put i put uh two thousand dollars in it and i want it to last yeah you're right at least a little while least another year yeah yep well that's about all i have for stories on the car yeah me too well what well how old are your kids uh one's four and the other one's one oh well they're just little bitty kids yeah so they take up a lot of time really they do when they're little like that uh sure do and are they a boy and a girl or yeah uh-huh oh well you that's you're lucky you got one of each yeah i know we lucked out how's the weather down there at Virginia Beach very nice we've had a quite a warm last few days in fact it's been in the in the well sixty sixty seven to seventy so we've been really really good with the weather well it was in the seventies here today and that's that's really i think that's unusual for Dallas because i think by now it's snowing and we're having ice well last year i've only lived here for two years but last year at this time there was so is it yeah we were having snow and ice storms and i i just i can't it's it's uh sprinkling now i can't believe it's so warm out um-hum gosh i mean it's i i know it's in the seventies but it's very humid because it's sprinkling gosh oh really and today i wanted to ride the bicycle so bad and so that's what i did i went down to the lake and rode the bicycle down at the lake it was cloudy and and um-hum hm the rain  this is the first i have used this have you talked to anyone before only one time before okay uh i understand that we're supposed to talk about pets so do you have any pets that's right i sure do i was just feeding them all i have a a large aquarium oh what do you have and that sounds fishy excuse me that sounds fishy yeah it is i don't guess you make any waves though do you no i've got i've got a lot of fish in my aquarium and i've also got a dog who is sitting out there in the rain wishing i'd let him in but i yeah it's raining here rain where what part of town are you in uh real far north just north of Addison yeah oh really well i'm out in Garland so it's not raining uh well it may be raining i haven't been outside oh yeah it's raining out here and i just steam cleaned my carpet today and i really don't wanna let the dog in oh bless his heart what kind is it he's a a mutt he's part Schipperkes and part Chow uh-huh and he's he's real cute he's a he can turn me into a real sucker sometimes but can he get in out of the rain uh oh yeah he has a house but oh he just wants to give you the guilt trip well he usually spends all his time with us the whole time i see oh well that's good that's good so how about yourself do you have any well i used to have a poodle and he died and so my neighbor's cat has adopted me so it comes in and to see me and i have it a bed made on the little patio outside and um-hum oh uh-huh uh-huh uh i think it's adopted me so i think it's my cat now because i even took it and had its shots but because it's so friendly oh you're kidding uh i was afraid she hadn't well i'll ask her she had not had it's shots so i was concerned so i took it and had the shots oh yeah that's not good no it's a beautiful gray cat it's real sweet but anyway i'm i have to travel a lot right now in about um another year i'll probably get another dog because i'll be through traveling uh-huh huh uh-huh so you're a dog person huh well i think so i don't know how to handle cats really i i used to have a cat and he actually he died this summer but uh i had him for thirteen years and when we got this dog i didn't know what to do it just i never had a dog before in my whole life uh-huh uh-huh yeah and it was it's really different to have a different type of animal well i i just don't know much about cats and i um i don't know why i don't they see to themselves i think more than dogs do so that yes they do they're very self sufficient and they don't demand nearly as much attention or care that's right they say you you um have a dog but you what is the saying that you never really own a cat that you may own a dog but you the cats just kind of tolerate tolerates you yes that's right that's right well do you um um have your are you going to breed your dogs no huh-uh he's been neutered oh its just just for fun huh oh yeah he's just a pet and he he actually has turned out to be a great watchdog too so uh-huh have you been to North Park to see the kennel they have over there this year that you can adopt a dog you know for the holidays no uh no i haven't well i certainly don't need another one that's real cute well don't go over there then because it really hurt touches you when you see those that are up for adoption i know well you know i went before we got this dog we were looking around and we went to um some humane societies and that sort of thing and they would not allow us to adopt a dog uh-huh uh-huh how come because we both work and they required someone to be home all the time and quite honestly i think probably some dogs got put to sleep that could've had a good home i mean oh well i didn't realize that because i most people do work now and uh that's surprising yeah that's right yeah and i was too and and also there you know they come out and inspect your property and make sure you have a fence it has to be like an eight foot fence and our fence only happens to be six feet i mean i'm not but your little dog can't go over an eight foot fence no no i just so did you have to end up buying him yeah we ended we ended up we got him it was sort of a flea market but they had a pet store had a little shop setup uh-huh and yeah we ended up buying a dog which isn't you know really what i wanted to do but i couldn't pass the requirements yeah isn't that i didn't realize that well did you go to and yeah and i'll tell you my dog is spoiled well somebody told me that the Richardson kennel was good or the Richardson hm what do you call it where they pound i guess is real good about letting you have them there so i don't know uh-huh yeah i guess we should've tried the pound but the humane society uh wasn't interested in giving us a pet so huh well that's terrible yeah i thought it was too but i don't know how long we're supposed to talk do you um it's usually like five minutes not too long okay so i well does it does the recording come on or something no you just sort of decide when you're done talking and that's it did you okay well do you work in Dallas yeah i work at TI yeah oh TI i see oh so you're part of the program then well i just found out about it through a different department um i don't know anyone actually well i i might uh-huh  well i guess i don't have as much time for hobbies as i used to what is your hobby isn't that the truth uh i got two young boys uh four and two so i spend a lot of time with them but uh whenever the weather's nice and uh we can get out i like to work in the garden a little bit uh get that mud up in your fingernails yeah yeah i know how it goes yeah yeah you know that's pretty relaxing to me like this oh hey i tell you what getting outdoors is wonderful i do too my wife always gets mad at me for doing it so much because she says you know i always come in so hot and sweaty and tired i said yeah but i love it but for my you know my hobby believe it or not is really a collection i i collect Mickey Mouse really and i it is a full time hobby of going out there and finding things to to add to the collection i got well over two thousand Mickey Mouse items so that's that's my hobby wow that's great uh at one time and this is about fifteen years ago i actually uh got some uh what do you call it uh um-hum uh plywood board and i made some Christmas cut out figures that i put in the yard and i mean they um-hum everyone always talks about you know where'd i buy them and i keep telling them but i didn't buy them i i made them you know and they stood there now for some fifteen years so uh and that in itself was a lot of fun you know but i've never worked with a jig saw before but it sure did work you know wow that's pretty neat yeah and i guess the other hobby that i did at one time i don't do anymore is good old needlepointing and uh that was my wife's hobby and hm i see so i picked it up and i did some stuff and i entered it into the state fair and i won a couple ribbons and said well okay but for some reason it just didn't really catch my thing but my hobby of collecting Mickey Mouse yeah i think i've got the disease now now that you have more and more time on your hands right true true but i don't know you know it's you you're right though uh with the kids and i now have a six year old i don't have as much time for the hobbies as i used to what yeah yeah i know what you mean they take up all my time now i'm kind of looking forward to the time when uh they're a little bit older and they can get out and you know get a little more active in sports and well at this point my kid is six years old the we just finished our first season of flag football and daddy had a ball now i don't know if he had a good time but i had a great time and ah so i look you know more forward to that i guess maybe that stage of my life i i don't have enough time to do hobbies but i do have enough time to to play with the kids and that's what i wanna do yeah me too i'm i'm really i can't wait for that time i really can't wait uh i took them out to a a a little T-ball and that that that worked out real nice it he he enjoyed it uh i'm not sure that he understood what was going on but you know yeah but at six years old i i think they're still a little bit young yeah see my oldest is four but the but flag football he picked up that real quick he loved it really that that's great yeah and daddy loved it too i mean that's pretty good yeah mine's um uh just now has started getting into well you know like all the other little little young kids he was up on the Turtles and stuff but now he's trying to get into Robin Hood ah and so we're gonna get him some one of those Nerf Robin Hood bow and arrow things well i'm going to be doing for this Christmas uh i'm buying him a uh swing set which includes a fort and everything else uh-huh oh and they say it only takes thirteen hours to build i'm thinking uh-huh so i have a feeling i might find myself with a full time hobby i've got a uh a fence builder who's gonna come over there to help me so oh that's good hopefully between the two of us we can figure out how to put that sucker together yeah yeah it always always helps to get somebody to help you out got oh yes the the swing set that we have a little Jim Dandy uh made out of metal is okay but he's much too big for that and his imagination's much bigger so we we've got the monkey bars and the fort and you know it goes on and on and on hm uh-huh yeah wow yeah yeah whenever uh um every now and then i'll take mine to the park and they like to play on all of that stuff that's at the park and and it's like you said it's got the fort and you know it's the whole works oh yes um-hum made out of wood and and now who knows maybe the kids in the neighborhood will wanna come to his house to play you know so he always goes over their houses huh uh right now we always do because he says there's nothing to play with at our house so well okay so i'd like to have my turn to be able to invite the kids because i i don't know about you but i love having the kids around it's fun yeah uh there aren't too many right now actually mine are the oldest on our block uh the other ones are at least a year to two years younger so ours is a a block of pretty young kids right now ah uh i think in my neighborhood there's about two or three at the same age but most of them are about two or three years older so mine my a little bit younger so but oh well he'll he'll he'll get there oh i see i see yeah i wanna know this side of it and and they do they do tend to congregate around our house and and you know i never really thought about that much either all the little ones come over and they kind of hang around our front yard but uh so so i guess the bottom line conclusion is take  you feel about uh drug testing in the work place well actually i'm all for it even though um for instance like in the area that i work for you know there's no danger you know of someone getting hurt because of you know being on drugs or something but uh uh i think because of ethics involved and uh things i'm just i'm in favor of it i i realize that that's putting a lot of government control in effect or or control over people but uh i think we need something in place to uh to solve the problems i certainly uh feel that it ought to be done in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs oh definitely well it's just like uh i can't remember now where it was what two three months ago there was that there was that bad train wreck and uh one of the um engineers running the train was on drugs you know and people were killed in it and and yeah when it comes to safety and people being killed i definitely think it should be a requirement you know um-hum yeah um-hum you're uh you know to heck with their rights you know they're interfering with people's rights to live yeah you know if they're in that type of position and have that much control over people one of the issues that came up for me personally was that uh we see i've gotten involved in uh foster care uh-huh and i've seen a lot of uh kids come into foster care as a result of their parents being on drugs yes and uh there's probably a lot out there that could probably stand public assistance or being rescued uh which aren't identified and so uh um-hum testing at the work place in uh in in general i think is probably a good idea to to save some of the kids feeling like that if you know then you can look into a situation and in case there are children involved yes uh-huh yeah i can i can understand that i i think it is you know i think it's so sad these these crack babies that are now coming into you know grade school elementary school you know that are so um um-hum oh you know they're so messed up themselves and you know in talking to teachers i have several uh friends that are teachers they uh um you know they're hard to control they're hard to deal with and yeah i think that would be a good idea um-hum yeah being i'm a contract person with Texas Instruments and before i could even go to work here i had to be drug tested you know and they do a random drug testing of their employees um-hum uh but so far far um they don't require everyone to do it they just go through randomly and pick someone and you know and go do it and TI has an excellent um yeah assistance program if you're found you know found with drugs they actually give you i think um three tries um-hum you know to to quit it or get off of it or or whatever before you're you know dismissed i mean they work with you and they they have a program uh uh that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and also it's really an excellent program i know it seems like the older ones here are in favor of it the younger ones you know course are still they're either you know doing some marijuana or something or they're very idealistic you know and uh i don't know i think sometimes the older that you get i think the more ramifications you can see of so many things yeah well our company uh testing when you're hired is a requirement is it and i think they have a policy of uh random testing but uh i don't know whether they've ever done it or not i kind of wish they would um-hum um-hum um and we do have an employee assistance program that's uh good for uh drug abuse uh treatments and other psychological uh problems uh-huh um-hum stress in the work place marital problems whatever's bothering you yeah this this program you know encompasses everything but you know i thought you know it's not an instant dismissal if you are found to be taking drugs which i think you know is good and it's good on TI TI's part as i said i think they give you three chances you know to come to grips with it before you're dismissed what you know a lot of times i see problems here at work though uh i remember a few years back i had a uh schematic drawing that needed to be done and i was in a hurry to get it out um-hum well i sent these drawing the rough draft over to drafting and i usually do a pretty decent drawing myself uh-huh when the drawing came back uh it was was apparent that it had been done by two people because the line work  okay do do do you work outside the home or you a student i do i'm i'm a student and i work at Nu Skin you're a student oh okay so you have a wardrobe to choose so yeah do you wear more dressy type clothes or casual or um we're allowed to wear we just we just can't wear jeans um every Monday through Friday we just have to wear you know nice slacks or um just something that looks nice and then on Fridays and Saturdays we can wear jeans so uh-huh uh-huh oh oh like jean day oh does your does it change pretty much from does it change from season to season or is it pretty standard um it's pretty standard i mean just more sweaters and stuff of course in the winter but uh-huh well it seems like you know warmer warmer even in the winter you go from your warm car to your warm building so there really isn't that much of a of a difference or in the summer it's it's mostly air-conditioning course you do wear cooler things but i um don't work outside the home right now i have four little ones and so my right oh wow my clothing doesn't need to be probably as fancy as yours but um you know mostly during the day i wear the the casual type things and and i have the sweaters and the in the winter and fall and um-hum and cooler things in the summer but i for my husband he wears pretty standard all year round because it's so climatized his work situation but we just recently done something that we found really helpful with his wardrobe and that is um we send all of his shirts and his slacks to the dry cleaners and we hadn't been doing this previously i was you know washing them and ironing and taking care of them at home and we found that it makes them wear and look so much better to have just everything dry cleaned i don't know whether you oh really and you don't find that gets too expensive or well we uh figure it's pretty much worth the expense just because um really the the dry cleaner comes right to his place of work and picks the articles up and takes them and dry-cleans them and brings them back the next day and then they give the company a fifteen percent discount so it really wow it really is not that expensive and we figure you know what it saves on wear and tear and then and saving me having to do it and they look so much better when they're dry-cleaned um-hum than when i do so that it does it does and that's kind of a that makes it really nice uh just just a you know thing we've recently started that's that we found really helpful uh-huh does he have to wear suits and ties and no he doesn't he he wears if he has an meeting a meeting or an important thing he wears a suit and tie but most of the time it's just dress slacks and and you know white shirt usually and a tie uh huh so that now that's interesting do you wear when when on the days that Monday like Monday through Friday do you wear slacks mostly or dresses or um i i rarely wear dresses do you you're not a dress person yeah i mean it doesn't it doesn't have to be that dressy guys have to wear ties at work but shirts and ties at Nu Skin but uh-huh oh uh-huh even even during the week they do huh or i mean on weekends do they other than that oh no no no not on the weekend but um the guys seem to get to have to dress up a little more than the girls oh for some reason we can get away with more oh huh what about like shoe type things do you wear mostly dress shoes or do you wear tennis shoes or what um no we can't wear tennis shoes during the week either so oh well i guess you couldn't because you wouldn't have jeans on yeah we can't wear tennis shoes but i it's pretty casual i i found i mean it it would be what i would wear to school anyways most of the time so oh so can you wear right what you wear to school to work you don't have to change yeah yeah i well i work in the mornings from six thirty to ten thirty so well that's oh i get up pretty early and then school comes after that so i just don't bother to change for school unless i really want to be casual but uh-huh oh oh well that's interesting okay well can you yeah how long have you been doing this TI thing um let's see about two weeks is all really how did you find out about it my uh my brother he's in is he in Dallas he yes well he's in Plano that's just outside Dallas yeah oh really that's where i'm from oh are you yes Plano yeah yeah um what is is he in a ward down there or yeah um i wonder should we wait until she comes on and and disconnects us to talk about all this or sure okay let me just should we finish let me just ask you a couple more things about clothes and then i'll and then she should be on um okay oh what was i gonna do you do you like the suits do you wear suits or do you like more more feminine type dresses um i i like yeah i'm more into suits i think i'm more uh that style huh yeah more what's it called just um tailored yeah and oh what's the word i can't think of the word it's um yeah tailored just things that don't  hello hi yes hi i'm fine hello how are you did you uh did you get the topic i think they said hobbies didn't they yeah yes uh-huh where are you from calling from oh okay i'm in Dallas yeah oh really Plano are you that's about as far away as i've gotten so far i had a lady two blocks away last time oh i talked to a guy in Virginia Beach last night oh see that would be fun yeah yeah that was interesting okay let's talk about our hobbies you ready okay okay um i don't have too many hobbies right now i do do sew a lot uh-huh and um i used to sew more than what i do now it's it's takes a lot of patience and i'm running out of that the older i get yeah it does and i used to do a lot of stitchery and uh but that takes a long time too it's just it's very time consuming to do sewing and stitchery and things like that what do you do well i used to sew a lot when my girls were really little and i made a lot of their things but like yourself i find i run out of patience with it too and i like to do craft things uh-huh you know i was uh make those fabric covered photo albums and i teach a class oh those are nice those are really pretty uh-huh and i teach that for the Parks and Rec Department a couple times a year teach what how to do it um-hum and i do that and i do a lot of interior decorating and i can upholster the walls and things like that so that's about my hobby and i don't have time for a whole lot oh i see uh-huh that's right but um it used to be you did those things to relax but now i don't think there's time to relax so so there is not very much time for that but um that's right because the women work now most most of them do and what i did things like that when i wasn't working when uh my kids were little babies and i stayed home with them that's when i did it uh-huh i do uh-huh right yes see i did too right that's right but when you work full time then it's very hard yeah it is hard but it does save money to do things that way and um i found that i got pretty good at decorating so that kind of is real helpful but you do have to find the time uh-huh well you probably did it more when your girls were little you did it with them so not really i've just really started to do that i just redecorated my bedroom this past year and then i went on to my daughter's room and they turned out really nice i just bought sheets oh and i made the curtains and i upholstered the walls and in her room i even upholstered her furniture the drawers oh that's nice so it really turned out nice yeah so you can do a lot for a pretty little amount of money that way uh-huh that's true so my latest thing is those stiffy bow baskets those what the baskets with the stiffy bows have you seen those i don't know if i have or not um they're they just have uh like pieces of fabric and they put it in uh fabric stiffener and let it dry and then bend it and put it on baskets it's real attractive and i i haven't done one but i bought the things i need and uh my daughter's mom oh is that for a table center piece the basket uh just to sit around the house like for sewing and magazines and things whatever you want potpourri depends on the size you buy oh i see to put things in uh-huh uh-huh and uh friend of mine does them and they're just really pretty and she's supposed to show me exactly how to do it one day when i show her how to do an album so i don't know what day that will be but that's our next project probably after Christmas you know when my parents had their fiftieth wedding anniversary i was working in a little Cloth World shop uh-huh and some old ladies came in and they said they did that they said they covered uh photo albums like that uh-huh and i said well uh why don't you make one for me and put gold on it because my parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary is coming up and they said okay right they said how pretty it was the ones were that they made so they brought one in for me and uh i just i hated it i thought it was awful uh-oh and here i had told them to make it they were from out in the country you know and they'd made an extra trip to town hm you've got to be careful yeah to bring me my photo album and i i i didn't like it at all and i told them i said you know i just don't care for this i don't like the way this is put together and uh i don't like what you used and then and then i felt real bad and i said well i'll take it because i ordered it you know and i it was my fault because i didn't specify what i wanted on it or anything i just kind of left it up to them yeah and it it was they were old ladies  well um i don't know i'm have only been um selected for jury duty one time and it was sort of a a rude awakening to our judicial system um after having served on the jury and uh come to a decision uh and and really it was a case that was cut and dry the uh the defendant on uh the witness stand admitted he was guilty and then uh the first thing that was done was after um we we found him guilty his attorney jumped up and uh started going through the procedure you know routine for filing an appeal which you know i i i know that that's the right uh but the defendant but i mean it makes you wonder why go through it one more time when you know he admitted he was guilty of the crime so um i don't know that it was a little bit disgruntling to me it right i have never served on a jury i have been called like only twice in my life and and uh at the time i've been a legal assistant and nobody wanted me on their jury so i've been excused but uh i uh i don't know i look at the people who get excused and and it's supposed to be a jury of your peers and i'm not sure it always is uh right and it is a lot it is a huge burden to put on people who don't know the law uh you know that especially in criminal cases when you're deciding someone's life uh-huh i i'm not so sure that you know that that's something that is that you can really really have the knowledge to do as as just a lay person oh not i agree with that and certainly um i think that uh i know that uh i have heard of people being you know in on a on a criminal case and uh saying that you know and i think you've got this option that if you want if you are found guilty by the jury that you can choose even before the trial begins for the judge to sentence you uh and that i i think i think i'm correcting correct in that but uh well a lot of states the judge can set i mean they do set the penalty you know the the judgment at once it's rendered guilty you know the sentencing is done by the judge in in a lot of the cases um some cases it is up to the jury but uh-huh you you know you're told if you find them guilty then this is the choices that they have to make it's either life or death you know right right but uh i don't i don't know it just it it seems like in some of these cases i don't know that you could really have an impartial juror because of the media given right and i don't you know in today's age of television the coverage like it is there's no way that you can be shielded from it well i i understand what you're saying and at the same time i'm afraid that there are people out there that walk are walking around that have no more conception of what's going on day in and day out than if someone came down from Mars and and unfortunately those people who my in my book i would i would consider them to be terribly uninformed might be deemed the most eligible people to be put on the jury while like like you said earlier i don't necessarily would i don't think i'd consider them to be a jury of my peers uh-huh you know so i but that's well you know one of the reasons why i hope i never have to be in a position to have a jury listen to what a case of mine and i hope i never you know am in that situation well i know when i've been you know called to jury duty they had to stand up there or stay you know until they dismissed me and i look at the people and the reasons that they get dismissed um before they even you know the selection is is even started it is your profession you know nine tenths of them are your professional people right right who are out in the world you know the rest are retired or they're housewives or uh  okay Jerry i guess tonight's topic is about recycling and i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community here in Plano um-hum all right right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up by the by the collection agency or the the city along with your garbage can uh you can put out newspaper you can put out glass you can put out aluminum cans you can put put out certain types of plastic material and that's on a roll out effort right now not all the citizens and the people in Plano can go ahead and uh participate right now but uh that will be rolled out to everyone i hope in the next year or so and those that aren't participating they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum and i think uh overall that's an an excellent opportunity because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and uh growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they're becoming a big problem for only not only the people that are living today but for the future also yeah uh i was reading my community that's cute i live in a place called Dye Mound so how about your community Dye Mound or Dye Community uh-huh and it's not a city not incorporated my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least i can't even see their house and uh sounds like a place where i grew up yeah i mean uh i'm out in i'm out in the wilderness literally well i like it and uh well give you an idea it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete i mean to the asphalt we're out there uh-huh and uh we i do some interesting recycling things well good i'm building our house right now and i'm going to incorporate into my uh garage area a weight activated uh crusher oh okay so when i drive the car in the in the driveway in the afternoon it it'll just drive it up on a ramp that actually puts me on top of the the uh pressure side of a uh hydraulic cylinder um-hum and the weight of the car will crush what's ever in the disposer oh hopefully hopefully it's not my wife well let's hope not you can be uh get in trouble for that well i thought i'd you know i'd use it as a a escapement type thing i don't know if you're familiar with that operation but what you do is you just build up the pressure uh-huh and then you go over and release it and then it just it just drops you know well it's quite similar to a hydraulic jack isn't it very similar yeah okay okay well what what it'll be you just you drive up on the jack but you it won't go down yes until you release it until you pull the pin yeah all right i think that's anyway i i have another uh recycling method i use yes you know all that junk mail you get oh yes i sure do the glossy paper that says buy this and send off for that and you have won and all that well anytime they send me a return envelope uh-huh um-hum i put all that stuff back in the envelope plus the other stuff that i you know happen to gather up oh because uh well like i say we live away and when you throw trash away you throw it in my yard and i don't like that so i don't do that so i take it and i send and i mail it back to them yes no well great that's excellent i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff well uh if a lot of people did that then then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail that's a great idea i hadn't thought about that and we might be able to incorporate some of that one thing yeah well i think one of the the best ways to eliminate uh or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non-reusable items right for instance uh i saw a thing on uh Nova think was the other day this guy has designed um-hum recyclable materials i mean recyclable items whatever he makes it's all out of the same thing right oh see so if it's plastic it's all out of plastic if it's metal it's all out of metal it's he's a design he's a engineer designing stuff yes well that's a great idea that's a great idea and incorporating incorporating incorporating incorporating you know reusable materials into your uh you know your assembly line into your actual scheme of product product operations is is the only way to really do it on a on a broad scale make it financially uh attractive to recycle and somebody will find a way to make money at it yes uh-huh yes they will exactly well there is a guy in Dallas that's all he does hm he collects trash well that's a full time job you know yeah well he's he's out for cardboard yes well i've found out too that uh you know a couple years ago we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years and at one time we could get a pretty good return uh with the Boy Scouts we could take and collect the newspaper an and  oh now we can talk about that great team yeah i think we know where we're heading well uh well i just heard i guess uh big problem right now on the other side Duke's trying to sign Sierra you know but apparently he's gonna sign for twenty five at five is what they're saying you you think he's worth it who could be worth that huh well i mean i don't know i think i think i'm worth twenty five million if he is but uh uh as far as i mean if they're going to pay Nolan Ryan four and a half million i mean yeah he's definitely worth it just because i mean Ryan's only got a couple good years left in it where Sierra's got at least another ten or fifteen years but i mean yeah that i i think they'd be better off trading him off for two million and a half dollar a year pitchers they can win some twelve games each well uh the problem is you have Tom House who is going to he'll blow their arms out i mean that's true that's true and Sierra i mean those pitchers you got a uh they've got to resign them just to keep the credibility of this franchise i mean because if they don't resign them i mean that's pretty much going to be the last straw they've kept Valentine Valentine way too long i think you're right i i think that as long as they they keep that uh management team i don't think there is going to be a winner i agree with you and it's you know i don't think i mean he's even said he he you know that probably will not not sign for as much as Bonilla did but i mean because apparently he's he uh he's real into um Arabian horses and one of the minority owners is a big time uh Arabian horse uh dealer or whatever and he's i guess there has been some he'd want he wants to stay out here and get some land and develop that because i was listening to a show the other night apparently he he doesn't want to he doesn't really have the stomach to go into a large market and have to prove himself all over again but yeah he's got it made if he just stays there so he'll probably stay and well i'd stay for five million bucks a year oh i'll stay for a million but they could twist my arm you know if if somebody that's going to pay it i mean you might as well i you know can't blame him for taking it i mean that's well uh well i i i don't either i i think uh you know the the whole pro sports have gotten out of control and watch watch a game on TV they got so many ads to pay for the thing if i can fall asleep during a football game wake up and not have missed a missed a down for crying out oh exactly and that's the way baseball's going turn into it is they they have gone up to uh last year ninety seconds between innings instead of a minute and uh-huh they keep escalating the salaries as they are i think they're going to wind up with as much you know advertising as they do uh playing ball and uh it's going to eventually kill the golden goose i i think i i don't even think it's America's pastime anymore i think football took it over i mean i was a big baseball fan when i was younger but i still follow it and everything but it's just oh i i enjoy i enjoy them both i there's just i uh refereed football for forty yeah for forty yeah it's the only thing going in the summer but football is definitely a little bit more exciting right now but i mean you know well i think uh amateur you know high school and college is a lot more enjoyable to watch than uh you know football than than the pros oh yeah i agree they're just sitting around i last Cowboy game i went to they were sitting around uh between plays so long uh i don't see how they can break a sweat for heaven sakes you know just waiting on edge yeah that's one thing that's and uh it it's too bad so yeah the worst is when they they kick the ball off after uh when it's a commercial after they score a touchdown yep yeah then they got then they got another six more commercials then then they kick it off then the commercial after that they bring them you know that's that's the one commercial i think they need to eliminate yep but they won't they they want the money you know the yeah someone's got to pay for it but yeah they're they're greedy and they you know they all admit it's a business and that's what comes first and that's probably what the is is a major problem with the Rangers they make money and they don't uh as long as they make money and are respectable they don't make a you know they aren't going to pay the bucks out to be a winner and lose money and that's apparently what it takes what it what what it's taking right now well i think they're just hoping something happens to them like happened to Atlanta which is a fluke i thought anyway tell you what i got i got to keep talking to you but i think this is my car guy calling on this line so we're we're we're probably almost done but hang on just hello yeah yes okay uh you got another call good did you get uh well that's that's okay hang on a minute Andy okay just a second we'll finish this off here okay i've been waiting five days for my car so he can wait a couple seconds here that's uh but anyway i i think we've probably got a oh yeah situation that we aren't going to see a winner this year but as long as well i i just i mean i've been a fan since i guess the uh middle seventies and uh it's just been the same thing every year i don't expect anything and i mean with the lineup they have  well let's see what have you seen lately well uh City Slickers and Star Trek Five five yeah uh yeah you only only five yeah i thought i'd better see that one before i go and see six well nah didn't need to no i found that out i just saw the latest one how about yourself how is it it was fantastic oh i can't wait yeah it's the the lines in there were just perfect i mean it was classic Trek now does the old Star Trek guys meet the new guys no huh-uh no it's just the old guys still yeah it was just a rumor that that would happen this time however the rumor is is that it will happen next happen next time so you know that i read in People or somewhere no it was USA Today um-hum that they said they weren't gonna do anymore that was it um-hum yeah uh but except that the rumor is is that they still might but it may not include the entire crew and it will be a next generation meets this generation huh i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the the old guys was so i think it's a hundred years huh somewhere in that range considering that Spock was on an uh you know couple weeks ago and and that the the very first episode of Next Generation they had McCoy oh that's right is that right he was a doctor still and um-hum yeah well you know he it was like a rear admiral whatever you know and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow Vulcans age a lot better well yeah he didn't look too bad did he huh no huh-uh matter of fact he looks just as about as old and the uh Next Generation as he does in the latest Star Trek imagine that yes yeah that's amazing uh did they have some pretty good special effects oh excellent excellent special effects but i think the script was you know just incredible compared to the last one yeah Five was the script was bad bad bad no i don't why well you know why uh William Shatner wrote it oh is that right and even worse he directed it uh Leonard Leonard it its Nimoy he does a lot better oh yeah he in fact uh he didn't direct this one he produced this one but he directed the one before uh i think Star Trek Four something like that In Search of Spock or no Journey Home i think that yeah um-hum are you're a real life Trekkie well i think so i really like them i i wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie but um-hum uh-huh well i've gone to you know one for real live Trek Convention but oh really yeah i saw James Doohan you know the guy that plays uh Scotty huh did you get to talk to him no not in a crowd like that huh-uh it was like uh want an autograph wanna stand in line for about four hours it was a pretty crowded place it was crowded no yeah wow huh they have some good management principals in this New Generation oh yeah yeah i it's it's kind of funny i uh was reading in uh a book uh trying to think i can't quite remember the name of the book but it was it was saying don't do Star Trek management style and they were referring to you know Captain Kirk every time he left the Enterprise everything went to hell oh and and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship right and he kind of was a cowboy type too um-hum he made all the decisions but uh Jean Luke does more of a a committee type of management um-hum yeah um it's definitely a lot better a lot more realistic really what other movies have you seen uh saw The Addams Family last week oh how was that it was pretty good uh there were a few things different than the old series but on the on the whole it was pretty similar and a lot of fun lots of little funny spots huh oh yeah yeah did they have Thing and oh yes in fact Thing has a big much bigger role than he does in the series i mean you know there is lots of areas where Thing saves the day really and he runs around a lot how did i've always wondered how he gets around uh you know just finger hopping but he's in a box right no no no in fact it's funny he never did does come in out of a box i don't think and he's just kind of walking around didn't he used to not really he was always in the box before oh well that's yeah that's okay yeah that's what i was thinking yeah  they want us to talk about football football our favorite football teams and it doesn't sound like to you yours will be the Dallas Cowboys with your accent it well it is well actually it isn't actually i the New York Giants but i do like the Cowboys oh right oh okay where are you well i'm in in uh Plano in Texas yeah where are you Plano i'm in Dallas oh well well what are you doing down here you working uh well no well my husband was transferred down here oh is he is he with TI no huh-uh okay but anyway they want us to talk about football and uh right your favorite team is the New York Giants yes but you know they're not doing so good this year well that's true but that happens after the anytime you're the Super Bowl team it's it's hard to repeat because everybody's shooting for you yeah yeah that's true but i i don't know they have basically the same team they had last year i just i think the coaching stinks you don't think that maybe their desire is not there or maybe they're a year older well i don't know i just think uh they got rid of Bill Parcells well they didn't get rid of him he quit and i just don't like the guy that's replaced him he's very conservative in his play calling yeah you know i think he uh he could should he could have taken more chances this year you don't think Parcells saw the handwriting and thought he'd be better to go out as a winner well that's possible but now i hear uh he's been talking with the uh Tampa Bay uh i know it but see he can only go up from there because they're so bad exactly exactly you know if you go out on top and then go somewhere else it's bad well it's it's well i don't i don't know i think Phil Simms yeah uh do you think Phil Simms might have been treated badly since he got bumped aside for Hostetler well gee i don't know it's hard to say you know you Hostetler Hostetler brought them to the Super Bowl and uh i don't know yeah but do you do you think it's fair because Simms was hurt that he didn't get his job back and then if he didn't do the job put Hostetler in there well it's a it's possible you know i who's to say i mean uh i don't know Hostetler he'd he had his his right numbers were there i mean you know he he had pretty good numbers but um that's right it it just seemed to me that everybody was just a half a step off i don't know whether it was age or determination or coaching or what you know because it just somehow they were almost there all the time but yeah i don't know they're very disappointing their offense was very it didn't do anything i mean their their maybe they they i think the most they they scored in any game was like twenty four points or something uh-huh you know they really had a i don't know why because they had the same well you know they had the same offense as last year but they didn't score all that many points last year in each game but they um they have a terrific one of those things where everything just falls in place for you you know yeah i guess i guess yeah well how about the Cowboys they're doing you know great that's right but look what happened to them the last couple of years well yeah but now well you know they're really on the road back you know i mean that that game yesterday was terrific yeah that's true were you out there no no i i haven't been to a game in a long time oh well i've had season tickets since um nineteen sixty seven so i've seen a few games oh really oh that's great were you out there yesterday oh man yes uh-huh so it's uh do well do you think Lawrence Taylor is about had it i don't think so i mean i hope not anyway i mean he's so good you know yeah i know he's uh fun to watch yeah he's great to watch and yeah he's he's real good yeah well you think y'all will fire your coach uh i don't know uh you know i don't know i think maybe they'll give him another year yeah they probably will you know but um i was disappointed he was too conservative and he just didn't take enough chances uh-huh and um i you know i'd i'd prefer them to get somebody else i'd like to see them get Parcells back well well i think he probably had to had pressure long enough and he wants to go somewhere where he can you know i can see his point it was a good time for him to leave really yeah he left on top you know two Super Super Bowls in uh what four years that that's pretty damn good yeah yeah well what what else could you do yeah you know he couldn't really top it so uh and now i'm sure he's making more money doing uh you know sports reporting yeah well what do you think you all's draft choices needs are for next year or do you get into it that deep uh-huh what the Giants um you know i really don't i guess i guess they can um i really don't know defense and offense i suppose you know i've got they've got the running backs well they could use a uh i guess they could use some more good receivers you know and well didn't y'all lose your tight end also that uh yes and Navarro was terrific yeah they could use a a couple of really good tight ends they really they don't really have you know really you know super tight ends yeah what happened what happened to him did they trade him or did he go somewhere Navarro he was uh injured and i don't know then he came back and then they released him is that i couldn't remember what happened to him yeah yeah because uh he was good oh he was terrific he was like uh Novacek Novacek is  yes we're going there on our way well uh this is a good topic for me because i just got off a jury on Friday oh i'll bet it is a good topic then yeah have you ever been on a jury before i have been on a jury once and it was an experience of a lifetime uh-huh really what kind of a trial was it it was just a it was like a civil suit um and i really felt that by the end of it i had no respect whatsoever for our jury system uh-huh oh really what what did you think was wrong with it yep it well we all had to agree it well we didn't all have to agree because it was a civil suit uh-huh ten out of twelve had to agree and we had like twelve questions and the exact same ten people had to agree on all twelve questions uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and that's really hard i mean we deliberated for ten hours and that was a long time and people got with each other and i mean it just was not a good situation yeah wow yeah um-hum hm that's interesting well and you know by the end of it i didn't feel like anybody won i feel like we compromised compromised until we got to the point that nobody won really wow that's what about yours well i've been on two actually and the first one i was on was also a civil trial but it was real apparent to all of us what what the situation was so it was real simple hm um and we only deliberated as maybe three hours and we weren't really deliberating we were reading through the whole charge and and trying to understand what the judge had written but i mean beyond that we really didn't have much debate um but the one i just got off of was capital murder trial yeah oh wow and uh that uh um i don't know if it's fortunate or not i was an alternate so i sat through five days of the trial and it's sort of like seeing five days of a movie and missing the last ten minutes because i don't know what happened yet oh because you weren't allowed to go into deliberations were you and that's right that's right and they also they can't report it on TV or anything so i don't know you know until it's completely over i won't know what happened oh wow so it was it was really interesting and and i can see are are you real definite as to how you think you would have voted and everything i i was leaning one way or another but i really needed to look at some of the evidence to make sure um-hum but it it you know it was fairly clear and i talked to the judge afterwards and you know and knowing what i know know now which the other jurors didn't know i'd definitely convict the guy because he was he was found involved in two more of them and he was caught on the scene a the third one oh wow so it was it was fairly obvious you know that he had done it and eventually i'm sure one of the in one of the three trials they'll probably convict him if not the first but uh but is this one the first this is the first one they tried him on yes so it was it was wow where are you from um i'm in North Dallas where are you oh okay Plano oh okay well this happened in Plano you'll be thrilled to know what trial are you talking about excuse me what trial are you talking about um well the one i was involved was at uh Warehouse Beverage it's on uh i think it's Fifteenth and Avenue K and the one he was later involved in was the Texaco one um-hum um-hum uh-huh and i don't know what the third one was oh my well i'll have to watch the paper then when did they go into when did they go into deliberations but the Texaco one yeah that on Friday but that was just the the guilt and innocence phase and i don't know you know then there is the punishment phase after that oh now is the jury going to decide the punishment phase um well all they can decide they don't really tell say we want capital punishment or we want something or life imprisonment you know if they find him guilty those are the two options for capital murder but they had six six choices what he was guilty of uh um-hum um-hum but all they can do there is three questions that they have to evaluate one being could he be a future threat to people well he's already proven that but you know a couple questions like that and your answers are yes or no and if you get i think it is three yeses it's capital punishment um-hum or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but it's not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way wow and that's what it that's what it leads to and it leads you to the punishment yeah wow so it was really interesting and i wish i knew if they were still in deliberations but i don't um well it is it when did you say it was Friday so Friday they went into deliberations but i don't know if the press can report at the end of the the guilt and innocence phase or if they have to wait until the whole punishment thing is over because that will take another couple weeks Saturday Sunday Monday um i don't know wow so but it was it was really interesting so you enjoyed yours then well i it i learned a lot what i didn't enjoy was not being able to plan anything in my whole life because i mean as far as i knew this could take months some of them do right oh yeah some of them do and that was the thing you know with Christmas and everything and i couldn't make reservations to go home but uh you know now that it's over it was really interesting who is the judge um Nathan or Nathaniel White Nathaniel  see uh i i have forgotten a few calls but um doing i i they called last night i think somebody tried to call i had got food poisoning uh Saturday night and i was spent the early hours of the morning and most of the day Sunday in the emergency room and i had just gotten home last night oh oh bless your heart and the answering machine must have gotten it because it just gets the last little bit of the you know the computer talking well yeah well well i knew that you were sick for our last meeting did you have that on top of the flu yes i had i was sick anyway and then i had to work most of the week and it really ran me down so the weekend i was going to try to you know recuperate oh goodness and then on top of that i had i i got food poisoning i couldn't believe it i was like what did i do push the self destruct button here or something bless your heart i couldn't believe it it was just miserable well if you're feeling better now well yeah still kind of am weak and shaky i just in fact tonight's my first solid food since Saturday um bless your heart but uh i mean they've got me on a bland diet until i kind of get back on my feet i'm you know had um-hum a a boiled egg and a you know a dry baked potato which is kind of gross but you know um-hum well anything though to get some nourishment nourishment down you yeah exactly i mean because it's been saltine crackers and 7-Up uh for three two days um-hum um did you try to go to work today yeah i worked today i i just you know there working towards year end there's just so much going on that that you can't afford to be gone you know um-hum i know um-hum i understand so it's really kind of wild well you want to talk about fishing sure and then maybe we can gab a little when we get through okay all right here we go okay Susan what kind of fishing do you like let's see uh the only kinds i've ever done are just regular you know fishing in the lake or i have actually fished for Brook Trout in Colorado but um-hum oh i've always wanted to go deep sea fishing but i've never i can't ever get anybody to to go with me yeah you almost need to get several to go it it's so expensive to rent those boats yeah yeah i that's i that's what i hear is you know that you it's not too bad if you can put uh like eight people on a boat then it comes down to not being so expensive yeah um-hum but i also found out some more about it and i'm not sure i would enjoy it i don't know that i would really like you know fighting with a fish for for umpteen hours yeah that you know takes a lot of strength for that hours you yeah i i i like the kind where i sit on the bank and watch my bobber and when it goes down i pull a fish in yeah yeah that's the kind i like in fact that's the most successful i have ever i mean as far as ever ever catching a big fish that's how i caught one with um what did you catch um a a bass it was a well see i can't remember if it weighed three and a half pounds or five um five pounds or well that's a big fish i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish i've ever caught in my life you know that's wonderful i was so excited you know i was like screaming my father was running you know he saw the fish go flying through the air and i've never caught one yeah oh that part of it was kind of i don't know exciting yeah i was fishing with a little light reight weight rod and we'd been fishing down behind there's a place on the back side of this dam of this little lake that we it's a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and um-hum um-hum and they have have the water they let water drain off the back side of the dam through just kind of a um-hum i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were there's a little pond kind of a yeah um pool of water there that is pretty turbulent and it's usually pretty good fishing and mom and dad were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because i couldn't you know i wasn't catching anything yeah i know um-hum um-hum so i crossed the little road that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the creek runs on out there's a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i um-hum yeah thought to myself you know i mean this creek is about five feet across max and i thought you know um-hum i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldn't cast because the tree's hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of um-hum oh yeah held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in in and amongst the tree roots and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom altogether out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line um-hum um as i started going i realized i had something bigger than than i was equipped for because i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh man so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line with yeah yeah um  okay what do you feel are some of the main problems well i'm in a i'm in an urban area i'm in Dallas um-hum and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem uh even a more major problem uh in Dallas some of the major problems um drugs seems to be related related to quite a bit of the crime we have now there is a lot of theft a lot of assault dealing with uh people trying to get money for drugs yeah and uh i think that's a national problem though it's not unique it it it's pretty bad here too we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff and in Durham which is right next to Raleigh yes uh-huh well now we're pretty close to the golden triangle aren't you yeah that that Durham Raleigh and Chapel Hill is the triangle right research triangle and all of that and um right i'm sure you have a lot of students there uh and a lot of researchers so you you may have a you know perhaps a little better economic climate but in all your cities now it seems like there there's a a crowd that's really effected by this bill yeah it's it's really it's and and i've seen in more in Durham than i have in Raleigh or or really or Chapel Hill Chapel Hill is kind of a a ritzy city or whatever i mean it's kind of i'm i'm sure there's problems with it but it has a pretty low crime rate compare compared to to Durham has probably got the worst they've had like forty eight murders since the beginning of the year and over half of it's been drug related really hm well here uh i'm not sure how many Dallas has had i've uh Houston is averaging about two a week or three or four i I don't know a a number every week yeah uh Dallas is having quite a few it seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or or like i say drug related uh i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values seems like a a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to yeah um i well that and the and the economy's so bad and the economy is lousy and so many people have been laid off and stuff they've done special stories on the news local news here we've had a lot of bank robberies and different lot of break-ins and stuff um-hum i know like a week or so ago i live in a in a town house which is you know it's a pretty nice neighborhood and this lady was going to work she came home and everything in her house was total gone light fixtures everything and nobody thought any different they just thought she was moving it was a moving man pulled right up to her house broke in and stole everything she owned boy that really that really takes someone who's bold to do that well yeah it's it's it's pretty bad well now do you find that security is very good in in a in a town home um i would say so for the majority in in our in my little section of the neighborhood because there's always somebody at home and we all know one another and and on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that it's i i'm uh-huh well that i'm probably the one of the youngest people that live over here most people are are retired or or i see or you know they're they're in their forties or or whatever so and i'm in my twenties so i i'm i'm out more than they are but they're at home at night so i really don't worry about anything yeah well i think you hit on one point there is you know each other i'm i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything uh i am yeah oh about three blocks off a major road and uh a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs i guess you would say the neighborhood road it runs between the high school and the the commercial districts and uh i'm over the northeast part of Dallas and it's a in a nice neighborhood the houses here uh before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so and course everything's down ten to twenty percent now yeah see that's the same thing here but we have uh one one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away and now that the economy is bad they have trouble keeping those full so they've dropped the uh uh they're not nearly as selective as they used to be yeah and course that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex you start letting that happen and they go down and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things so uh i'm sure that aggravates it also yeah but unemployment now in Dallas or in Texas is up around six point  okay do we just go ahead okay um well we're supposed to talk about vacations and uh i'm trying to think of the ones that i've been on that i liked the most and uh-huh do you want to start right probably the one i liked most was Hawaii oh did you get to go to Hawaii yeah we went there for our twenty fifth wedding anniversary it's lovely isn't it yes yes we went uh six months after we were married uh huh and we just went to um two islands what islands did you go to we went to Oahu and Kauai Kauai uh-huh we went to Kauai and then we also hit Maui and then of course uh uh the big one uh-huh with uh the big one i thought was very commercialized the big one oh oh yeah it was but the other two were just lovely yes i enjoyed Kauai better too uh-huh it was quiet and restful and and so beautiful it wasn't commercialized oh it was rainy rainy but you know we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway so yeah was it that's right well it wasn't real rainy we had some a few showers but uh nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones and and when uh now we went to Nassau and my husband liked it better than he did Hawaii oh really oh uh-huh yeah he really did i don't know why you know he didn't like Oahu at all he thought he thought Honolulu was just horrible you know although we went to that Polynesian Village did you go there uh-huh oh uh-huh it's that was wonderful now we both enjoyed that very much um-hum uh-huh yeah that was that was nice you know i've been to Nassau too i went on a cruise have you oh neat uh-huh and um to tell you the truth i I think i'd rather just go to the island yeah uh our son and daughter-in-law just uh they got married last January and they won a cruise and i know they didn't like it now we have several friends that uh have been on and just love them but James and i like i don't know i think we would get bored on the boat all the time well i got sick yeah i did the first night i went with my sister just um a couple years ago and oh did you ooh uh-huh and we both the first night just had to leave dinner i it was bad but and then after that it was it got better we just it was a four day and we we were both ready to get off the boat yeah hm uh-huh were you well you know well i think if we ever go it will only be for a three day now we've been real lucky we've been to Europe twice oh have you yeah we went first time we went to London Paris and touched a little bit of Scotland and second time we went to Munich Germany and were there a week and loved Germany oh wow is just absolutely gorgeous with the mountains and we were there in the fall before the snows you know started and it was wonderful it uh it was just it was marvelous and we would love to go back there and we'd love to go back to London i'll bet it is oh you haven't been to Spain oh i was born there yes um just ten months yeah so no have not been to Spain were you how old were you when you left oh ten months uh-huh have you ever got to go back no no and i would like to yeah would you my uh my sister we went with them to Germany and uh she would like to go to Spain i'm not sure whether i would like to or not huh and uh i would like to go to Ireland would you now now i don't know if i'd like to go there just from the the problems uh-huh well uh the the unrest there is uh-huh is is a little scary but i would still like to see it i'd like to see uh Italy oh yeah that would be nice i would love to go there and course there's a lot of places in the United States i still want to come you know go to now have you been to Yellowstone uh Yellowstone have you uh yes yes we have been there we i was there as a child and then we we went to California and came back through Yellowstone with our kids and they loved it i was in Utah in Salt Lake City when i was a uh youngster uh-huh well oh uh-huh so uh you know i've touched on that and uh yeah now i'm just about oh a half hour um north of Salt Lake so um it's at my husband works in Salt Lake so we're real close and yeah we oh yeah uh-huh now that's a pretty city yes we we like it yeah it is very clean you know Utah's a pretty state from what i remember of it well we kind of like it well do you like to camp those kind of trips um-hum we no we used to we used to camp a lot with our kids and uh but now we like things like the Regency Hyatt we're we like the motels yes uh-huh oh you like the motels oh oh well we have we've gone past the camping stage we lived in Chattanooga Tennessee for two years and we did a lot of camping out there in the Smokeys and it was beautiful and our kids loved it and everything and then we moved to uh oh did you uh the Dallas area and uh it's hot down here and camping's not near as much fun uh-huh oh and uh so and then the kids were getting older and and uh were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside huh and uh although our son loves to fish and uh and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older uh-huh  so how is the weather out there um it's really cold and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had oh really you have breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff how about you guys hum um it's just it's a it's about same the usual i think oh so nice for skiing and all that kind stuff it's good yeah well the weather hm let's see well the snow here is different from Utah's because i've lived in Utah for like ten years oh really what part and um Provo i was going to BYU yeah and um the snow is like really cold i mean it's like really humid so it seems uh wetter or something like that than oh really okay it's more humid in Utah than there or there uh-huh it's more humid in Iowa than Utah yeah okay right okay and it seems like when the winds blow it's real it goes right through you it's really different from Utah's weather i thought Utah was cold but i think Iowa is a lot colder um yeah see that's how it is in Texas too because when it's cold it's really cold yeah i don't think there's any mountains to stop the wind so what's that i don't think there's any mountains to stop the wind right yeah so the humidity i think is what does it yeah i think that's true because i i noticed when i got here too because like i'd when it would snow in Texas um i would just i mean we'd be freezing really cold and we'd have to get really warm and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing and you you don't uh-huh yeah it is true you don't feel super cold it was weird but so how long ago did you graduate or did you or um i graduated in nineteen eighty seven oh really yeah my husband got his doctorate at BYU so that's and so he just graduated this past year oh so you just barely moved away uh-huh yeah we really miss well we really miss Utah we miss the mountains huh do you like it out there you do yeah because it's like really flat here well not flat but hilly and but no big mountains or anything um-hum so you just moved away a year ago um in August wow just really recent yeah but um let's see hum let's see what else can i say about the weather um well today was warmer it was like forty five oh warm so what's the temperature up today over there oh man it's got to be like it's probably fifty fifty five maybe oh really maybe not that warm probably about uh um yeah it's not it's not that cold really and whenever i remembered the weather reports in Utah i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill but they talk about wind chill here all the time because yep yeah yeah that's a big deal in Texas too they said it could be like six degrees outside and like negative forty one wind chill um so that's something we're not used to yeah that's true that's makes a big difference huh hm so oh i so did you used to ski when you were out here what's that did you used to ski when you were in Utah oh i've only i've only skied in Utah once i've only skied once my whole life oh really but do you do a lot of skiing there well um not tons but i like to when i get a chance i've only been once so far but had the opportunity a couple times since then uh-huh just saving my money for Christmas things and that yeah so is this your first year in Utah um no this is actually my third year and you're going to school there oh at U of U or uh-huh yep no at BYU oh really oh yeah so but i'll be here a long time at this rate what's your major um it was nursing but i'm in the process of changing it right now uh-huh oh because it's really really competitive at BYU you have to have like a three seven to get in so yeah that's true it's really i'm gonna look into some other fields i'd like all the science classes and that i'm just not really enjoying too much so i think i better get into something that i can enjoy the process uh-huh of going to school so yeah that's that's a good idea did you graduate in a certain field or um education i got a double major in uh elementary and special ed uh-huh really that's what my sister did yeah you might know her her name's Lori Bird oh really maybe not i think she graduated around then too though eighty seven probably but she got her double yeah well i can't there are so many girls in all my classes i can't remember how many people yeah yeah because they just since um stopped that program i mean where you can where you can get it doubled pretty easily oh have they oh i mean it's hard it's really  all right this is my opinion i i'm still a student right now and i'm actually studying in elementary education i think that there are quite a few problems with the school systems today uh-huh um more than anything i just believe that as students we're taught to learn what the teacher wants instead of actually um gaining a further vantage point and so it's basically we're taught to be mediocre in what we learn yeah um i'm also an education major i'm still in school and uh but i wanna go into teaching special ed uh-huh and um i think there is a lot of problems in that area a i think there is problems all over the education system whether it be uh-huh um elementary you know or even colleges you know have their flaws but especially in the learning disabilities because um a lot of times you know teachers think oh this kid's dumb and you know they just not too many people have knowledge you know about this area hum-um of uh type of kids you know because it's starting to become new and and they're starting to find out more research about um this type of learning um-hum and so yeah i think you're right i think that's really a a a really neat field i uh work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of the learning disabled uh-huh and it's incredible how they they can learn quickly if you just find what's right for them that's right and i think like you said at least in my opinion i think they put a lot of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them you know that's right it they're they hire teachers who aren't even qualified to teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast they don't wanna teach them um-hum and there's not enough teachers who want to do that and they're starting to find out you know oh this kid may have a learning disability they test them and find out that they do and then it's just a growing field because more and more kids are being tested into that i i think it's really interesting too i think along with the special children i have a friend who is gifted and in school he did terrible his all his years because there was no one who ever challenged or whoever found what exactly was what he needed in terms of learning uh-huh right and i think again it kind of goes back to the same thing of you know being mediocre in everything that we do right yeah like everybody not just people with problems um learn differently i mean you know one teacher can go out and learn how to teach but they only know one way and a kid might have um-hum problems you know learning that and comprehending well what does that mean i think it's i think more teachers should um right find different ways and be creative on their teaching well i think you're absolutely correct so you know i think personally like you said it it has more to do with the teachers coming out of their shell and not being afraid to make mistakes and saying you know hey i'm i'm gonna try this If it works great if it doesn't i apologize right um-hum and i i found in my own schooling that when the teachers made that special effort to to make the class exciting to make it different to to challenge my intellect or to to bring about a different method of teaching i was a lot more interested in learning yeah exactly what do you think about the grading systems and and how those work the grading system grading system um uh-huh well i think um well in a sense it's probably too easy but if it wasn't um-hum um these kids you know i mean nowadays a lot of kids they just you know don't try they don't get the grades that they could um-hum um-hum and um i don't do you think there's too much focus on grades grades instead of learning i don't yeah i think well the field i wanna go into grades to me doesn't mean much it doesn't tell you how intelligent you are how bright you are you know um um-hum right because i know somebody who's very bright and very intelligent but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have a learning disability um so yeah i think you have a good point there where they don't focus enough on them huh-uh um-hum how they learn and what they're learning you know not on the grade hm right yeah and i think at least as me as a college student i have a really hard time because you know they when you go out for a job or whatever they're gonna focus on your grades and i think again that a lot of the school problems are more society problems where they're not looking at the individuals as much much as they are just the whole overall picture right and you know like you said i i like the point that you brought up that that you said really it it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better um-hum yeah right and that's hard with a a large class you know with thirty kids you can't give them all your full attention but and you know i i wish there was a way i'm not sure of it um-hum  this is a real easy topic for me to spend at least thirty minutes or an hour on i vacation i don't think they'll let us talk that long yeah i know it i know it you say vacation i just say where i love to go i've and i've been lucky enough i've traveled quite a bit Canada Mexico oh my been to Rio uh Europe ooh you've been to Europe uh-huh that's wonderful i'm envious yeah i was i was lucky enough uh when i was uh twenty years old back when the the dollar was really strong i mean it was you know still the keen currency i convinced my parents to let me take off a month and go backpacking in Europe uh and uh that's memories you'll never ever have again probably it oh not never and uh you know and i've just i went everywhere and it's you know hum-um what was your favorite country uh well jeez if i had to pick one country i guess i would have to say Italy Italy huh uh-huh i think so because uh it was just the the history was just so staggering whenever you know you walked into the coliseum and uh you realized how many thousands of years old it was you know and you could just imagine the uh the gladiators and the lions and it was you know pretty pretty staggering to think of and then of course then the Roman forum that's even older than that that's just ruins and uh but the food was good the people were nice and there was just so much to see and do well that was probably before we were the ugly Americans too well actually back then like i said it was this is in nineteen seventy two and uh uh you know i did the whole trip uh airfare uh everything for less than a thousand dollars oh not even sure you could get airfare yeah right and i and i stayed gone a month golly yeah now of course that was back when uh Arthur for uh this uh the writer Arthur Arthur Frommer had a book out it was called Europe on five dollars a day yeah and so we budgeted and we said well we'll be extravagant we budgeted ten dollars a day i love it and and we stuck kept in that budget and had just really perfect wow who'd you go with i went with a friend of mine uh that i'd been in high school with actually he and i we were in college at the time and we were talking about going to Colorado taking a little trip uh up to Colorado that summer after school got out and we started adding up you know totaling how much it was going to cost and i said hell we could go to Europe for that he said well why don't we and i said you know we did i'm i'm really happy that that we did do that why don't we wow i've always wanted to go like to England well and i've i've i've been to England several times since then um and that is i could go back anytime um anytime well i teach literature and at the high school level and consequently i teach all about these wonderful places in Europe and in England especially and Canterbury Cathedral and you know all of these places and um-hum um-hum yeah yeah and never seen them somehow now that doesn't seem fair well well i um uh had a job for several years that i traveled just an awful lot and uh as a matter of fact i stayed gone more than i stayed at home yeah for about four years and i built up an awful lot of mileage so i've made three trips to London just using airfare you know airline mileage and so that's how i've been able to make make those trips um gee of all the places you visited then what is your one spot for a vacation that you would love to go back to i i would go back to uh if i could go back anywhere right now i think i would go back to Edinburgh um why is that and well because uh we i didn't go any farther north in Scotland than Edinburgh and uh my brother was over there a couple of years ago and he uh uh went to on a driving tour all up through the Scottish highlands and just came back just raving about how wonderful it was very very scenic very um-hum beautiful and it's it's a part of the uh the country that's a little bit off the beaten path there're not as many tourists that go out there and i enjoyed uh right Scotland so much but i could go back listen i could go back into London any day of the week and the beautiful thing about that is you could take a train out of London and head any direction it doesn't make any difference and take these fabulous day trips and anywhere you go is interesting and uh the last time we went we found this really uh small kind of quaint hotel actually we found it over there on the trip before but stayed in it the last time that was reasonable reasonable and uh just used that as a base and then took day trips on the trains the train system is wonderful which makes me wonder when we'll ever get our act together here in the US and have a and have a decent um uh transportation system but we'd just take day trips and that was that was a nice way to do it isn't that the truth did you go to Germany i have been yeah we went the first time i went over there i went to Germany and went to Munich and stayed right across the street from one of the original medieval beer halls oh my goodness and uh
