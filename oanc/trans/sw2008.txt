 um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where we've left out about thirty four million people oh and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i i have a feeling since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because it's gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway yeah because when people can't pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know well it seems to me that that i'm paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high oh definitely and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently don't have the money or the wherewithal to do that right yeah yeah would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is and myself i guess yeah yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a good idea my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i don't know do we wind up with more red tape and more problems so yeah yeah well well who who else is gonna do this then i mean it's worked successfully in Europe i've heard all these stories about i travel extensively um-hum and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and i find that the health care programs there oh uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if i'm injured or yeah have an emergency when i'm say in Germany or France uh that i'm automatically taken care of i mean i don't even have to pay wow yeah well i think part of the the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money until you know they have no preventative measures because people um you know just go on and on and on i mean so many people don't even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if if it what what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in in public hospitals is addicted to crack well you know well i uh uh i i i know it i have a solution you see uh my my solution even though i'm rapidly approaching the uh the age when i'll qualify for Medicare and Medicaid i i my mother and father both uh uh well my father's not living but my mother is um-hum and they are um of of an advanced years and when i see the money that's poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts yeah i know that because those people vote i mean they're the ones who get out and vote that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal prenatal care the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think yeah yeah and we're spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people oh it's just unbelievable how much you go through when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time it was just strange that's right i mean it does seem like we're the the the now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i guess oh well that should help well i don't know uh we'll see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but we'll see what happens yeah oh i see oh gosh well listen uh i think i've i've exhausted my uh self on at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it okay well okay thank you bye-bye okay see you next time bye  i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now i've lost track i don't really know i i do have some opinions but go ahead yeah um well i know that they're they're real cautious about letting Middle Eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism what do uh what what okay i hadn't thought about that uh what all do you know about it uh well i just have an opinion now i didn't think i i thought the terrorism thing was overstated i mean there was nothing over here in fact even this is not our subject i guess but uh or maybe it is or isn't i suppose yeah my wife when she talked about the Middle East and everyone's afraid you know of how the war was going to go and everything i said i said i told her i said no it's just not going to happen there's not going to be any terrorism over here and there wasn't you know they they just didn't have an organization but uh i i concerned i'm concerned that we're letting too many that we don't have enough controls i think that uh the Asian gangsters that we've let in here and if and the guys from uh Cuba you know there there's a lot of criminals down in Florida that we've let in from Cuba that Fidel pushed off on us and uh um-hum and and the last you know out of all the Asians we brought in there there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from from Asia and i think that there's got to be some sort of controls over that i mean this Asia mafia thing is getting out of hand that's right um-hum i i don't i don't i didn't know what i don't even know what our controls are i don't even know what uh uh we if we have any guidelines at all uh on on immigration um i always thought that we did but i don't i don't i don't i don't know what they are right now there i don't think there's much of much of one because i'm sure all the people from Cuba have been released from that camp that they were in yeah and uh most of them it's just like Australia most of them were criminals from Cuba and i think that was just an attempt that that Fidel Castro to undermine you know yeah the United States to some extent so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us yeah the yeah and it's almost the same thing in in uh from Asia because a lot of a lot of them was put out of business in Vietnam after the war and because we i i do have some sympathy with uh you know of course we have this big Mexican problem not a problem but i think that we need to do something with uh the immigration of back and across forth across Mexico uh um-hum i uh i'm sympathetic i don't know what the answer is i guess i'm sympathetic certainly with that that that they they want to come over here and they i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work and if if they have if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away American jobs but i don't know uh i don't know how many American jobs they are really taking away i'm so i i'm sympathetic but i don't have an answer i don't uh right um-hum i think that we should have good relations with with Mexico but that's not really exactly immigration it is and it isn't uh i i don't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens owe owe the children education and all that uh although the idea their education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world so um-hum i guess it's what they their the Mexican kids get a good education along the way maybe that's a benefit to everybody you know yeah and uh a lot of the Mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work um-hum and they have green cards and uh then like you said a lot of i run into people every day that can't speak English oh yeah and uh and and most of them you know are working in janitorial positions so yeah and that so i i don't know you like you said i don't know how much how much they're taking from the work force you know yeah i never thought that they were much i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had um-hum uh um uh of course you mentioned the language i i feel so bad that we here in Texas or certainly the southern part of the United States uh California Texas and all that just why our kids don't speak fluid Spanish uh by junior high you know um as well as us you know hm um-hum so that we could wouldn't have a language barrier certainly now that is a shame that we uh have this tremendous border of Mexico and then in Europe you know they they speak their French and all and they try they go out of their way to try to speak their their neighbor's language so they can understand we we certainly we don't really even make an effort um-hum to speak Spanish and i feel bad about that uh go ahead well that's i yeah i took Spanish in school and that's you know one reason that i did it is because yeah because whenever you travel anywhere near the border you know there more and more people speak Spanish yeah i guess it's never too late i i do have some Spanish books and i've always uh every year i say i'm going to try to speak uh some newcomers language you know i don't know if it's costing us any money or how much money they're putting into it uh that's always a factor i mean how much my wife says they how much the federal government is putting into well yeah well it's basically on the well i think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders and uh it's more um the immigration is tied in with uh drug trafficking so immigration they have to watch out who comes in and and they're always finding drugs on you know on the most um innocent looking kind of yeah i forgot what they found but a dog found it the other day you know on on the border oh yeah oh yeah i i think that certainly is a problem uh i guess our immigration history that's a great subject uh they didn't say to talk about that but that is i mean uh on Ellis Island they you know they're redoing that and going to make it a museum a national museum um-hum now that certainly was interesting since all of us had uh ancestors that came over that way or not all but i guess uh i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a uh a boat originally you know but uh a lot of us have parents grandparents my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that and i'm sure they came over you know through Ellis Island you know that's right yeah so uh we all immigrants in one way or or another well we certainly are coming from Europe you know or not yeah yeah and one of the one of the things that really gets to me uh about the Mexicans is that um once they have children over here their children are American citizens then oh yeah that those were laws are unusual you know yeah and then they'll ship the parents back and that leaves the children without any parents so yeah that i don't understand i mean uh whose rule is that you know and they you know and they and and they just follow the rule no matter you you know so that doesn't seem fair to the children yeah sometimes common sense should take over rather than yeah that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all right that you would do it that way um-hum you would think they could at least get a a a visa or something until they uh got citizenship i'm sure they want to yeah and then they granted them amnesty if they could prove when was that and it was in the eighties sometime if they if they could prove they'd been here five years oh yeah i heard something about that yeah and uh a lot of them had been you know some of them some of them moved back and forth but uh yeah yeah most of them don't ever want to go back to Mexico especially the way it was then oh no oh no i i could see uh you can see why um-hum i don't know how much immigration we have from Europe and everything what the controls are i think most you know like especially the celebrities and everything they just have a uh well they have to get a green card if they're going to do any kind of work you know in the movies and yeah and such but most of them have temporary visas yeah i guess you can get work visas pretty easily uh as long it's like well it's it's a kind of a a bad a bad example but when Rafael Septien took the job with the Cowboys they had to offer his job to any other applicant that could do it yeah oh really yeah so that you know and that's the thing with the jobs yeah and of course no one beat him out so you know yeah he just ruined his own career so oh well yeah yeah yeah well it's it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the one of the few countries that people are still you know desperately trying to immigrate to uh although i guess Europe now that the Communism is falling apart that maybe there'll be won't be that much of a rush to get out of all the Communist Communist countries uh i guess Poland now is now a non Communist so um-hum maybe not maybe immigration from Europe to here will slowly you know slowly uh change maybe it'll be even out like trade you know so many people will immigrate here in in the twentieth at at the year two thousand so many of the people who will go back overseas you know maybe it'll average out i don't know yeah i think so it doesn't has doesn't seem so far but because there are other uh job uh uh job opportunities in Europe that there aren't here and um-hum you know even um like orchestra orchestra players can find a job sometimes in Europe when they can't find one here and um i'm a trumpet player um-hum are you a teacher uh no i uh i don't anymore i just went to school and i was a music major for a while oh really yeah but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the Mexico City Symphony so so he had to have a work visa there yeah oh and of course they had a lot of musicians from from other countries and uh in the Mexico City Symphony um-hum um-hum but i think um like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from Mexico now oh really but i think the conductor i don't know or one of the conductors is is from another country um-hum it's like any other symphony yeah you know and then and Eduardo Mana's from Mexico so so he had to you know  i think i get most of my news uh in headlines from the radio and then i follow up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention well i i do about the same i guess but in a different fashion i i i'm from New York originally and now that i live in Florida i live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the in the summertime um-hum and i i feel that the the only legitimate paper although it might sound a little elitist is the New York Times i've always read the New York Times when i was younger and i try to find now that it has a national edition i read that i also read uh i i i guess i do watch uh McNeil Lehrer on P B S because i i lean to that coverage and and i've guess i'm uh-huh i like them but they take so long i don't always have time yeah well yeah that's a whole hour show actually it's an hour show each evening and and uh we we turn it on when we start dinner we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up uh-huh i find that i'm leaning on uh i travel a great deal uh even overseas and i find that i lean on uh C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff and i'm i'm i i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out i mean i i don't believe everything they say but it's it's coverage you know yeah i think C N N does a pretty good job i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad until the Gulf War yeah yeah and they seemed to have the best coverage they had more information sooner than most of the other networks uh well yeah i i i uh Peter Arnett was reporting direct from uh Iraq i think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him i i think that what he he reported what he saw and if you didn't like it that was just too bad you know yeah yeah well uh i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted but i think they said that frequently enough that you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective uh yeah oh yeah i mean i no that that's right i think so and and i guess if it comes to um to magazines i don't read i used to when i was younger i subscribed to Time and U S News and World Report i i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper or i i i also subscribe to something called World Press which is uh a magazine that only talks about other uh excerpts from the world press which sort of gives you a different slant than it's not um-hum as slanted as the New York Times or as biased perhaps as a local paper yeah but uh that i guess and the radio uh i listen to P B S radio a lot and i also listen to uh these twenty four hour news stations when i'm driving i yeah we have a C B S twenty four hour station that i listen to on the way to and from work and yeah do you read uh are you from southern or northern California northern i'm from uh the peninsula Palo Alto so so well yeah is that what is that the San Francisco paper out there is uh the major paper well it's horrible The San Francisco paper is just wretched yeah that's a terrible paper so i subscribe to the San Jose Mercury News um uh Palo Alto is about midway between well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper and is that pretty good oh the what is that the Chronicle isn't it yeah there's the Chronicle and the Examiner but they're uh both run by the same people oh oh yeah they just they really are probably the worse papers i've ever read i they're just horrid so we read the yeah well can you get the L A paper up there that's a pretty decent paper isn't it or uh we can but i don't like it so we subscribe to the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and the Mercury News yeah yeah yeah well that's another one i read i forgot that i read the Wall Street Journal not as in depth as i used to because they their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer but yes well again i read that uh two columns on the front yeah uh i think i i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff i feel pretty well versed in in what i'm doing because i i do spend more time on that than i do say on sports or um-hum although i watch that i spend a lot of time reading about these things i'm quite interested i find it very exciting to for the coverage we have now today yes and i think we do get pretty good coverage i don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the uh the news coverage the if anything they i think they listen we almost have too much well i don't know i i hear a lot of criticism about listening to these the Dan Rathers of the world and and listening and taking their word for it or their comment actually they i think they slant things but well i cannot stand Dan Rather i remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston and i hated him then no kidding oh well i didn't know that yeah and i would not watch that man for money and he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach so yeah yeah was was he uh i watch Peter Jennings and uh and Tom Brokaw sort of alternate yeah well how do you feel about it i guess i i got to say if that's the subject if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to i don't know if if it said that i feel i'm well enough equipped do we get enough news or something like that do we get uh the do we get the news that we want and i do i really think yeah to yeah yeah i think i do too i think you have to let uh you yous got to segregate some of it yeah well that's about all i have to say okay well nice to talk to you bye bye nice talking to you bye bye  okay uh do you work yes i do what do you do uh i'm a data manager at a manufacturing company that makes landing gear oh well do they have good job benefits yes they do very good uh comparable i used to work for TI and i used to work for Martin Marietta and they are comparable to them um as good or better huh uh-huh what do do you work no i don't oh okay uh i said my husband works on the railroad they've got a lot of benefits but it's expensive uh-huh this uh the insurance is a kick in the tail every month really um-hum well i uh my insurance is is very reasonable where i work and course the it would well the insurance is good we only have to pay like a hundred dollar deductible per year it's just it's uh uh-huh it's like a hundred dollars a month oh is it really yeah well i mean well that's just well i i chose an HMO and mine only runs five dollars a uh five dollars a month well this is uh like retirement benefits and it's a bunch of different benefits in one it's not just oh i see it's not just medical insurance okay well i pay five dollars a month for my medical and then we have a retirement uh benefits package a profit sharing type of thing they match our uh we can put in up to fifteen percent and they'll match uh sixteen six percent one hundred percent you know so that is that's better than most companies do that's great yeah that's good plus plus they you know we have bonds we have a credit union it's a fairly it's not a real large company well it is it's part of a large company it's a subsidiary of a large company and um-hum whoops i'm sorry we have three different that's my call's waiting they'll just have to call back uh we have uh uh we're part of a i'm sorry company in we have a company in California and a company in Canada and this company here and uh so we have about five hundred employees at each place they do uh so it's that's about fifteen hundred all together then we but we're a a subsidiary of a of a larger company so we have all the benefits that all the big large companies have i don't know any that we don't have i don't know a lot about benefits most of the jobs that i've had you know were i don't have a degree i quit college when i first got pregnant with my little boy oh uh-huh i plan on going back just i want to wait for my kids to grow up now yeah and uh uh i'm sorry so all i've had was mainly fast food jobs and i worked at a toy store and i worked at TI for a while but it was for Manpower so that's all right oh uh-huh i liked working at TI i worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Florida and worked at Martin Marietta in Orlando for four years and then i got oh you're in Florida i was no i'm in Texas uh i left Martin Marietta for this company here in Fort Worth it's i'm in Grapevine right now but oh okay i work in Fort Worth and they just offered me such a fantastic deal i i just couldn't turn it down there wasn't any way i could turn it down they they moved me and they paid for every i mean they paid for everything my license my driver's license my all my utilities at my home plus you know paying to move my furniture and my license tags everything i just you know and plus a huge salary increase and i thought God i'd be stupid if i don't take this and i wanted to come back to Texas anyway so well that's great and like i say they have all those same benefits that Martin Marietta and TI had so um i've what did you say you did again a computer a data i'm a data manager huh and it well i took data processing in college oh did no this is a lot of people think that it has something to do with computers and it really doesn't i mean i do have a computer but it it really doesn't have anything to do with computers it's data that uh is generated like reports test reports financial reports all kinds of reports that that uh a project would generate uh now it's my job to see that contractually contractually these people you know deliver them on time and i have to make sure that they they do get delivered and that's that's what my job is and it's that's that kind of data instead of instead of computer data well that sounds great though what did you do at TI yeah uh-huh i was a a configuration manager at at TI which was similar well it was uh similar but wasn't i mean i it was uh doing uh it was a little bit more technical configuration management management it's a little bit more technical than what i'm doing now and i liked it but it was a it was a job that i always felt like i didn't have control of you know what i mean i never felt like i'd mastered that job and when i moved to Florida i moved down there as a configuration manager right and stayed there from uh stayed at that job for quite a while until i got an opportunity to go into data management which i and i've been in that ever since and love it i mean that's just my cup of tea the configuration manager was right oh i hate to feel out of control of anything oh i do too and i really did i'd sit there and you know when people asked me what i did i never could really tell them what i did because i didn't know because i you know i was doing the job yeah you played it by ear and i was getting good raises and my boss even goes you even got non periodic raises but i really just felt so control out of control hum so but anyway i'm and i like i say i've always been with a company that's had a lot of benefits so uh and and when you get older now i know when you're younger my daughter just doesn't realize it but i wish i had when i was younger thought about retirement but you know you think oh that's twenty years away from now who's going to worry about it well i um-hum well me and my husband are we've talked about it we're having six dollars a day taken out of his check for retirement that's good that's smart i wish i could talk my daughter into realizing that she works at TI also well that's and she needs yeah at the TI in Sherman or no she works at the Expressway site uh SC Building okay well uh and uh um that's about the only thing we're doing for retirement now when i worked i wanted to go to TI i was wanting to become a TIer that way i could get some benefits because most the jobs around here you can't get benefits uh-huh yeah i know isn't that a shame especially if you well if you don't have a degree or something right but i'll go back to school one of these days and i will get me a see well i was uh forty five before i got my degree i uh started back when i was it took me nine years i was about thirty something before i even went back to school or even started college um-hum and i was forty five when i finally graduated well i was eighteen and i went and got my GED i quit the high school i just couldn't stand it and then course i hated it two years after i quit i wish i'd never done it uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah yeah but then i i went and got my GED and i went to school and then i i loved college i was making a three point oh average i wasn't having hardly any problems except for with my computer class i did have problems there but uh really yeah now i was then i was old enough to know you know well i'm paying for it i've got to um-hum you know do something with it but then i wanted to stay home with the babies so yeah i stayed home with my kid i think i guess the longest i ever stayed home was eight years i stayed home with my kids and uh my son went ahead and graduated from college and my daughter has quite a few hours but she bless her she and her husband are you know kind of struggling he's a policeman they're both having and she works a second job too so she really doesn't have time i guess if she wanted to make time she could but and eventually i think she'll go back when it really means something to her but right now that's not foremost and her she likes being with her little girl well we're having a hard time right now too but it's just who if the kid if kids don't have direction if their mother ain't home directing them through the day kids are growing up wild nowadays oh i know it i know it my mom had to work and i i can feel the difference um a lot of um-hum well my husband had somebody to push him his mother was able to stay home with him more and you know he got his life straight at an early age which i'm not a i never i never went wild or anything but yes um-hum i still don't know what i want to be when i grow up and i'm twenty seven years old i know it that's me i here am i in my fifties and i still don't know what i want to do but my my mother didn't work she was always home so and it didn't i guess really looking back yeah um-hum knowing that she was always there when we got home from school my mother was there and now what i did when my kids were growing up since i had to work i worked nights i was home i was sleepy but i was home when they got home from school um-hum yeah that's what's important isn't it you have to while i'm when they start going to school now my baby's just three months old and i'm not having any more so yeah uh-huh i'm going to be there for them at least until they're in the second well until the baby starts uh-huh school preschool uh kindergarten not preschool yeah which it don't take long it seems like just yesterday that my little boy was born and he's fixing to go to school next year oh is he yeah they're all growing up your your husband works for the railroad you say yeah he sure does oh now do do they have pretty good benefits there besides uh yeah their medical and dental is real good and uh like i said they do make it easy for you to that's where a lot of our money is going is toward his retirement but i want we'll like that once you know we get older is it sure oh yeah absolutely and we'll need it and like i said that's six dollars a day and oh i haven't really sat down and figured it out but i guess it'd be pretty easy three times six is what eighteen uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah so it's a hundred and eighty a month oh once i did well yeah that'll add up fast fast fast absolutely yeah you're smart in doing that i would never quit that yeah no well it's it's like this we don't see it so we don't really miss it well i've started uh that's right that i went the other day and had them start taking some money out of my uh savings my checking at work to in to put into savings account plus i buy a two hundred dollar a month a bond a month so they'll and they'll stack up faster than you realize uh-huh yeah now i wish they had that bond here i know that they had that at TI for the TI uh-huh  all right so uh what about automobiles well i drive a pick up truck uh-huh and uh you should live in Texas that's probably true it it's a small pickup truck though it's one of those Isuzu uh space cab types with a sunroof so it's actually not a real pickup truck you know it's uh it's got nice bucket seats so it's very comfortable and uh uh-huh it has uh with the space cab in the back i can carry some storage but i have to admit Fred i i've never had a gun rack back there so i probably wouldn't fit in Texas uh oh you're in trouble you don't have a Yosemite Sam mud flap back off or anything like that no no no no nothing like that it my it's pretty pretty i think uh my truck sort of puts me as a uh as as a Baltimore Baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat uh-huh and i needed something that would be able to haul a small boat but then i i um i because i wanted to try water skiing and enjoying some water sports and things and that's one reason why i bought it but then right after i bought the truck i broke my foot and i and the doctor said because of the type of physical therapy i got no sideward movement you know for a couple of months and that meant the whole yeah season uh water skiing you know uh season was over so i thought well okay and then by the the next year i was thinking about doing it again but i invested the money in a house oh well probably that's probably a little more sound investment you know so little more sound investment yes so so then i still have this pickup truck and then i think well now maybe i'll you know go by the boat again and of course then i broke my foot again uh so the thought perhaps you should just uh dispel that thought yeah that so that's so i'm not ever going going to own a boat but you still like your truck though yeah oh yeah i love my truck in fact uh well my wife and i contemplate selling both of us owned pickup trucks actually when we got married so we now we're a two pickup truck family uh hers in in some ways is is a little more convenient and then mine's convenient other ways so it's hard to decide she has a a cap on the back and and uh she has um uh roof racks so we were able to carry things on the roof and able to put things in the back of her truck without them ever worrying about them them getting wet or whatever uh-huh right but with mine see i have a space cab so you can put like luggage immediately behind the seats and i also have bucket seats and air conditioning so each one has its good points and each one has its bad points in a two truck family yeah uh what yeah do you feel that uh you're the always the guy that gets called when someone moves or something i think family um i do a little bit but surprisingly i have uh two of my brothers since i bought my Isuzu pickup two of my brothers have bought uh Isuzu Troopers which actually you know can open the back and just take out your backseat and you can haul washers and dryers and almost anything in them so i think um i used to be uh-huh the one that was called but now everybody owns one themselves you know i do have some friends every once in a while that'll ask me and i'll i'll of course do that you know that doesn't matter yeah yeah it's for for a friend you'd do it anyway so it doesn't really matter yeah that's uh it just seems that uh i don't know if i'd ever want to own one because i know i've used guys with pickup trucks two or three times and and they you know what are you doing this weekend well i'm helping a guy move you know and it just seems like they're always getting the call uh-huh yeah that's true what type of car do you drive Fred well i have a eighty five Mercury Cougar and i've had it since well eighty six actually so it was still fairly uh-huh you know it was a new style when it came out and uh my wife drives and eighty seven Topaz or an wait an eighty eighty seven Topaz yeah that's right and so we're a Mercury family i guess yeah uh-huh uh-huh um not so much on her part but i don't know my dad always bought Ford and Mercury products so and i like the looks of the Cougar yeah yeah they're nice looking i like them yeah thanks and uh except for i got a some Texas hail storm damage it's a little golf ball action so i've got oh really driving driving around a with a Chinese checker board basically oh gee i got that about a year and a half ago actually two years ago this May and i just totaled out the car um-hum and uh so it paid for itself and i'm basically driving uh almost a free car so yeah well that's see that's what i'm hoping to stop paying truck payments soon you know that's i think that's payments are important what you so but your wife drives a Mercury Topaz they're nice too yeah we haven't had a trouble with either of them yet uh her Topaz uh um-hum uh my Cougar's got like eighty some thousand miles on it it's made trips because we're both from Indiana and she moved down here first she she pardon um-hum yeah so you've gone yeah back to visit family have you driven back to visit family in Indiana uh yeah uh-huh yeah i've made the trip probably ten times because i was still going to school and she was down here and so it's uh-huh it's just racks up you know about sixteen hundred miles each time yeah and and we just started going in Carla's car the Topaz and it seems to make the trip pretty well it's getting around thirty five forty miles per gallon oh that's really good yeah yeah it is especially we we were weighting it down a little bit it get it you know on the um-hum it averaged out around thirty five or forty forty yeah is uh gas mileage an important reason why you buy the cars you do probably uh the Cougar i got it just for its looks um-hum and uh the the Mercury brand and uh Carla wanted a a car that got good gas mileage a little something to get around town and uh dependable and uh um-hum uh it it it's kind of a sportier model than most Topazes it's got the the stripping on the side and it came with uh i think Eagle tires um-hum yeah some guy had some salesman had decked it out and uh yeah so it it looked pretty sharp well i i take it you don't have you don't have kids then no no we we just got a new puppy but uh it's close enough because if you had if you had kids you wouldn't say anything about sportier looking you'd be saying things like it has a good backseat uh the car seat fits in very easily and we can seat belt it in securely it's that's that's a big difference in conversations there yeah oh so you don't you don't have children or no we well we're uh just recently married in December oh okay uh but that's we we laugh now my wife says we should sell my truck and i say we should sell hers and i said well the reason why we should sell yours Laura is because see mine has the space cab and it actually has little drop seats in the space area with seat belts i said and we can seat buckle in a car seat there yeah so we should get rid of yours because the three of us won't be able to go on trips i said but we can go on trips in mine you know we can travel anywhere with my truck so that's uh you know we laugh i laugh about that um-hum that's funny uh see that's true i never thought of that and yeah you know oh it's a good child and you know loading up the kids you know we haven't crossed that yet so i know we haven't either but have you seen these new station wagons they look pretty sharp well what the Ford ones uh i don't know what it was i just saw it going down and mom and the kids were in there and it looked like a pretty sleek looking car yeah i think uh i think Ford was one of the first ones to step into that new um that new almost shuttle space shuttle like appearance and i think they've done they've really come on strong with some of that um yeah yeah uh wind resistance and energy saving and uh uh developments i think that that's their station wagon i think those are Fords but i do i like those okay no more of the the panel station wagons anymore yeah yeah now now the station wagon looks sleek it looks yeah i know they do look pretty sharp and uh and hopefully i think uh you know it's supposed to get better gas mileage and um i think that's that's becoming an important thing too my wife and i've been discussing is you know looking for a car when we do get rid of one of the trucks we'll probably look for a car that gets good gas mileage uh-huh just because um it it just has become such an important thing i think for the environment and for the economy and everything you know to start to pay attention to that more and more so you you bought an Isuzu so you're not a a the buy American crowd or no i think i think the reason why i i bought the Isuzu is because you know i looked almost all the small trucks are made by Japanese anyway uh-huh there's only a couple of them like i looked the first place i went were the were Dodge Chrysler Plymouth and you know i went to a number of them and i priced them all out and i was just the the i was almost going to buy a um a Chrysler which was actually a Mitsubishi truck uh-huh but the salesman insulted me um the guy the salesman you know they always do that deal with you where they say well i got to go talk to my manager well here the manager's actually the guy that owns the place and in this small town we live on he's always on TV uh-huh and he comes out of his office and i asked him for i i i said well you know it was like maybe eighty three hundred dollars for this truck yeah and i said well i i'd like it for eight thousand dollars i said for eight thousand dollars i'll sell you know i'll write out the down payment now and you know because i can get financing i can get financing through my credit because i'd checked about financing and everything you know i said i'll for eight thousand dollars i'll take it you know because it was oh sort of marked down you know and the and the guy came out of the back and insulted me he said he said you want a truck for under eight thousand dollars go back to the used lot it's behind the building and he walked away oh man i guess it was a sales technique he thought he was going to pressure me into giving up that three hundred dollars that i asked for i don't know and i said i said i looked at the salesman i said i'm i'm sorry your boss just insulted me i can't it's against my pride to buy a truck here now that no kidding and guy and i felt really bad i walked out and the guy called me at home the next couple of days it was terrible but you know i walked out i got into my brother was actually with me shopping for a car and we drove down the street and he said why don't you just look in here and we went into the Isuzu dealer because my brother always had this love for an Isuzu Trooper he wanted one you know uh-huh and we walked in and here there was a demonstrator model on sale like ninety six hundred dollars with everything standard  okay well what movies do you like gosh i like just about anything we i think the last one we saw was uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Part 2 oh now i love i like the turtles my little boy's four and he loves them well we don't have any kids but we like them anyway oh that's okay how old are y'all well um we're late twenties oh and you just don't have any yet okay well i've got two no oh gosh yeah my little girl is three months old and my little boy just turned four i had his birthday party yesterday oh but he's a turtle fanatic he even had turtle cake yesterday but i've been wanting to see Turtle too is it as good as they say it is it was it was actually better than the first one i thought good what's the last movie you saw Ghost oh we were just when when the topic came up we i was asking my husband right quick what's the last movies we saw he said well Ghost and Turtles i really liked it now Ghost yeah i love tear jerker movies but that wasn't too bad on tear jerker but not too awful bad it was oh it was good movie though i can see why it won so many Oscars because that was just so good and i like Demi Moore yeah did you see Pretty Woman no but i've been hearing a lot about it i don't we don't get to the video store very often and we don't have cable oh gosh well we don't really want cable it's just you know glued to the TV all the time anyway so we get two channels down here thanks i'm from Kentucky originally and we used to get five channels without cable yeah uh-huh yeah you know forty well uh i don't think y'all have the same channels but here in Texas we only get two channels and that's um do you watch soap operas uh once in a while when i'm home okay you work then okay well we get the channel with Young and the Restless on it yeah okay and then uh i think General Hospital and that comes on different channel yeah it does but that's all we get and that's no cartoons for my little boy but we've got a VCR and a lot of tapes yeah and uh my husband's a movie fanatic i think you'd really like Pretty Woman it was it was really a it made you feel really good it was just a happy movie oh what about Total Recall have you seen that yeah oh i saw that one that's good i i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was yeah it was violent i try to get away from that my little boy oh he loves Robocop yeah and that movie i have to i'll fast forward it everytime they come to the part where there's have you seen it yeah the part where they're shooting Mercy i don't like that that it oh that's horrible that is horrible and their their the language on that's filthy i don't see why they have to do that i mean yeah i mean know everybody knows that it that the the language is there so they could just ignore it and you know yeah use different words instead i think yeah yeah i know but i i think lately Pretty Woman's been my favorite i went and bought the video i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times um my husband bought me like um uh i think Pretty in Pink for my birthday with a wait a second the uh i will in a minute Kyle sorry um he bought me pretty in pink just a second that's okay Kyle i'm on the telephone i'll be right i'll be right there sorry now you're glad you ain't got a four year old that's okay it this the first time he's interrupted my phone calls now now i haven't seen Pretty in Pink that had um Molly Ringwald yeah it was cute but it wasn't i like the um Sixteen Candles or sixteenth birthday or does that have Molly Ringwald i think i think Sixteen Candles was the name of it yeah oh that was so good of course i was a teenager when i seen that and i loved it i haven't seen it either oh well if you like love stories it's sweet oh it's sweet i do it really is and that's a tear jerker it gets you i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her but it's hilarious too especially with that uh little guy in it oh he looks like a little oh gosh i don't know he looks like a little boy next door oh but he's sixteen oh it's a cute movie i can't remember his name he kind of looks like Doogie Howser hm i don't know don't know either he's got curly blonde hair he just a little freckly little but probably know him if i saw him boy yeah if i could remember the name i know you'd know his name because he's played in a few movies but uh i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was um Sleeping with the Enemy okay i've heard about that but i can't remember it that that's that's Julia Roberts' new movie okay yeah Julia Roberts is good yeah she's this one you know Pretty Woman was kind of a light comedy uh-huh and a romance and and this one was a lot more dramatic wasn't it a murder mystery it it well it like sort of it was like uh it was a mystery it was a mystery she disappeared from her husband uh husband who was abusing her oh okay the yeah that's the one i wanted to see where he was on she was on a carnival at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something yeah yeah well did that come on TV or did it come out in the no it came out in the theater oh well and i think you know around here it's already quit playing but i don't i don't know if it's still playing anywhere else oh i i'd like but it was it was it was one of those that kept you on the edge of your seat real good i want to see that yeah i seen the uh previews for it on TV down here it's but it's just been down here a couple weeks i think oh okay because we saw it probably yeah four or five months ago a month is well i know it hasn't been that long since i've seen the previews for it but yeah i wanted to see it her husband was that was a dark haired guy with a beard and moustache or yeah he's uh he was a real psycho in the movie it was it was scary and no he shaved the beard off yeah oh i'd like to see that what about oh there was a we got one back here a while oh i want to see War of the Roses too have you seen that oh yeah boy uh i i didn't like it no it was i didn't like the way it ended you didn't i know well the only reason i know why it ended is on Arsenio Hall one night Christopher Reeves uh-huh told that you know i can't believe they killed them or or or who was it Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas might have been Michael Douglas oh that starred in it yeah it was Michael Douglas yeah Christopher Reeve wasn't in it at all huh-uh okay well Arsenio Hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them and Christopher Reeve or Mike Douglas went after his throat you dummy so i know that they die but i haven't told my husband we've both been wanting to see it it was i i it was it was weird it was a different movie from anything i've ever seen that's what well we was uh teasing about you know splitting our house down the middle yeah they did that didn't they and they marked off routes that they could go or something yeah that'd be kind of hard for us we've only got one bathroom i don't we've got two bathrooms but well it might actually if he takes my my house kind of looks like two trailers put together and one bathroom is at the end of of one side and one's in the middle of the other so we could do it oh well that wouldn't be too bad no and he could climb out the window well and we our whole house has you know every room leads to did three rooms so we can you know yeah well yeah you can get around you just can't go out the front door honey sorry get around well did you see Fatal Attraction yeah that's coming back on too i know it's going to be on on the on CBS Tuesday night and and that's kind of what in a way you know how it kind of bothered you the way it ended and stuff that's kind of how War of the Roses was uh-huh hm well parts of parts of War of the Roses was funny but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling you know eerie feeling or i want to see it though i'd like to see that and uh The Never Ending Story came out on Disney this month i think i wanted to see that i i've heard about that but i don't know what it's about The Never Ending Story it's a child's movie but oh it's good i enjoyed it yeah i love Disney movies yeah i do too and i mean they're some of the best of that are made yeah yeah and uh well it's about this little boy who uh i think he's up in a attic or some part of school he got locked in the school and he got scared but he starts dreaming and this oh he's saving the land of uh oh it's been so long since i've seen it all i know is all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing it flies through the air and he's trying to save the land from some ooze but it's really good i mean it sounds kind it it had uh Fred Savage in it oh gosh oh no no no no no did you see that movie with Fred Savage in it though with uh i don't think so oh he had uh uh oh it was The Princess Bride nope i didn't see that you didn't see that that was cute that was real that was a good one i i like i like slapstick comedy so do i and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and and you're not sure how whether it'll be any good or not so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than yeah well i heard a friend of mine told me she got Naked Gun last night and she said that was hilarious that yeah now we saw that and i and they're coming out with a sequel to it two and a half it was funny it was yeah i want to see that she said she rented it last night and said it was real good and and and Working Girl is really good now i seen that that was good was that with that blonde she pretended to be the boss or something yeah i rented that one night by myself i was home alone did you see Home Alone yeah yes i did that that that just reminded me of that did you like it i no i haven't seen it yet see we got TV  okay well what are your hobbies oh they range from from needlepoint to uh anything in the hobby field as far as um needlework is concerned i've had to give it up recently because um i've got problems with uh nerves in my right hand but basically it's anything in that hobby line i'll try anything including making uh earrings hum that sounds interesting i have no love of yard work for hobby work though how about you well uh my i've got some fairly bizarre but uh i do a lot of flying aerobatics for one oh fantastic which a lot of people don't do and uh woodworking i do i do enjoy doing landscaping some landscaping type stuff i build i like i enjoy working with wood and stuff like that building decks gazebos those types of things oh so but uh probably if i had to say my most favorite one was probably be uh flying i've been in a uh glider which as a student piot pilot i loved it immensely did you oh you actually tried it before as a student pilot yeah as a student pilot how long did you do it uh i was only in one one trip it was something i would have liked to have kept up but we moved out of Colorado so that was you know that ended that point but yeah that i'll try as far as you could say hobby then i'll try anything that's unusual that i've never done once hum just to find out what it's like the experience oh as but that's not a constant hobby you know like i'll do uh oh i'll pick up normally a petit point or anything in stitchery type of line and if i'm really bored i'll even pick up something and color it but i do a lot of designing also hum well needlepoint looks pretty i i think you know if it's done real nice real you know if it's done right it looks really good well i've done a petit point which is really extremely hard and uh that was very difficult for me it took me oh i think that almost took me a year and a half to finish that hum and petit point is like if you've seen regular needlepoint it's one half of that in the stitches and it goes down like real small little tiny it's exactly what it says petit point boy that's tedious yes it was tedious i dropped it as i said it took me about a year and a half because it's not something i could continuously do but now i'm into more uh taking something that i like and trying to actually put it onto paper myself hum which i find more enjoyment that's got a lot of math to it at that point what type of scenes do you do uh this last one i'm trying to do a house there's a house here in Plano actually it's a real estate office but it has it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure it's oh i would say it every section of this real estate office is a different type of a structure it goes from almost um castle looking on one side to a very old fashioned look on the other side and it just varies in each little section of this real estate office and i think they did it because of that purpose it is a real estate office but it fascinates me the way they've done it and it's it looks good it's all done in brick the windows even vary on it and that's it really fascinates me so i've sat across the street from it and i've tried to put it down on the paper now hum i've been over to Plano quite a few times my brother lives over there and i've yet to see anything like that over there it's on um let's see fifteenth and uh Park oh okay so it's it's on the other side well i live right around here but it's not if you drive by it you don't notice it because it's all brick there's no difference in the front except you can see the little difference if you actually stop and take a look at it hum that's why it fascinates me but uh again you know i'd like to be able to go ahead and take that someday and actually make a house of my own well that's pretty neat though i would i mean i wish i had that that much patience to sit down and do something tedious like that but after a while it would just drive me nuts well see you're doing the same thing when you're doing your gazebo you're playing with numbers that's all this is you putting it on paper so you're just playing with numbers yeah it's like i would love to play with work but i don't have the strength in my hands hum anymore to do anything like that but i've put up uh like um a wall board fixed a bedroom and put in a bath i like things i like i like building furniture probably the best that that sort of thing when i had the equipment and and the place to set it up i like things that are difficult to do i like to see if i can do it back when when i was in college i took lots of wood courses and then i i even did it after i was out of college i continued to do it and i built just about every stick of furniture in my house everything from dining furniture to armoire to the whole nine yards takes a long long time to do all that stuff yeah i have a small miter box uh for hobby mitering um-hum and it does the same thing what you're saying but i'd like to which i've been trying to find to go into as far as a permanent hobby which because i'm having difficulties with this is to go into uh i'm sure you've seen it is those wood uh oh they're they're wood pictures on the wall but if one move if one part moves it counterparts the other parts and so like it's a continuous counterpart around it and it's all made out of wood hum and i have as i said i have a miniature uh miter box which is made for hobby works and i've had that for quite a few years now but i haven't really gone into that part i've been thinking about making um oh ladders and everything for my uh pocket parrot because they're hard to find toys for a pocket parrot they make them for parrots and they make them for cockatiels and a pocket parrot's between the two um-hum and so i need rings that are exactly between those two sizes so i'm going to i've got some designs for i go into the pet stores but you can say again another hobby i've got is my birds so birds hum birds i have a cockatiel and a pocket parrot oh those are interesting but um other than that see which ones talk do do the do they talk uh Sam uh cockatiel talks he whistles at me and says good morning uh he picked up most of his sayings from the other cockatiel i had the pocket parrot is a very quiet bird it's an extremely tame bird it's uh if you're real gentle with it when you buy it it'll come out and sit on your shoulder with no problem hum yeah they're a very very tender bird about the only thing i had when i was growing up was probably a parakeet and canary and uh we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit and uh oh you they wouldn't really you know didn't really want you to pick them up per se but you know when i did they didn't they didn't give me a lot of trouble well see when i was oh about i guess about ten years ago fifteen years ago i don't know if it's been that long i took my dog my cat and my bird into the vet at the same time and he was just sitting there he goes Carol you're the only one i know of that does this and i go what's the problem because i never thought about it i had never thought one thing at all about it and of course the dog and the cat and the bird are all out of the cage boy i bet that was interesting and uh my my bird at that time was picking the feathers out from underneath his wing and uh he finally said well you ought to get it a mate but the bird turned around and bit him he was furious he was so mad at me but yeah he had a picture of my birds sitting on top of the cage with one tail inside of a front of a cat's face and the tail of another cat walking underneath the cage so he just loved it he just absolutely adored it that's unbelievable i would never have thought that you know that they would leave you alone without trying to attack each other well the one large cat that i still have uh he took claw marks and put it down my drapes going after the birds sitting out on a bird rack that we set up outside for birds um-hum going after the birds and then he'd get down and jump back up on the table and sit next to a cage that had two cockatiels out on top of the cage i'd get so mad at that cat because i didn't realize what he was doing until i saw these big claw marks going down my drapes from his back claws yeah that nice nice expensive yeah i didn't think i didn't appreciate it too much i mean it's rather i thought it was rather funny here's a bird doing this and two birds sitting right next to him but i mean the birds were out they weren't in the cage they were out i never left them in so but i thought but i still have that cat in fact i have both cats which are my kids' cats but the birds are in here with the cats they don't care yeah huh they keep an eye on any cat that walks outside but they don't care about these cats well they get used to each other i don't know what it is i've seen guess they know they have to live together so they may as well make the best of it i've heard a lot of people that doesn't work that way i mean i've seen that dog my son's dog open up it's mouth and absolutely put it totally around the cat's head and the  well i think we pay too much in taxes how about you yeah well i think they waste what we pay excuse me i think they waste what what all the money that we pay yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax um-hum and what you find out is there's one evil's the same as the other here you don't there's no occupational tax but it's a heavy sales tax so they get you coming and going um-hum no it's even it's even higher in Dallas County so was it yeah its really i know it's just um eight and a quarter i think yeah it is i was shocked i went we bought a new washer and the man said and that's eight percent i said eight percent what so it's really kind of sad yeah um-hum and then i don't know how you know in terms of when you all do your federal but it just seems like if you're strictly middle income it seems like you get hit the worst yeah is that what you think yeah because it different at some point it goes up to thirty three percent and then the people that make you know five hundred thousand dollars and and and higher than that they don't have to pay sometimes they have to pay even less taxes um-hum doesn't seem quite fair does it because they have the money to shelter things and i don't know somehow get a huh no it isn't what oh i thought you were going to say something they somehow seem to get around the the things that we can't you know that make don't make that kind of money no right i don't know i mean if they're in business and and they're making money i i could see if they're losing money but they're making money then they should pay taxes then um-hum i know and just somehow it doesn't seem you know and and they're not you mean you look at somebody like uh that country singer uh what's his name Willie Nelson um-hum i was reading about him in the paper and i said well you know he knew he was making money somebody he didn't look that stupid why didn't he pay his taxes you know right um-hum in a way it's almost like he had so much debt that uh filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it you know so right do you file federal or a joint income tax or do you i just file federal income tax every year and do you feel like you get hit by you know too much yeah i just got divorced so i'm single again so and you know it's it's it's a lot worse for single people because they pay the same amount as as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married that um-hum and we right now we don't own any property we lease so we're in the same we don't have children so we're in the same kind of it's not as bad as being single and divorced but it's sort of like if you have like X point five children and own you know um-hum you kind of get hit with you know i i mean it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage because and that sounds stupid but i mean there's actually less tax implication if i don't work full time compared to what my husband does you know um-hum right so it's kind of hard whoever works less they get a tax credit for that excuse me if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that um-hum uh-huh right yeah otherwise you're just you know and if you have kids you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something well it's two thousand now yeah for everybody oh it is oh oh my well that's not too bad um-hum then you get a you get a child care exemption but it's not enough you know i mean you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care and and they only give you like uh-huh well i think it's about five or ten percent of that you know it doesn't even it's not even oh my goodness yeah i guess that's my call i guess i better go oh okay okay well it was nice talking to you uh-huh bye-bye nice talking to you bye-bye  okay i don't think i've ever met anybody that thought they were paying too little taxes i haven't either i know i pay too much but so so i assume that we're going to agree that we all pay too much taxes right but then the question is are we getting what we pay for and and i think we don't well i i agree i agree i think we pay far too much for bureaucrats and pork barrel projects right absolutely i fortunately we don't have state income tax i know you guys do and right well i lived in Texas for a long time so i was really hit hard by the nine percent California tacked on to the government's and it's heading that way though oh gosh well i think in within the next few years we're going to have it here they're trying yeah i know Texas uh just raised their sales tax again because uh i was visiting in Houston over Christmas with my mother and uh uh i went bought a few things and i think your sales tax is higher than ours now yes i know we're just taxed uh-huh probably is i'm telling and i pay enough in i pay income tax that some people make and it really just tears me up i can't believe how much i pay but and for for what i don't know what i get for that yeah well i really do believe that there are huge quantities of money wasted on unnecessary unnecessary uh bureaucracy and on just flat stupid things i do too i do too i know there are we have we have uh hundreds of thousands of dollars going to uh people to supervise people who supervise people who supervise people and when it all comes out they don't do much supervising anyway yes you know and i know it or uh uh who cares about the sex life of a tsetse fly and why do we have to have you know well actually as a matter of fact that sort of research i think is worth spending some money on because the uh basic research really is what's made our country uh get to where it is in its ability to compete right and i don't mind spending on on defense either uh that doesn't bother me at all course i work in a defense project company so naturally i'm for it but no well i you i don't mind spending on defense for things that work but i mind having people uh uh people spend money to create five thousand pages of documentation to order something yes right right and you know those companies that that say they you know the this is crazy uh seven hundred dollar six thousand dollar toilet seat in reality it probably really does cost that because of all the paper work the government requires that you have to go through to make that toilet seat to sell it to them it probably does cost six thousand dollars yeah exactly yeah i think the six hundred dollar toilet seat is probably a legitimate expenditure given what the government requires of the manufacturer the manufacturer's probably not making very much profit on that yeah right uh no and no no but the probably five hundred dollars of that toilet seat is going to uh ridiculous kinds of of paper work and supervision uh-huh um-hum um-hum i know absolutely um are are you familiar with the Grace Commission no what is it well i don't remember exactly when when that started but it was back in the early eighties i think uh Peter Grace of WJ Grace and Company was uh appointed by i believe Reagan to um uh create a commission to investigate government purchasing and expenditures and see if there wasn't a way to save money um-hum and he came uh he and his group of course he didn't do it but he got people to do it came up with a a whole book's worth of recommendations for making the government run more like a business and he said that you know the the kinds of things the government does even in renting space would drive a business bankrupt um-hum um-hum and uh people purchase things because of the rules that require them to buy certain kinds of things in certain ways right right that are totally irrational they buy more than they need or less than they need or many times as much as they need in little quantities when they ought to be able to um yep you know deal like a business and uh get things in quantity that will uh you give them a discount um-hum right they ought to pay their bills on time one thing the government does is is stretch out the payments so that they end up paying penalties for things that the government could have paid for the minute it was due and taken the five percent uh credit for early payment right right i know that anyway there was this whole book that came out and i read some excerpts from it and every single thing they recommended was so eminently eminently sensible and and i know they just it just astonishes me that we have not put more of that into practice i know it i know it just mind boggles your mind when you think think and it's it's scary to think that these guys are up there running running our government that that approve of all this stuff and everytime right and everytime the uh Congress changes and people move offices they redecorate the whole office they spend half a million dollars on the Speaker of the House to renovate an office that had been um-hum redone less than three years earlier i know it isn't that sick isn't that that's our tax dollars and then they come up with these crazy projects to do things like spend seven hundred thousand dollars to make Lawrence Welk's birth place a shrine i mean i do not need a national park around Lawrence Welk's birth place i don't either and i can think of a whole lot better things to do with seven hundred thousand dollars i know it but you know what can you do there's really i don't even i really don't what know what we can do about it uh the ways to other than well i don't think it does much good but i write my Congressman all the time i've got a congressman who is very concerned about uh uh irrational expenses and who is a real fiscal conservative responsible um-hum um-hum that's good and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me uh-huh well t hat's good and uh i don't know that it's going to help any but if he got uh if if a lot of Congressmen get that kind of input from their constituents maybe they'll do a little something um-hum something be done maybe yeah that's a key is maybe i know i uh i yeah donate to work we have uh a thing to you can donate but of course what we're donating our uh political party that we're dono donating is whoever is is for the defense department you know of course our defense budget that's who our money our money goes to we really don't have any say so yeah well i'm in favor of spending money on a strong defense but not of wasting it and some of the things that we do uh like have i wouldn't either three different kinds of incompatible computer equipment for the three services it's just dumb yes yes that's dumb there's no reason why we shouldn't have somebody take a look at uh all of the things that the various services use and make them interchangeable absolutely i just what's wrong with that i then the same spare parts can be used in in uh Air Force planes and Navy planes maybe that's right yeah yes i know oh i can't understand but i know our company my property tax goes up all the time i'm right at DFW airport so we're we oh yeah we should be getting a tax break because we get all the town i live in gets all of the uh revenue from DFW because it's in our city limits but um-hum it doesn't all it's they're just building these great big fancy homes and uh uh taxes are just going up and up but course my property the value of my home's going up too so that doesn't hurt that's always good um well that's good but that's that's small comfort because it doesn't bring you any income until you sell it that's true you got that right now we don't have uh property taxes going up as much as you all do because we had proposition thirteen that says uh once you have had your house appraised then they can only raise the taxes you got enough's enough i believe it's two percent or maybe it's three percent a year uh until you sell and then it's reevaluated that's great oh okay well that's a good idea uh and that's that helps people on fixed incomes and older people who have houses that have gone up in value a lot but who don't want to move out of them sure yeah i keep reading where they say in in in Los Angeles area where the the property thing is just going to bust one of these days you know or and San Francisco too i think the prices prices of real estate is so high well the prices are so high i don't see how they can keep going up no i don't and they say that it's going to come you know a lot of companies are moving out of California because they can't afford people can't afford to live there to work there so they're moving i know Silicon Valley they say is just yeah well i'm in Silicon Valley and they uh the the reason that the prices have gone up so high is that there just isn't anymore land left to build on most of the oh are you oh surrounding land is all uh in preserves of one sort or other and it can't be developed so there's very little property that hasn't already been built on oh okay um-hum oh okay and one of the problems our city is having is that uh with all of the environmental requirements and the antidevelopment people taking over the city council we've driven out some corporations which were paying a lot of our taxes um-hum yeah oh okay and so now they're going to have to assess us because they we've driven out the businesses that were paying the freight yeah now that's a shame yeah for instance we have the Stamford Shopping Center which was uh paying oh i think it was about a quarter of our uh-huh uh city budget because of the sales taxes that were collected there and in this recession a lot of those businesses have had poorer receipts and so their sales taxes have dropped and we're about a million dollars below budget uh-huh primarily because of the sales tax drop off and that uh and also Hewlett Packard was uh headquartered headquartered here and so everything that they sold the sales taxes uh were paid oh okay um-hum  hi what do you do with your credit cards oh well my husband and i have gotten into some some problems with credit cards we don't handle them very well we we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more oh jeez they they're they're really bad for us um matter of fact we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a MasterCard and a Visa then and we pretty much keep those maxed out oh i was going to say that that sounds like like pretty many but i see what you meant you had them for each of the individual stores yeah we had credit i had probably twenty credit cards um-hum um-hum um for i had i had an American Express American Express Gold an Optima all the different department stores um two Visas two MasterCards oh gee i mean i had any time anybody would you know send me an application you know preapproved or whatever i went i took it and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble oh sure um because see the more the more credit cards you have the more people offer them to you um-hum um-hum um and the more you use them the more the more they send them to you but each of these had an annual fee also right exactly and the American Express was probably the worst the worst um because the with the Gold card i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up um-hum but i know the Green card was like thirty five forty five dollars a year yeah i'm forty five right i i um which was a lot because i mean you had to pay it in full every month exactly you know i that's it i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards so i sent back all of mine except the ones that were free uh-huh and um then then i also limited it to one of each one MasterCard and one one Visa and here most of the stores will accept those and actually i then got a Discover card since they pay you back um-hum yeah i had a Discover and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up um closing uh um it really wasn't my choice though i mean i ended up having i ended up actually losing my credit cards um i ended up going through a credit counseling service oh um-hum um-hum um because my husband and i just don't handle credit very well um-hum yeah and um when when you do that they automatically once you start with their service they close your accounts out oh i see so i'm still paying on all these accounts but my accounts are closed yeah yeah so and i would prefer to keep it that way once we once we're paid off um-hum um i would prefer just to have one MasterCard and one Visa and that's it yeah yeah actually i pay off my cards every month only once in my life have i not paid i think that's a really good way to handle it because that way if you if you paid off every month you never have to worry about well how much do i have to pay these guys you know this month you know this you buy what you can afford i mean if you handle it just like you would like a check or cash um-hum right and um-hum um-hum um it's a lot easier to keep it in check well and also in a sense they're giving you a loan for a month so that yeah you know if i were smarter i would have that same amount in savings and get the interest which i don't do but um-hum but yeah the the thought of adding you know X percent to to the price of what i buy i just i can't accept yeah and i and i think at this at this point in time with the economy the way it is um i think that um it's going to get even worse um-hum um i'm i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off off now um you know we started we started i mean we started this last year um-hum um-hum and we probably still have about another year to go before we're completely out of the hole um-hum but i think this they way the whole economy's is going right now it's just not good to be in debt that's right that's right yeah yeah that i would that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was you know juggling payments to different people um-hum i guess because i never experienced it and it's not because you know i'm rich or anything it's just uh a mental concept that i have yeah yeah that i just well when when it's you when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle and if you really get into the mind set i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing Peter to pay Paul and i and i it was scary because i was so good at it uh-huh uh-huh and i thought this this is not right i mean this has got to stop because eventually it'd end up catching up at and catching up with me and it hit me in the face right right um but it sounds like you know you you learned from it and you're coming out of it all right i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand um-hum um-hum um-hum and my husband's too because he's he's the same way i am um-hum i don't i don't think that well when we when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending um-hum until the bill comes in um-hum and all then all of a sudden you look at the bill and you go oh my gosh i spent this much um-hum but now the fact that you still have two cards are you do you use them more judiciously yeah we pretty much use them for for emergency type things like um transmission fell out on our car uh yeah and that paid for a new transmission um-hum um and and things like that um and we try we try not to use them for you know purchases inc idental type things like you know gas and stuff like that um-hum um-hum clothing sales sales i find are a pain yeah yeah i've i've gotten i've gotten a lot more away from from credit cards and i i pay by check a lot more now um-hum well it sounds good you know like i said it sounds like you're you've really got it under control i i admire you for for having that um uh mind set for not not even getting you know past that thirty days i i would that's ideally the where where i would like to be um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah and like i said once once it it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due and i guess i had you know not really counted on it quite at that point but um yeah i didn't like it at all i was very uncomfortable so you know and and i mean it was um-hum i can imagine i thought a lot sixty dollars interest or something for for just a couple of months and i'm going jeez that's outrageous but in in you know retrospect it wasn't all that much i mean a lot of people pay a lot more and yeah oh yeah and you know but still i mean i figured i didn't need those items if it cost me sixty dollars more to have them um-hum you think about what you can buy for sixty dollars exactly groceries for a week yeah yeah yeah i i think about all all the money that that we've spent on interest um-hum on all of our credit cards and it's just incredible but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax we've never been able to take it off our income tax i'm i'm fairly newly married i've only been married um less than two years um-hum and before that i never owned a home or anything so i never had any deductions right right so really it was always just money thrown away yeah jeez thrown away and i never really thought about it because you were good at it yeah i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um-hum um became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem yeah i suspect that you know thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and you know the amount that i know they buy i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation and you know just don't talk about it yeah most most people don't like to talk about money they feel uncomfortable i think um-hum um-hum um-hum you know because i mean i guess for a lot of people it is very personal very personal um-hum yeah and especially if you if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be yeah but i i think the the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt um-hum not not including like a mortgage i mean a mortgage is an understandable debt um-hum um because that's you have you have to have a roof over your head right and i would much rather own my own home than than be renting it like we're doing i mean we're basically you know kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away um-hum we're renting a house um-hum but but you know right now with the way our credit card situation is there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house right right but but once i suppose you you prove yourself by paying this off next year you'll be in very good shape yeah yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home um-hum um-hum but um i'm not really counting on it real soon um-hum um-hum so that's that's been an even harder lesson then if it affected yeah  if you don't cook though what do you like to eat if you go to a dinner party well uh i'm uh a bit of a seafood lover i suppose uh i have a health problem in that i my cholesterol is high um so i'm in the in the process of bringing that down so i don't eat a lot of beef or pork or almost none uh-huh so i would say most likely a dinner party would be you know would include some kind of fish seafood or you know or poultry type dish as the main course uh-huh well uh i was just thinking as i was listening to this recording go over and over till they found a party for me to talk to i could talk about a dinner party i had uh Sunday but uh right and it included some seafood so that would probably be uh appropriate for you well uh that sounds good yeah uh i had uh some people from Germany visiting and they are uh fans of American shrimp um-hum so i did a kind of a stir fry dish with shrimp that you shake up in a bag with a little parmesan cheese and flour and then uh quickly uh fry up in a little olive oil and then uh take out of the wok put some uh red strips of red pepper and green pepper in uh-huh stir that a little bit uh add some uh sliced mushrooms and then put the shrimp back in with a half a cup of white wine and just bring it to a simmer yeah yeah and then you serve it on rice and it's really a a pretty low cholesterol dish yes that sounds sounds really good uh because its done with the uh shrimp and the olive oil you don't use any kind of beef fat or um-hum right yeah no no animal fats in it right and that's And it's very popular and it looks very pretty and uh with rice and a salad you've got a a meal yeah right that that really sounds good uh i'm a a uh frequent as frequent as possible traveler to the New Orleans area and so we eat a lot of seafood my wife and i eat a lot of seafood when we go down there um oh that's a good place to get it i miss it i lived in Houston for a long time and we loved to go over to New Orleans to eat and uh yeah uh oh did you but uh we we have not been there uh since last summer but uh it's we're looking forward to going back as soon as as we can uh-huh uh but we eat eat a lot of shrimp and uh eat oyster dishes and uh we like uh things like uh the poor boy sandwiches with the fried oysters on them course i'm not supposed to eat fried oysters any more but that's uh we like that that and uh love gumbo oh yeah oh yes and uh oh i wish i had the recipe for my grandmother's gumbo she used to make the most wonderful crab meat gumbo with shrimp and all sorts of other goodies in it yeah right yeah goodies in it My job was picking the crab oh yeah so uh not my favorite part but uh but i guess uh my like i said i'm not a cook so my wife probably does or does definitely do you know all of the cooking for you know when we have a dinner party uh uh-huh i help with with what i can and uh you know we don't have uh uh something on the order of what you had uh you know it don't main dish and probably some kind of a starch and a vegetable uh-huh and uh we eat a lot of rice and and uh the the bell peppers that you uh sauteed are just right up our alley we eat a lot of that a lot of mushrooms yeah uh well the reason for using those is that it makes such a pretty colorful dish People always exclaim when you have the red and green peppers and if i'm making a whole lot uh i use a yellow pepper as well right um-hum for one pound of shrimp i use one red pepper one green pepper and oh maybe half a dozen ten mushrooms medium sized mushrooms yeah and that's plenty for four people and if they're light eaters you can squeeze in six yeah yeah yeah if you if you wanted to uh put a little crunchiness in that uh throw a few cashews in it but oh yeah that's good uh my husband is a Chinese cook he doesn't do much cooking either but he loves to cook Chinese and he has a marvelous uh chicken with cashews and yeah but uh right and uh right the cashew chicken is is i i really enjoy that and the Szechuan peppers now those are not the hot ones those are the little round pink ones oh yeah just right and oh they are wonderful that uh he does that uh uh chicken with cashews and Szechuan peppers and he also not at the same meal does a wonderful vegetable dish with Szechuan peppers but use that uses either asparagus or um right yes let's see what does he use asparagus is the one we like the best oh broccoli you can do the same dish with broccoli and also if you're really in a pinch you can do it with just celery um-hum yeah we uh we also uh uh cook on a do an occasional dish with uh some kind of a Mexican theme and it's pretty good uh-huh and uh we you know have discovered that you can make you know just as good a Mexican food with uh with chicken or with even with turkey we we do cook a lot with turkey and it you can come out with you know good spicy Mexican food uh-huh and uh and make it chicken or or turkey or something like that instead of going with the beef like when we make fajitas we can make you know chicken fajitas and and enjoy them just as well uh-huh oh i like them too i think they're great uh we i've been trying to convince the cook at uh at the place where i work uh we are kind of isolated and so we don't go out to lunch very often yeah and uh and we do have an excellent kitchen uh which is encouraging for people to stay around and uh eat and interact with one another at lunch we're a think tank uh-huh so that's one of our functions is to get people to talk to each other and she has started cooking uh much healthier food much much more uh salad without mayonnaise and uh-huh yeah uh much more main dishes without oils and uh and vegetable i mean and uh animal fats right so i think we're improving our diets i don't know whether it's the California influence or whether it's everywhere but well i think it's everywhere i i i know that uh oh probably at least half of the people that i know are on some kind of a low fat diet for one reason or another or are low fat or no fat uh-huh well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his right uh physical condition and he walks a lot and tries to get uh to stay in pretty good shape and to watch out for high cholesterol and since i prefer the kinds of foods that one eats on a moderately moderately low cholesterol diet anyway that suits me just fine yeah we have found that uh since we've stopped eating so much beef and pork that when we do eat it it tends to upset our systems um yeah yeah and uh you know it's uh my wife in particular when she uh she said you know when she eats uh some kind of a beef dish if it's the the least bit spicy along with the beef itself that she really her you know her stomach really acts up so uh-huh so we eat uh eat very little beef and uh we just yeah we don't either we just eat it once in a great while and uh it's usually if we're having company and it's somebody that we know is a big meat fan but there're fewer and fewer of those uh-huh right yeah uh-huh so we also do an awful lot of cooking when it's just the two of us on a little tiny uh grill it's uh-huh oh it's less than a foot long and about eight inches wide and we just put a few charcoals in there and uh we can cook a piece of chicken we buy boneless chicken breasts and save us ourselves a lot of time um-hum And that with uh do have you ever tried Lawrey's Lemon Pepper oh you can buy it in the grocery store yeah i i don't know whether we've tried that or not i i know we've got a we've got a uh is that uh the salt it's a well it has sea salt in it yes i think we've got a but it's not the same as they have the Lawrey's seasoned salt and the Lawrey's seasoning Lemon Pepper and the Lemon Pepper's the one i love on chicken and fish uh-huh yeah and uh yeah just barely brush it with oil grill it uh so it's not too done and sprinkle a little of that on it and then i add some lemon thyme from my garden um-hum and that makes an excellent and very easy to fix dinner yeah you know it's uh about fifteen minutes until noon here and we're talking about food and i'm well i hope you have a nice lunch yeah it's been a it's this is a this is a good timely conversation you know got my appetite going i'm just looking at our menu unfortunately we're having a terrible lunch here today for the cholesterol people because uh we're going to have Italian sausage and French fries i think i may stick to the salad bar today right yeah okay well it's been nice talking to you and uh or maybe we can have a good lunch and think about it while we're uh about our conversation while we're eating nice to talk to you too okay bye-bye  have you had any thoughts on this well not really uh i uh am of an age where i could have very well served in the military during the Vietnam era and i did not um-hum how old are you if i can ask huh do what how old are you i'm will be forty nine in August okay so we're about the same age right uh during that time i was in college and uh and also had some minor health problems that did keep me out of the out of the military or or help to keep me out anyway um-hum um-hum but uh i'm not opposed to military service at all yeah i think this is also a a broader scope i think uh they're talking about uh just service in general and um uh yeah i i did a lot of this sort of thing in in college in the summers um i worked uh in uh Mexico doing community service for uh for two summers while i was in college and you know it was an incredibly worthwhile experience um-hum so in theory i'm am favor of this but on the other hand i'm an economist and uh just like uh well the military has a tremendous uh you know responsibility for security and everything but there's also an equally tremendous budget so i guess on the other hand as as as as good as this idea is it's got to be paid for uh even though it's uh you know it it's it's never quite voluntary people have to be paid if they're asked to serve for a year in any capacity so uh you know uh uh the idea's great where does the money come from right i guess uh uh i've had i have had some thoughts in the past that uh this this service should not be uh performed for for areas that we don't need the service you know uh it's if it's uh and if it's voluntary service but it's being furnished by the government it should be to take the place of things that the government's doing already um-hum it should it it should or shouldn't it should um-hum should right so uh you know the the the voluntary service in the medical you know but i don't think it was it was voluntary i think it was just the required year of required service there was nothing about voluntary oh okay yeah then then then i guess that's you know uh-huh that's why as an economist my my my ears perked up uh at at any rate i guess my idea is that that if we're going to replace if we're going to to institute this national service policy that that service policy should replace some other area um-hum uh-huh where we're spending money uh you know uh you know eliminate eliminate some bureaucrats and let the let these national this national service take care of their job and doing it at a less expensive rate then uh-huh of course you'll probably get another whole layer of bureaucracy running it right and uh i mean let's face it the military is probably one of the most bureaucratic agencies right yeah so i i i you know on the one hand my immediate reaction to it was oh it's wonderful you know i think people do owe their country something whether it yeah they serve in the military or for those who for for one reason or other can't want to serve in another area and have talents in another area um-hum great but then who pays and if they have to and they don't go into the labor the other labor force you're losing money in terms of taxing yeah right from other jobs i mean so there's it's not it's not a real cut and dry yeah i agree uh it and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh thing um-hum have the the military which is you know is is is a a a real drain financially on the country have the people that are in the military serve some other function you know instead instead of just military uh um-hum um-hum um-hum and just marching around waiting for a war right uh yeah uh we did have something similar to a volunteer thing with uh which was volunteer although volunteer there was a minimum payment uh like Vista which was a domestic Peace Corps some time back right and probably coming from Texas you may have bumped into some of that yeah i have seen uh you know i'm not really that you know that familiar with it i am aware that that that Vista and uh yeah oh yeah and i know the army what's the army has a corps of engineers um-hum which uh could probably be one of those areas that uh could be uh privatized or civilianized or whatever some of the areas there you know for domestic use right i've always wondered why the army corps of of engineers took care of floods you know in in certain areas why was right it's well i guess uh in in in looking at that one reason that the army corps of engineers is that uh the military schools um-hum do have probably among the top engineering schools in the country uh um-hum but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb right but uh but if if the government's going to uh to provide the service then government you know government trained people are are logical to do that uh yeah they made um-hum yeah and of course back during the depression when the government started doing things like uh CCC the Civilian Conservation Corps um-hum so i uh you know there's a bit of a history of people serving the government and it doesn't have to be as the military you know if you go in just as a as an enlistee uh the wage isn't anything great right so if if you're asking for a year of service it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the uh if it's a required year it doesn't have to be a wage comparable to the private sector so it could be you know a wage enough to for have someone to live on to eat and if uh if in fact right right yeah so i guess that it a lot of thinking would have to be done if it were implemented well and it right it yeah uh yeah i guess uh basically i'm you know i'm in favor of uh of the idea but um-hum i think that uh like you said a lot of thought needs to go into it just uh the financing and and the the uh the yeah how it's administered and how you know uh just the who uh who who would be exempted because i'm sure there would be exemptions to it but uh but uh you know medical service and uh uh aid aid you know or or assistance for families and uh uh um-hum oh even uh even uh running the uh the prison system might be a you know a a an area that could run could taken be taken care of um-hum or even or even doing paperwork for a police systems you know right uh there's any number of things that the government's involved in that uh um-hum yeah that this service could take care of homeless homeless and all yeah i think they're going to cut us off well i think that's my call waiting line ringing whoever that is will probably call back oh oh yeah but i think you know in terms of the the the crime pressing problems in the United States today that in terms of the homeless in terms of the state of the the state of the prisons um-hum um there're there're probably a lot of things that could be done uh on a volunteer basis so maybe they should do pilot projects to try it out to see how it works right yeah right and uh just to see what uh what all could be done yeah it's uh nice talking to you too okay bye-bye yeah well listen it was good talking with you okay bye-bye  okay Ray what do you think about taxes okay um too high obviously um-hum yeah i agree but my property taxes have been going up repeatedly uh over the last uh well this is going to be the seventh year in a row that they've increased oh really so um and they're always saying if you know if they don't raise taxes then they're going to have to lay off on uh the teachers they're going to have to lay of uh firemen they're going to have to lay off the police officers hum-um but yet they don't talk anything about the administration about cutting back on that end of it um-hum they just they've they're in the middle of an expose now on the state and the City of Providence uh public works departments uh-huh yeah and they've had TV cameras going around uh they wait at some of the yards and they follow the trucks as they come out uh at random yeah just to see what they do during the course of the day uh-huh and there's not much that's going on i'll tell you i mean they're going to gin mills and and spending half a day in there drinking or they're going to other people's homes and doing work oh so you've got you have you have a little graft and corruption huh uh i think that's in any city or town i don't think there's any that are free from graft and corruption yeah uh if they could eliminate something like that um yeah you know the waste you know that's i think uh yeah i i think that's a big problem uh uh i don't do you think you get some good services for your taxes do you have a good school district do you have um i thought we always did i grew up in a town it was it's a small town um-hum yeah it's in Rhode Island actually i live in Rhode Island i work in Massachusetts um-hum um but about uh six seven months ago they had a breakdown of all school systems and how many children actually once they once they get into the school system how many actually graduate um-hum and i was kind of shocked at the amount of dropout in our town yeah around fifty percent uh not quite but it was up there it was the forty percentile range yeah yeah that's that's pretty much i think nationwide it's you know the average is about seventy five percent uh complete school you know twenty five percent dropout rate throughout the country yeah that's for school districts i'm not sure how they figure that out if they do per pupil or if they look at just averages per school district and things like that but some schools i i don't know see i i live in a small community and um we don't pay much in taxes i don't uh this sets this is a farming community and the farmers control your property taxes basically and and in a sense you services we have uh probably what's considered the third worst maybe the fourth worst school district in uh in the in the state other than the city of Baltimore itself probably you know which is always i guess a low is a low streak so actually i think for the return on my taxes for my for my my uh state taxes that go to my school district and my services or whatever i think i get a pretty good return yeah but my employment tax you know the federal i don't think i get a good federal return at all i think locally i think property taxes on my house were twelve hundred dollars and that was that included state and local taxes so that was school district and snow plowing which isn't probably anything like that you have and that included my water and sewer um but i didn't think that was too bad um-hum yeah mine are right now they're two thousand dollars just a little over two thousand uh-huh do you own a lot of property just a or a small lot no uh a third of an acre um-hum and uh it's a colonial house that we have it's a saltbox it's uh twelve years old yeah um-hum yeah the uh plus the plus the personal property tax we get taxed on our automobiles oh do you yeah see we don't do that and then the the town also has a fire tax um-hum so we get a fire tax added to the uh everything on top of that yep and it's the bulk of it's going for the school system yeah see i i yeah but we had uh when i when i got out of school i i went up and i worked in a in a missile plant up in uh Buffalo um-hum and up there they had like all our fire departments were volunteers right yeah they had uh the best of equipment and and the best of training a and it didn't really you mean you have a full-time fire department no full-time is that what you have now though in your town yes yes we've got all full-time fire departments oh how many about how my goodness see that's see that's down here um being a member of we have we have a couple full-time firemen but basically you know they well train the guys and they run the show and they live in the firehouse and you know and then most everybody else is volunteer oh okay and then you have call yeah so there's like a core of like each station has like two or four full-time then everybody else is a volunteer yeah we got volunteer i mean uh we used to have volunteer up here yeah and now they're all paid um which is you know i don't know we can there's a lot of things that can be done because federal taxes are out of sight because of yeah oh that just federal taxes just more and more and more and less and less services you know that's it they just keep um-hum they don't cut anything right and it just feeds on itself and i don't think there's anything that anyone ca n do anymore um-hum it's just grown to such proportions yeah such it's just out of hand i agree you know the the whole idea like around here um you know after Desert Storm or whatever we have a plant here that feeds one of the military contracts that should be cut you know that they advised on cutting oh yeah but because of Desert Storm now they said well we can't cut it so they put it back in action now granted everybody around here was happy because it keeps two or three hundred people employed yeah but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes then why does Congress say tough take them anyway you know well it's like the the tanks now everyone's after the tanks they're the you know like the the Mach One is it the Mach One Abrams yeah um i don't know how much it costs let's let's round figure just say a million dollars now for a million dollars you can produce probably a thousand handheld antitank weapons right rockets um-hum and you give them to a thousand peasants you don't even have to train them right and out of one of those thousands one of them is going to hit now you take out a million dollar tank with a with a you know with a one thousand dollar antitank weapon right but they're but they're still going with the with the mechanized it's like the it's like the old days when they had the cavalry they didn't want to give up their horses to go for Jeeps or whatever they were doing then yeah and you know a million dollars do you know how many people that would feed and clothe and get off the welfare rolls and get and keep in school and you know if we uh i just right yep and in some ways i just don't you talk to them and you talk to like the big aircraft companies and all they say well if they didn't spend the money and they didn't then they're overruns and if didn't cost a hundred dollars for a hammer uh you would put a lot of people out of work um-hum but those people you put out of work you could you could rechannel their energies into making a rapid transit system in this country that's right oh i agree with you a hundred percent you know our direction has really you know solar energy uh you know there's been some recent great discoveries in solar energy surprisingly because there's there's no money invested in it that's right no um in fact in fact TI just announced some breakthroughs in solar energy yeah a big thing uh-huh yeah you know some flex a flexible solar material that it can be woven over top of something it could be it could be put on the top of airplanes to help power the plane yep yep yep you know it uh it just it could be put on the top of automobiles to it's being channeled into special action groups by special action groups and they just keep the taxes keep going right uh they just keep yeah it that just just for those just for those groups and we've got like the the uh Groton Connecticut um-hum where they make the subs yeah and we've got a division in uh in uh Quansett that does it that does the same thing so when they announced the contract up here for that latest hum-um uh sub i guess uh Newport News said they were going to sue the government because of you know blah blah this and blah blah that whatever it was but it's generating jobs up here for us but it's really it's really not if you look at the whole you know it's generating jobs for a few people um-hum if they channeled their energies if they go back to like when Roosevelt put put in the C C C camps and they built border ways for the reservoirs and you know highways and bridges and yeah um right and highways see that's a big problem we have um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and the biggest problem we have in Pennsylvania is that almost every bridge oh okay that in Pennsylvania was built during the Eisenhower administration uh within was in the City of Pittsburgh is that right and there are yeah because see they Eisenhower put through money for uh though it probably didn't affect Boston it went the uh a highway from New Jersey west was it was it funded by by special bonds or i'm not sure what it was but it was uh Eisenhower i guess thought that you should be able to move tanks across the country  what part of the country are you in uh Pennsylvania yeah oh you are East or west i'm from Pittsburgh oh are you really what part of Pittsburgh yeah um the South Hills area Beaver County well originally Beaver County uh-huh and uh where are you from uh Clarion County oh okay i know where that is i live we live out in the country yeah that's pretty out there What well yeah we have we have two children that live in Pittsburgh yeah oh okay yeah i got my brother and my whole family there i'm i'm talking to you from Dallas right now uh-huh oh oh you are do you work do you work for Texas Instruments then no my husband does and who how about you oh uh-huh no i'm just my son works for a computer a computer uh federal company you know place that that needed this well that's okay i guess it's an easy thing to do so you're you have a big do you have a rural house or what do you have so yeah uh we have a big old farmhouse that we've you know remodeled oh that's a uh-huh those are beautiful it had been you know of course a farm it's a farm community and we uh-huh yeah is it a is it a working farm or is it ours is not a working farm more more i can understand that that's probably what i would uh yeah i have a garden but you know we have a garden but we don't farm yeah i can hear the accent now i hear the i hear the Western Pennsylvania um we live uh we lived in Minneapolis for about five years we we originally lived in Dallas and we met and got married and then uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um actually married in Pittsburgh and that's that's not what they want to hear on this call uh at any rate we came back here with my husband was transferred around uh up to Minnesota and now back to Texas with T i uh-huh uh-huh um-hum and we're leasing a uh two story town home in a section of Dallas they call North Dallas oh uh-huh and it's uh near a little town called Plano well it's not little any more uh-huh uh Grapevine do you know Grapevine uh yes that's out near the airport that's about forty five miles from us yeah my brother has a home there he's trying to sell he he's living now up uh in in Maryland but uh he lived lived in Grapevine for a long time it's yeah that's why we not sure we we're not sure we want to uh buy down here because we actually we lived up north long enough to appreciate the um Minneapolis Saint Paul is very clean you know in terms of um uh-huh uh-huh and in terms of housing down here um you really have your pick but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy oh it's terrible it really is i mean we're we're in a leased town home and it's uh you're probably your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking it's nine hundred a month i oh i'm not surprised but you know what if you if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living uh right right right you know the big apartment complexes and and i just have no tolerance for that right yeah yeah it's not good no i prefer and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live that's right and uh of course most of the homes are you know fairly nice they're uh done up fairly nice uh yeah but like the town home we're in i don't know how i mean we this is it's like a duplex like a two by two they call it like in Pittsburgh and it's nice but it's i mean the girl bought it for a hundred and ten and now she can't sell it And our neighbors right uh-huh right uh-huh well prices have come down on the homes the duplexes yeah i mean we'll our neighbors the attached on the other side they're very nice thank God they paid fifty eight for it uh-huh oh my heaven that's how bad it i know well i know up in Connecticut the same thing happened and uh it's people are devastated because they paid so much for their home that's right uh-huh yeah i have some friends that live in Westport and it's really really bad i mean you but we like our area it like i said it's it's an old house and everything but uh uh-huh how far where is Clarion County in relation to actually because we're considering moving to Pennsylvania well we're about a hundred miles from Pittsburgh that's not too bad that's north north and yeah and it's it's really not you know not that far are you going up toward uh uh i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an M Bradford no that's too far north Bradford's north of us so you're you're not that far north then okay well you're really not too bad yeah no no uh-huh um was it a home that you've had for quite a few few years or that you've well we've been here since sixty six oh then you have yeah do you have a lot of land or uh we have fifty acres well pardon me we have forty we gave ten to one of our children oh my well then there you go did you have a hard time getting used to do you feel like you live in an isolated area or no not really and and towns keep creeping closer and closer you know yeah i think that that's um i can remember in Pittsburgh when this has to do with homes uh indirectly but i can remember when upper Saint Clair was out in the you know uh-huh the rural end of Washington and now it's it's a terrible connection yeah it's ours up here we have our rural connections are real bad oh well that's okay um but we but we live about ten miles from probably three or four not large towns but you know reasonable but but substantially yeah substantially you know um do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that uh yeah we're tired of doing it though we we don't want to do too much more how big is it how many square feet do you have uh oh golly i really uh we have um well how many rooms do you think yeah uh four rooms downstairs and a pantry and upstairs we have a bath a bath oh we have a half bath downstairs too we have a bath upstairs and one two uh-huh uh-huh three four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room a junk room yeah i understand we have that too that's that's large if your children aren't at home any more that's large if your kids aren't at home any more and uh pardon well it really isn't too big yet we we like a lot of people say that but um uh-huh it's we just like it real well and it's enough space for two people yeah yeah we had five children so and they've all moved you know on they're all out on their own now yeah oh okay yeah right that's okay well we've got um this this town house is pretty big it's about eighteen hundred square feet it's got three bedrooms two and a half baths um it's really nice uh-huh well it sounds like a good buy yeah it is i mean i would never buy it but leasing it is fine uh-huh um but it's just again the the privacy you know um we had a house in Minneapolis that was on three acres and my husband was raised um on a working farm near Dayton oh and that makes a big difference right near Dayton Ohio and he said you know he's he's slowly getting me to um not feel isolated if we move to to where there's more land uh-huh you really aren't isolated because it's the advantages is your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people but yet you can have your friends uh you can have them in you can go out you uh right uh-huh you have more of a choice you're not pressed upon as bad that's kind of what like his parents have uh land that they retired to um about a hundred miles out of Atlanta and in Georgia and it is too far south for me but um uh-huh uh uh-huh um but i mean they have one of the um when they said log cabin i just laughed that they retired to but they built one of these i mean it's just beautiful uh it's like a custom you know it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins you know i mean it's modern it's right right it's modern it's beautiful it's country it's you know um uh-huh more luxury uh-huh uh-huh right yeah but uh i don't what else about housing except it's uh well Pittsburgh's housing economy i i i think it's holding it's own uh they're yeah i suppose they are now we both of our children who live there have just bought a home now what part what sections are they in uh in the Mount Lebanon area yeah that's nice and uh the one the one boy the house they bought is completely livable they didn't have to do much to it great the other one is uh uh has you know needs more work done it's twenty years old i think and but they have two children too and they they bought what they could afford uh-huh uh-huh that's yeah a really good friend of mine lives in Penn Hills and they've been in their house oh probably about twelve years now and um it's it's you know they're going to start to see their return on their investment very soon um but it's a beautiful home and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh they are beautiful homes i mean my brother lives is it called Baldwin or Bebble i mean he lives all in that same area going from Mount Lebanon um it's real pretty up there it's just uh-huh uh-huh it is it's real nice and the neighborhoods are stable you know it's uh when you come to this part of the country we've been away from Dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing uh-huh oh my you would you do when you move when we first got married uh my husband works for the state and we moved once a year usually oh my goodness and then after they had to start paying to move us uh-huh that suddenly wasn't necessary any more that's what it is here yeah that's why we're at a point now we've uh we're adopting and we have been married ten plus years and what happens is uh you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get we'll be staying in so right yeah you have to stop some place yeah yeah that's kind of like where we're so we're considering Pennsylvania and we're just kind of you know toying with what exactly where we want to be you know a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house and but i disagree with that i yeah yeah uh-huh well i do too i've heard too many people say i hate it here you know they buy a place and they just hate the area uh-huh i know and it and the economy here in Dallas i mean it it's steady but it's still not going up and i um i just refuse to buy it um if i know i'm not going to be there for at least uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh five years uh you you know yeah well my brother they're having trouble selling their home they oh i'm sure yeah there i mean you can go down a street and here he told you this every other house you know if it's been foreclosed on or you know even big executives um hm right uh-huh oh yeah yeah it's really i mean a and and it's hard to sell the properties people from JC Penney's from New York came here about a couple of years ago uh-huh uh-huh and they thought they were getting a great deal um because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with they call it zero lot lines no property Jean oh uh-huh uh-huh and it would make you ill to see this yeah i mean it would probably be like your house on uh you know a half a city block in Pittsburgh or something i i couldn't handle that yeah i know and that's you know like i can look outside right now and look into the next unit you know it's across the way and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas but it's still it's still not that private uh-huh uh-huh i get tired uh sometimes mowing because we mow you know a good bit of ground around the house area and i do get tired of that but uh yeah but you have a rider i don't know i don't think i'd want to change it no and your kids have to tell you the truth um i think that if you can keep that that way you know kind of like a homestead uh-huh  okay so what kind of car do you want well i think we're we have pretty much narrowed it down to a Mazda minivan oh the new uh the uh M P V um-hum the uh the one that's the all wheel drive do you have a family yes uh that helps well we're we do it mainly because we travel we do a lot of traveling and i want to do it in comfort um-hum right now we have we have we have a four door you know sedan but it's just uh it just doesn't have quite as much room and it's not very comfortable to drive long distance in you you sound like you've been looking recently or you're buying soon well we've we've been looking for about you know two years to decide but you know with the style changes you know they're they're a lot of them are changing right now and we're trying to wait until we see what what it's going to you know the style going to stay for a while um-hum and uh supposedly the Mazda is going to change this coming year and we'll just we'll wait till the ninety twos come out that won't be much longer no so that's that's pretty much uh you know where we stand now how about how about you yeah well actually i haven't it's funny i haven't been looking at all i mean because um i'm a grad student and and my wife's got an eighty seven Olds Ferenza and i have an eighty two Bonneville which basically our our our our plan is to wait another year until i'm done with graduate school and then sell the Bonneville for whatever we can get for it and go out and buy another a a new car some place else and i think we probably i'm sort of stuck i want half of me wants some sort of little sporty thing just for the hell of it because it may be the last time i can drive one for a long time and the other half of me says be pragmatic and get some sort of um probably small economical car for a couple of years and then get something bigger like a minivan when when when we have kids and stuff or or or when we travel a lot yeah yeah you pretty much have to take advantage of the uh the wild and crazy while you can and then you got to turn into the practical yeah right that's kind of the way i've had to transition i was into you know the sportier cars and then uh when when when it comes to putting car seats and all that kind of stuff in it you know you just don't uh can't get away with it any longer yeah they don't work or then and then you got to wait until you're you know after your kids are grown and you can scale back down again yeah but uh you know right now i have a pickup truck and it's one of the supercabs and you can get you can get uh you know kids kids and everything in there the only thing is it's it's not very comfortable right well it's a it's a it's note like the i've seen that Mazda van and and it seems like it would be the right thing then yeah well they've made some changes over the you know the last couple of years since they've come out this year they're coming out with a new transmission a little bit heavier duty transmission which the Japanese are not well known for but uh right but they're supposedly getting a new uh transmission in fact i think Board Warner's the one that going to going to design it for them oh okay that'll be nice and that'll that'll help some and uh they're going to change the interior to where the backseat itself can either be removed or laid laying down into a bed whereas now it can't oh okay you can lean it back a little bit but not all the way right so we're looking at those type things also that's just yeah it's thinking ahead yeah plus you know the the uh the wheel base uh it's real good the way it is right now the all wheel drive it's a little bit higher up off the ground but they're going to raise it three more inches up and a little bit more clearance that'll give you a little extra yeah and uh you know not that i really need it for any but i like sitting up high so you can see yeah it's actually a real nice feeling i uh grew up driving the Suburban and then recently i test drove for some strange reason i test drove a Range Rover yes not because i was going to buy a forty thousand dollar Jeep mind you but just but but because um my my wife works for a temporary agency and they and and they had a job and they called me basically i basically i was shopping the agent to make sure you know he was doing good things by Range Rover you know they sent me out as a to sort of act like i wanted to buy one basically and then report back to the company as to how the salesman is doing um so i had to act like a buyer and uh that's kind of interesting yeah it's a neat little um it's it's it's it's it's sort of like being a scab i guess in a sense but uh but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a Range Rover and i realized afterward you know it's a real nice ride because it's nice you're nice and high lots of clearance and stuff like that like you said but forty seven thousand dollars is forty thousand dollars yeah that's just way too much for for a jeep in my opinion it's a little stiff yeah i agree i don't think even if i had the money to spend on it i don't think i'd buy one no i wouldn't i mean i would get if i wanted to pick out a car like that i'd go for a Bronco or or or you know Blazer or something i figure it's plus nowadays you know you it cars are high anyway you know can't hardly get anything decent for less than you know nineteen or twenty yeah and that's that's a pretty big investment even nowadays and i want something that's going to last me for at least seven eight years yeah and uh i just can't see you know these people spending these thirty five to forty five thousand dollars on BMWs and Mercedes and then trading them every year or two oh yeah this this is nothing i mean he um he was showing me they had this i was you know they had they had a beamer there that was seventy eight thousand and a Mercedes that was ninety God that's so that's silly you know and the man claimed that he sold fourteen of these Mercedes the previous year i uh i like i say i don't i think even if i had the money i wouldn't want something like that it's just not within my it's just it's impractical it was amazing yeah it totally impractical and i i can't imagine what's that much better about them that too many other good things you can do with the money besides waste it uh i just uh you know there's too many people that need things and right you know places that you can put it yeah i agree not not to waste money like that it'd be nice to think that i could afford it mind you but yeah i mean it'd be nice to be able to afford it but i i'm just not i even if i had the money i i'm i know for a fact i just wouldn't i wouldn't buy one i just can't bring myself to do that kind of stuff yeah no i wouldn't but uh we try to keep our cars on an average of eight to ten years if we can if we can get by with it we have a Volvo right now that's i t's seven years old and it's got uh about eighty five thousand miles on it and it still drives like it's brand new i was going to say a Volvo at eighty five thousand miles is still being broken in isn't it about that's about right and we we anticipate on keeping that car for hopefully another five six seven years if we can if we can make it go that long i mean yeah those aren't aren't those the ones that that have is it Volvo or Saab that has like the three hundred thousand mile club and well Volvos uh there's a lot of them that we in fact we have a mutual friend uh my my wife and i that uh they uh they just passed three hundred thousand miles on theirs and the car's probably still fine right it's still mechanically fine now you you know there's there's money to invest in it during during that three hundred thousand miles you know uh timing chains and and various other things but right all in all if you if you take it mileage uh based on what you spent over that life of the car it's wonderful relatively cheap yeah so uh you know i i so far i can't complain it's been a good car and and we're going we're like i say we'll try to keep it for a long time it's been paid off for several years the that's that's nice to have no payments yeah yeah and uh the the only other thing is you know the the pickup truck's nice but it's impractical for for traveling and family so we'll get something that we can haul stuff in if we have to and then have it for you know trips and and everything um-hum that's great you've really thought this out it sounds like i mean i'm sort of you know i sort of look around and go yeah that's a nice car that's a nice car but i haven't really well nowadays it pays to shop because you're going to have to live with it for a while you know if you if you're paying for it for three or four years right uh uh that's a long time right there in itself and then you don't want to turn around and and you know the next time you buy a car it's going to be more expensive and uh you don't want to start another payment that's going to be up around four or five hundred dollars a month to be paying for a car that's true so uh it it's it's crazy so that's that that that's real true actually but the little that eighty two Bonneville that you have that that uh that's probably a pretty good car that's that's actually it's got um it's actually it's low on mileage given that it's eighty two it's only got seventy five thousand on it and uh or seventy four or whatever you know and it's it's in uh it's a funny coincidence that my my cousin sold me the car and she's up for the weekend now so she's out babysitting in the next room sort of perfect coincidence it's a perfect time to be talking about that car um but yeah it's just it's just you know i have little problems here and there you know um stupid things start to go like the uh i can't open it it has electronic windows unfortunately electric windows and doors and the uh and the passenger window is gone you know it doesn't open any more but i'm not going to fix it because i'm going to sell it in a year yeah well you know uh things like that that go out you know if you replace them it's just so costly anyway yeah it's it's it's seventy five dollars for the motor alone and then another seventy five to install it you know so that can that that's crazy or like the air conditioning went the air conditioning sort of blowing warm air so i went down to the you know my local mechanic and for forty dollars they did an air conditioning check and they it's crazy yeah went through everything i told them to put in a shot of Freon and they said yeah it needs a shot of Freon but then he came back and he said well the reason you're losing the Freon is because you have a leak in this condenser line and when i and that's a hundred and fifty dollars to fix that and then while we're in there we have to change this this and this and you know and so it would would would would have wound up costing me close to four hundred dollars but he said look if you're selling the car in a year don't bother doing it all he said i'll give you a shot of Freon every now and then and and you're you're fine you know so well and your wife has what kind of car she has an eighty seven um Ferenza i it's an Oldsmobile yeah it's an Oldsmobile oh Ferenza yeah okay that's Pontiac okay or Olds Firenza yeah yeah no it's Olds actually olds yeah that's actually a real good car i'm finding it's uh mechanically is very sound um unfortunately the body was rust proofed by a company called Rusty Jones um-hum which i'm not sure if you've ever heard of or not but uh Rusty Jones went out of business because their rust proofing wasn't very good so now you've got some rust and now i've got some i mean the eighty two has no rust at all and the eighty seven has some pretty big rust spots on it so it's that's terrible that's one that's one bad thing about living in an area where you have to put salt on the roads so and yeah actually we're we're looking forward to getting out of here oh we're yeah in a year i'm done and then we're moving south or west or southwest  great um are you what what type of music do you like uh i like uh probably cutting edge rock would be the best way to describe it oh well then i'm sure we're going to have a lot in common i'm just joking what exactly is cutting edge rock good deal cutting edge rock oh i don't know you got your top forty rock which i just can't stand top forty music the stuff you'd see on MTV and VH One and what have you and then there's new music come from we've got a radio station down here that uh oh really um-hum started broadcasting about a year ago and they've uh they play music that you just wouldn't hear on any other radio station more like a college it's more like a college station would play um-hum um-hum which we don't have down here but uh it's just music by different groups it's you know things you wouldn't you wouldn't uh i see um-hum you wouldn't would never be exposed to is it music that um like you can understand the words to yeah most of it oh okay well the the thing that i hate really is music that um it just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of music do you know what i mean like didn't seem like it was meant what yeah kind of noise it's noise yeah it's noise it just doesn't seem like it was supposed to be played at the same time together or that someone isn't tuned or whatever but um i have to admit i do love top forty and um although i don't watch MTV i do love that type of music but i feel like it's the best music that you can sing along to and dance and well yeah yeah and um i'm an aerobics freak so i just uh i love that type of music to do aerobics to and exercise and that sort of thing do you go out to listen to music a lot do i go out to listen to music well i go to school and work so i don't get too too many opportunities to uh go out and see a a live band although occasionally um-hum don't get much time um-hum i'll go downtown they have what they call Deep Ellum down here where a lot of local bands play and i've gone down there a few times um-hum do you play any sort of instrument oh no i'm musically destitute have no talents oh don't be silly i used to play the piano and i used to play the guitar but then when i moved out you don't get to take the piano with you and uh there's no guitar around so i decided just to turn on the radio and that'll be my musical entertainment from now on right but we don't get to go i love concerts if i could i would save my money and just go to concerts but obviously not only is they don't come around Rochester too often but um standing in line for hours on end doesn't really appeal to me either yeah yeah i used to go i when i first moved to Dallas several years ago i've gone to a few concerts but it just it just gets to be more of a hassle than it's worth yeah you get a lot of thirteen and fourteen year olds and it's just a crowd of little kids yeah exactly i know and then by the time you leave you end up like sitting in your car for an hour just to get out of the parking lot yeah we usually go down and there's a tower that they have downtown you go down have a couple of drinks and wait for traffic to go away do you have a good um stadium there or or it's it's an indoor arena oh right what's it called Reunion oh Reunion no that's not what i'm thinking of wasn't there's one there's the Bronco Bowl that's out in Fort Worth though i don't know what i'm thinking of Arlington Stadium oh there's several big things down in down here most of the most of the concerts are out at uh Reunion Arena um-hum um-hum and it's it's okay the the acoustics could be better but like i say i haven't been down there to a concert since yeah jeez i don't remember who i went to see last well now you have to like the Beatles and Billy Joel you know uh i like the Beatles some Billy Joel you know back in high school i guess i was a big Billy Joel fan but um-hum i've been sort of grown out of that well you know i listen to it but i won't go buy it um-hum i've i've like i've been exposed to so many new and different bands lately just through this new radio station that um-hum i realize there's just a lot of a lot of things i've i never would have heard or even thought of looking at or listening to like who are some of those bands what are they called and oh i'm trying to think of a good example one that won't get me into too much trouble who won't get you in too much trouble um yeah be a bad example but like for example the Violent Violent Femmes they've been around for a while and they've just started playing some new music of theirs and it made me go out and buy some and listen to it i won't say i like the whole album really but uh um-hum um-hum um-hum well you know i was just reading the newspaper and um there's this big thing on Madonna's new movie Truth of Dare have you heard about that um-hum yeah i was reading an article about that yesterday and um well i haven't seen the movie but obviously it looks extremely risque and um they were just mentioning some figures that she's made like in the past year she made thirty nine million dollars and over the past couple of years it's totaled almost two hundred million dollars and i mean as much as i like top forty i don't like Madonna i don't like her and i don't like her music and um i just don't like anything about her actually the only thing i like about Madonna is i think if if i was given a ticket to see her perform i think she'd be entertaining to see perform um-hum probably yeah but i don't i don't really care for her music there's one or two songs that i like you know for a while until they overplayed them to death but uh i've never been a big Madonna fan um-hum right exactly um-hum but i do think if someone gave me a ticket it'd be a really entertaining show yeah that's true i wouldn't go stand in line or sleep overnight at the but i know oh God no but to think that she's able to make that much money yeah just think of i mean that is what our kids are growing up with right now you know that they that they were talking about how Madonna is becoming a role model for kids that's crazy and uh boy it's really scary i don't know but i guess i i still go back to the old faithfuls like James Taylor and if i could if i had my choice to sit and listen to um oh i don't know some new group of today or just uh put on a tape of i don't know Carly Simon or whatever that's probably what i would stick to although i do have uh an unending love for fifties music which you probably detest some no there's some my parents you know i used to listen to the stuff they listen to you know the Guess Who and what have you i've got some of that uh i don't i don't um-hum um-hum i won't say i make tapes to listen to in my car but occasionally i put on LCD and crank it up because i you know stuff i grew up with um-hum um-hum yeah listening to so um-hum i'm i've got pretty broad musical tastes i don't really care for gospel and i'm not a big country fan but me either other than that i'll listen to just about anything yeah do you have uh any sort of collection are you like uh you know do you go out and buy a bunch of CD's or tapes or yeah i've got some i've got i don't know about a hundred hundred and fifteen CD's i suppose do you really i just i've got a bunch of the albums but i never play them because CD's have taken over yeah exactly they really have we were talking about um how the only way to really destroy a CD is to drill a hole through it that you can microwave them and uh i don't know do whatever really it amazes yeah amazing yeah you can scratch them up pretty good they'll still play but well it was nice talking to you yes so go out and play in that sun yeah right and i'll go turn on my James Taylor tape or something all righty take care bye-bye all right okay bye  so what do you think of our trial system huh i don't really know what to think about it but i do know that they're not you know they'll give somebody twenty five years and they'll serve what eight months yeah have you noticed that yeah i have noticed that that that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um uh-huh yeah i don't i don't i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing and uh but i think trial by jury is it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh changing it such that or leaving sentencing up to the judge only i think that's actually good idea so it leaving it up to the judge well just just sentencing not the trial itself oh okay um because i think that that that that judges are probably more informed as to what is yeah well right because how serious the nature of the crime is and stuff like that and the general public doesn't know that if if if they're sentenced to life that they won't serve life of course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that so yeah right right so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there okay i must not have understood the whole thing because i didn't hear them say that but yeah oh yeah they they they give that as as an example of something that uh-huh that might happen but i think if the entire trial was left to one person i've got a four year old that you can hear but um oh yes i don't know you people too many people can take vendettas out on people right right and everything or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um right but that's true that's actually that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when you're called called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way yeah they quickly let you off jury duty i hear um right because they they know that you're biased oh yeah that that that that that's that's the way it works there um anyway i think that probably for for having it what about you know about being unanimous i mean that's sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't one person thinks that that they're not guilty and they can't decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know does it have to be unanimous i believe it does have to be unanimous actually well then they consider it a hung jury i guess i think and then they uh have a retrial or do they yeah i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something i haven't been to law school so uh-huh no me neither so i don't know much about that i just know that um i wonder because sometimes i think about it actually i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasn't guilty you know well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty it's just if they can't prove he's guilty because right uh but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and you're you're the one person saying the other thing yeah i would hate to be that person because you would be uh you know would you give in you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors yeah saying to you know just say he's guilty so we can get out of here and go home yeah yeah yeah i wonder about those things you know or even if it's you know i i guess if they were to say well it doesn't have to be unanimous what's the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide um-hum is it you know how do you decide what number of people have to say that i know it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this huh but but um i don't i just hope if i ever go to court that they all unanimous on not guilty well you've seen like these TV movies Kyle i'm talking hush but uh yeah well how they'll you know the through the whole movie you think this person's i don't know but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be trialed tried tried uh excuse me twice for the same crime yeah i've never quite understood that um well i just think it's it's weird because i've saw well of course soap operas i'm an soap opera fanatic this one guy had uh framed himself to make it where which he really did kill the person but then he okay set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then just directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldn't be tried again right and they can't do anything about it yeah because yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if if maybe you know i i i don't i don't i don't know the law on that but if they have new evidence can they can they try retry or can they you know bring you back no i don't think they can you know i saw it on LA Law too oh actually that's true i've seen the same thing on LA Law as well yeah about that woman yeah well so i wonder and then i wonder why that you know there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that you you know something like yes but yes something like well you can't be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the jury or something or you know right and i'm sure that you know it's the lawyers yeah uh after the uh defendant defending the defendant's lawyer and the prosecuting attorney i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendant's you know case in in of the defense in advance yeah well well there's also the issue of for instance you can't um you can't uh very often you can't um when someone is is on trial for something you can't bring up prior convictions right like if they're on trial uh trial for rape you can't have any you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever which right that's completely beyond me i mean that's just yeah i know if it's related they should be able to i wonder yeah yeah i mean if this man is is accused of raping someone then i think that something like sex you know the fact that he sexually sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence yeah right yeah that adds to the fact and i i i but they're not allowed to do that i i often i never understand you know having again having i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to i mean often times i wonder about rules like this and i'm sure that that that there are some reasons well that one does seem that one does seem out of it though for good because it's it well you're allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their character's you know right capable of lesser assaults like that and stuff then right then then right that that lead led to that then they should be closed yeah i mean that's what i think but i don't um but i don't quite understand tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to or vote do you vote yeah do you vote do i vote oh yeah i vote yes okay we you'll help out a little bit yeah putting the right people in the office that's a lot to do with it too a lot uh a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the um general public wants so they'll be revoted and all that oh yeah well that's that's that that's very true but then again often often times they don't as well often times they don't uh they just go you know they're you've got people like who are uh right right who are you know lame lame ducks and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead and right they sit on the fence so well oh i talked about this the other day they won't say yes and they won't say no to just certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants or the public's split on it that's true that's true i often i mean that that like you say that's another discussion but i have had that discussion before as well where you weren't i i wonder about the politics politics of it all so yeah right because most of it is politics even in the courts yeah well even in the courts you well well they're all appointed right i mean that's even another another issue you know should should should judges be appointed you know and or or um often times i look at friends we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women uh-huh now was that the um green some guy that was attacking women jogging choking oh and and choking them yeah uh his name is Arthur Shotcross no well did they have a T V movie about him i'm not sure if they had one yet but i'm sure they will um because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was he was uh he killed because he was just on trial like maybe a year ago well well how was he killing the women um he was strangling some of them were they jogging on a oh no usually they were prostitutes actually oh okay because he was he was actually this is a very sad case the man was let out he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children oh see that's what i mean then they let them out and then they're able to do it again right he he they let him out and then and then he wasn't he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to Rochester instead and they they they realized later he he'd killed about between eleven and twelve women at least i think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester and oh really way up north here huh yeah yeah way up north well uh i'm originally from Kentucky oh okay still way up north sort of um so yeah i i'm i was up north too but uh that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know if you sentence them to three life times then they probably won't get out on parole yeah won't get out exactly yeah this this this man was sentenced to i think like three life times but he was you know it was just horrible because um his his his trial was you know was it was it was televised and this and that and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity uh-huh i mean it's clear to me the man is insane and should just be locked up for life well of course but they just need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated right i mean i don't know what you do with them at that point if you're that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours and by the end i realized that maybe it would have been better if they had it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead to sort look at it you know i mean i don't think it's feasible but it would be an interesting thought if you're yeah well it's supposed to be a jury of your peers they couldn't have a a bunch of psychotics up there no or right right exactly but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists you know just sort of look at him and decide i mean there was the issue of uh-huh did they have a trial by jury for him what's that yeah they did huh well they had a regular trial by jury for him and and  okay um-hum well what do you think about gun control well i tell you i'm i'm for some really strong gun control measures but i mean that opens a lot of questions that i don't have any answers for yeah it's like i'd i'd like to see a lot of controls um on it and because i would like uh i think the purpose you know with a purpose goal and a purpose in mind of seeing violence decrease in our society but uh how to get from here to there i'm not sure i wouldn't be for against control if it made it virtually impossible for even criminals to get them yeah yeah that's the problem is when you when you you know you take it away from the people who don't intend to ever use them for for a violent crime other than hunting and things like that um-hum right and the criminals can always continue to get the guns regardless they can get them through the black market or whatever so i'm not sure if gun control in it's true sense that they're trying to implement it will ever work yeah but i i think what would happen though is that yes you would have a certain type of criminal a certain criminal element that would um um-hum be be able to find a way to get the guns but i think in a lot of domestic uh disputes and a lot of family disputes um i'm not sure that those people would be able to get a hold of the guns you know in other words a a family that has a history say of physical abuse or physical violence but isn't the kind of family that's involved in criminal activities if if there were gun controls and that there just were not guns accessible to that type of family yeah i think you know if it when it came down to these uh what i what i would consider militant type guns assault rifles and you know hand guns because i'm i'm not i'm not a real advocate of hand guns i i mean i do i do own one oh yeah yeah um-hum do you but i own it for protection i know how to use it i know when not to use it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i think for the person that's inexperienced has no business with one uh uh-huh i know well that's the thing i'm not really sure if i want to um yeah learn how to use one i'm not sure i could use one i i've thought a lot about this there was something that came up that made me think a lot about it and i i'm not sure uh somebody was saying that you'd have to you know be able to pull the trigger in the end and i guess i always thought if it was threatening my personal safety or especially like my kids you know yeah well the reason i say we were uh we personally have experienced a major crime in our family you have uh-huh and uh you know with my wife and daughter oh my goodness they were kidnapped you're kidding and you know and and it's really made me look differently i can imagine at the way it is you know and uh i'm not saying that i if i'd had a gun i could have done you know anything because i i really wasn't even there it happened while i was away but yeah yeah but i think there are certain cases where it could get you in trouble you have to be able to know when it when it can and when it can't if it came in the middle of the night where if i could get my hands on it and do something with it that's one thing uh um-hum yeah um-hum yeah but yeah that's the that is the thing see as in the past say five years i've evolved from thinking no i'm really i'm so much of pacifist that i would have to find another way to deal with the situation or deal with being victimized you know i couldn't use a gun hold on just a minute sorry we have kind of an open house and the sound really travels um that's all right well i've kind of got pros and cons about both there there there there's good things and bad things and there's there's a lot of details that you you know it's hard to work out all the details uh-huh no yeah but i but i what i started to say is i've come to the point now where i'm thinking no i really want to take a self defense course and i want to take control over um you know my own defense and my own safety i i i think i'm just i need to take responsibility more responsibility for that than i do right now i think i just i allow myself to think well it will never happen to me or it won't happen to me you know i'm not going to have to deal with that and i just i don't think that's it will i'm sure yeah yeah i assure you it it can it can and and the chances you know because we've been through a lot of the the court battles and all this other stuff over the years because they're behind bars now but yeah yeah but they won't be there long and and we we've had to deal you know we've had to deal with a lot of that and oh boy um-hum the the frightening thing is and and i can i can tell you from you know just statistics and and from even other people i've talked with your chances is one is actually one in three right now um-hum um-hum wow one out of every third person is has and i'm talking about a major crime committed against them now it's one out of every four or five for just a a crime wow right right whether it be just normal robbery or whatever holy smoke that's wild i was talking again i was talking with somebody just last week and about about crime in general i guess it's been on the news a lot lately and i guess must be in the back of everybody's mind but i was saying if people around here think if they just get a better security system and a higher fence that you know they're going to take care of themselves and i said there's it's going to come to a point it where that you can't get a fence that's high enough and a security system that's good enough well actually the a a higher fence is less is more of a security risk yeah because than a normal average six foot fence did you know that no kidding no i yeah we thought because we had an eight foot fence uh-huh the problem is they can get behind it and they can do a lot behind an eight foot fence oh that they can't do behind a that they can't do behind a normal fence that's something wow um in fact they say it's actually it's you're actually more secure if you have no fence at all yeah well i can see how that might be now i mean you don't have to answer this or not if you don't want to because i know it's a personal thing but with the crime that your family was involved in was was there were there guns involved in that but uh yes there were gosh yes yeah they well they didn't use them but they put they put the guns to their heads that is really well they don't have to use them in that case i mean they just have to have them yeah and you know they they physically were not harmed in any way they were very lucky they weren't yeah um-hum and and knowing the guy and his record his normal motif is to kill them he just he just happened not to he put them in the trunk of her car and drove them out and left them um-hum really wow is he just crazy yeah he's just basically crazy he's he's been he's been in prisons you know a couple times wow and yet he's out in a very little time he has killed people and he's and he's out one person yeah one he's one person but he's he's used them not maybe necessarily killed them but that's his normal style i mean that that's what he would do in a in a confronted situation yeah yeah yeah yeah if he could yeah uh you know he's he's been it's been proven that he that he's not uh gosh society material um-hum um-hum but yet you know like i say he'll be back out on the street just because of this this new you know uh there's no prison space yeah there's no prison space but you know you you come to the point where you have to you have to say either they're rehabilitatable or not right you got to do one or the other uh you know and those that they that they that that clinically are nuts and out of their minds um-hum or those who have committed a murder who are who will do it again because they've they've said you know when a person's murdered somebody out of cold blood the chances are they would do it again because they feel no remorse um-hum um-hum um-hum gosh they need and i and i and i hate to say this because i know it sounds awfully bad but they need to eliminate them um-hum they need to get them out of society yeah i because we can't we can't tolerate it anymore we don't we we we flat don't have the space we don't have the money yeah spend it on the ones who who do have a chance have a chance did you did you hear about that um prison reform that's going up in Washington state or Oregon or someplace up there where they're taking criminals who are repeat offenders and i mean really repeat offenders that uh have raped several times or child molesters that have molested several children over and over again and they have put them in i don't even think they call it a police a a prison but that's some kind of special it's a separate building in a separate location and they are just in there indefinitely they don't have any time when they are going to be released i i mean i've i've heard of you know similar programs but to me i mean if um-hum that and i i you know again i hate to say this but had they had they really hurt my family yeah or whatever yeah i would have stopped at nothing to ensure they were dead yeah i i understand that i and i i hate to say that but i i mean it's it's just you they they violate your family of course at that point you don't have much to lose and i hate i really hate to say that but i think that i would be that uh taken buy it no that's right that's right no i can understand i i can understand and respect that i have my own three kids and i i've i saw a story on TV one time about a father who did take revenge on um someone who had hurt his children and shot the guy and um i you know i remembered that that was years ago and i remember seeing that and and i really could understand where that was coming from yeah but the victims are the ones that are the criminals are made the criminals i mean they're the ones that that end up hurting the worst yeah yep i i've heard that and that that's really a shame but as far you know but as far as gun control goes i think that there needs there definitely needs to be some measures taken because not everybody's capable of owning of owning and and taking care of a weapon yeah and using it yeah and terrible accidents do happen when there's kids around and yeah you know it's hard to say that but on the other hand you can't rely i mean the whole time i was growing up up until last five years i always thought well the police will handle it you know they'll get it under control and i just don't feel that way well there's not enough policemen well i don't feel that's true anymore they're not going to be able to handle it no well there's not enough policeman um-hum um-hum or detectives or whatever you know and the people have to learn to to help themselves some they have by being extra careful right right uh by you know by knowing the signs of a crime of a crime beginning to happen or whatever and and frankly frankly just reporting them a lot of people don't they they choose not to get involved when in fact they really should um-hum wow that would that would be hard to understand yeah well i mean lot of people say well i don't want to get involved because then you know because then if you know if they get off then they are going to come after me uh you know there's a lot there's a lot of that well see to me i i will never stand by oh yeah but still yeah you can't yeah i i won't  well i guess um i'll start out and that is um i don't know what section of the public school system they're talking about whether it's the first eight grades the high school or colleges i have mixed views on all three of them um-hum what do you think about what do you think about the the lower grades you know K through seven well i i i should imagine the lower grades what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that uh many of the inner city and uh i guess what we'd call uh ghetto or poorer districts including rural districts um-hum don't seem to be able to produce the students that indeed indeed many uh manufacturing and other enterprises want they can't seem to they can't seem to read properly do math properly and conform to what employers want right um-hum yep i uh so that's got everybody excited high schools i'm not too sure it seems that high schools at least produce candidates uh although although i have great misgivings about the SATs that go on to a variety of colleges it seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them uh from um a myriad of nations and uh and also um uh i think that uh a certain percentage of uh the colleges produce a fairly decent uh public colleges produce a fairly decent student or fairly decent graduate um-hum yeah i i i just read some things recently where um uh colleges now uh graduate programs in general now train basically they're fifty percent foreign oh i didn't realize it was that high uh all just about fifty when you consider um when you consider uh wow especially in technical areas science engineering and computers yeah especially in those areas it's um i know it's it's almost fifty per cent foreign like forty eight percent and that involves both Canadian yeah well that's what i was going to point out i think it mostly is that technical yeah and uh uh European Middle Eastern and and Far Eastern yeah i i think um i i think i have similar views that's you know where our elementary grades um wow it it's amazing i have a friend who's an elementary who's an elementary school teacher and she said that they recently yeah you know they have to go through they have to they have to pat the kids down because they bring guns to school she teaches in the city of Baltimore and that yeah yeah that yeah that must be an inner school i just read a an amazing article i guess in this month's New this week's New Yorker about Baltimore um-hum yeah um-hum uh which uh went on to talk about i don't know i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor or or or the politicians in the in there i do i do i do know a few people and have been have done some business up in Baltimore um-hum but it seemed to me that the inner school system there was the one thing that didn't system the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well they talked about individual cases of people trying hard but it was very difficult um-hum i i i i think if i was going to fault it now if i'm i'm looking to carry on a conversation yeah that way i think there's a couple of things that really bother me i think when i learned the other day uh uh that uh the average American the average American now watches seven point two hours of television a day um-hum and that school children uh are are not far off that mark with six point eight now i don't know what school children what year that is i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube right yeah and and it's uh uh it's really you know kids can't read um it's really sad they you know by the time they my wife teaches uh middle school yeah and and they can't yeah by the time they get there they can't read they they they can't read anything well i yeah really oh so you're close to the subject and yet you know i have grandchildren i have ten uh nine grandchildren uh in various parts of the country and of course you know i can't speak to the um-hum rural or poorer inner city schools these kids go to a fairly they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well i i i mean i quiz them and i talk to them and they yeah yeah um-hum they read well they do everything well but i i i mean i think that's a that's part of the environment yeah i think it's it's probably the work that your your children your children are doing uh um yeah that that that that could be very well true she she's yeah she can tell yeah she can tell you know when they have kids come in for they meet with all of the parents and she can tell before a parent comes in normally you know give or take eighty ninety percent right yes really yeah you know what the parents are going to be like when they come in and the responses the parents will give back oh yeah no kidding oh i i i yeah i guess i could i can understand that oh i'm a product of the New York City public school system from fifty years ago uh maybe not that long ago but and um and so i i um-hum yeah always felt i didn't get a real good education in the public in the grammar schools and part of high school um-hum so i lived in New England at the time i sent all my children to prep school i was i well i didn't have that much money but we struggled and we did it and i thought it right i thought a great deal of it was a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio i think i think it's probably very true and i i i think that could that's a formula that could be applied everywhere except it must cost a heck of a lot of money if you do it in public school um-hum um-hum but you know surprisingly i i because you put such a commitment on education um your children probably could have gone to schools with uh uh a higher yeah student teacher ratio and still done well because when they would come home you and your wife would say you know what did you do today if we let's sit down and read together yeah um-hum yeah yeah yeah well that that that's that that must be then then if that's uh i think we both agree on that then then then then a parent parental involvement has to be there and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also another thing that i have another yeah oh it's parental yep um-hum yeah problem i have is uh i don't really know how to resolve this but is the incredible at least in the high school and college level emphasis on sports where enormous amounts of money are spent and it seems to me that money money could be more well well spent somewhere else but you know you know what's really funny is that they there's been some research because i'm a i'm a college professor and um uh and and yeah oh yeah well a lot of the research shows that like Georgetown while Ewing was playing at Georgetown basketball Georgetown yeah right right right right and they were winning yeah endowment to the university in other words money that could to everything everything and normally gets directed away from sports realistically a lot of the was uh was probably two thirds i guess it's now two thirds of what it was when they were national champions in other words while they're national champions people donate more money yeah yeah right average human beings like you and i average Joes that make a decent salary that are a graduate of the school send big bucks like couple hundreds of dollars but thousands of people right but i mean it right to to what uh to sports you say other things than sports though because no because normally it's because of the sports yeah i know but i mean they don't just send it to the new stadium or right right but see the sports brings in the money really i well i guess they're because when Georgetown was number one their their their money money that was donated to them from companies from from local from business people from graduates whatever was up into you know like twenty million dollars and now it's down to like fourteen million right right right yeah during that time period in other other words well i never thought of that benefit their income has slowly their their alumni alumni giving and other funds have slowly dropped since then yeah well i i never thought of that benefit but the consequence then i my i guess what i'd have to say about that is there can only be one champion um-hum yeah yeah that's yeah it's it's amazing the way but now that's big time yeah but but uh smaller schools aren't like that uh only only the big time schools show that but you're right i i think the emphasis on sports and as a see i'm a i'm a i'm a former athlete in a sense i swam isn't that something though i didn't realize that no yeah yeah yeah but swimming never gets much glory so it really doesn't matter but well Mark Spitz made a lot of money out of it and he didn't and he came back this year didn't he but he didn't make it ah that's true that's true but you know they still he didn't make it no i i would have liked it if he if he would have though but i think uh realistically you know you read the the research studies and uh i don't think he would have made it simply because yeah yeah the well the event he was trying to swim they even the research shows that distance running yeah so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um well the the distance strength and endurance or whatever sort of starts to peak at about twenty eight twenty nine thirty that's why some of your long distance runners were in their late early thirties right right and but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event and most of them are under twenty five right well i read i i also read i we're getting off the subject here a bit but i i do want to add this to that because i i was quite interested in that myself but i read where the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay um-hum yeah uh-huh for the long distance events and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors if you brought just the finish here he comes down the finish line right oh you're kidding so it had to be it had to be where they could put it in one segment and get and and i guess capture the whole thing for some sponsor jeez and that's let me ask you another question as as an athlete i just hate that go head yeah what were saying what were you saying yeah well if if you teach college uh college and and i know when i went to college i i went to summer school and i thought that uh in fact that uh my my idea of it was uh rather than yeah um-hum rather than finish early i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking and i had the ability to to go in summer school and i i didn't take those subjects so what that leads me my next thought is i understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway compared to the Japanese or the Germans um-hum um-hum right yeah i think i think well how do you think that would work in grammar schools and i think uh in in some sense um what i would do before i would extend a school year is i would make it better before i would continue the agony yeah yeah that's right yeah and something you have to consider too um because i know as as a as a as a former high school teacher i know that from right now  well i'm talking to you from Dallas what part of the country are you in oh boy this is gonna be tough i'm in Plano well we can uh complain together or we'll swear we can complain together about the humidity exactly i guess the weather hasn't been too different between us no i don't think so i wouldn't think yeah i north far north Dallas yeah about a half a mile from Plano so we're in the what what part of Dallas are you from oh north Dallas well jeez well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also yeah it's very very rainy i know oh how about that how does it compare to the years past um i don't know i haven't lived here let's see we moved lived out of state in Wisconsin and we just we lived here ten years ago and when we first lived here we lived we were in Garland East Richardson and um doesn't seem like it was quite as humid uh-huh oh and i don't know then we went we lived in uh Madison Wisconsin for five years um for my husband's schooling and graduate schooling and it just it's a lot cleaner up there but um it's a lot colder too so huh well what brought you guys down to Texas then uh his job he came back to start work again for a different company so said here here's a here here we are again it just seems a little more humid than it i don't ever remember how about that that's great course you know you only remember the good stuff but um i just don't remember the humidity right well this much rain and this humidity definitely i'm sure the winters are more mild here uh yeah they are actually though it was a lot rainier here in the winter uh we came back up August it's just a lot rainier than i remember it all the through the seasons you know uh-huh sure um it seems that progressively i've been down here five years just over five years now that every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy yeah and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted i really do think that's part of it huh um in in Wisconsin and Minnesota when they get winters it's um the the winters are bad but not what you hear about it's just like down here when you hear when people here think it's a hundred and six people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here a hundred and sixty hundred i'm making that up you know when it's only like ninety five uh-huh right sure um it's just like up there when you hear it's forty below it's probably really only five below right um and it's so dry that it's it's like going to Arizona well probably what you Arizona used to be like you know it's just dry and cool so it's not it's not what you think it is uh-huh true um no there've been times though when it gets so frigid that you you can't stand it where did you move here from Colorado well there you could talk about that that's that's a strange state for oh sure i i'm uh i'm very familiar my grandparents and all my relatives are from Wisconsin oh there you go okay so i'm uh quite familiar with how it is up there and if you kind of interesting uh the people down here typically don't think it gets above you know fifty degrees this is very true and it's always snow you know but uh yeah right well actually the summers up there we thought were the most beautiful time of the year oh yes um in terms of Colorado i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like um but i'd used to go on i worked for a mortgage company in Wisconsin and i did a lot of business in uh um Colorado well Denver and that's that's probably one of the stranger things when you see the air inversions um-hum and then you go into the mountains and it's snowy and cold uh it just was a very mixed bag in terms of Colorado oh sure my parents just live uh thirty miles south of Denver and it can be sunny and and no problem in Denver and they'll be having snow is that strange so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance yeah and then things like tornadoes are there tornadoes in Colorado yes or no i don't uh it's getting to be more and more of a possibility yeah it used to be no problem just because it was such a a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere but now as they start to clear more things out the mountains yeah even i mean i'm originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i can tell you that um they've even had in eastern Ohio and then western Pennsylvania they've even had i'm going to say mini tornadoes for lack of a better word and and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside um-hum that was unheard of you know twenty years ago right um so i don't know what's happening if it's you know we are the greenhouse is i don't really know yeah me neither it just you know but it's definitely not as um i know i associate the pollution with weather in general so i guess one thing we do miss is that's a smaller town and it was it was just it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere you know sure sure well it's been good talking to you good bye you too okay bye-bye  all right Robert uh my dog just went on the floor anyway um what do you do about recycling in your area well as a matter of fact uh it's it's funny that i chose this subject because uh uh the city of Raleigh about six weeks ago has just uh put in a city wide recycling uh regime in which uh bottles and newspapers are recycled and a truck comes around uh once every couple of weeks and they separate your bottles for you and your newspapers and uh and they give you little uh or actually fairly large green plastic uh containers to put out curbside and all that so i think this is a real sign of progress here in the city of Raleigh they separate everything for you they do all you have to do is you put all your glass in the bottom of this thing followed by your plastic followed by the newspapers and when they come around to pick it up they do all the separation so you only have one uh-huh place to put stuff wow so they've made it uh they've made it convenient it used to be if you wanted to recycle you had to drive to a uh a central location in the city and then do all the separation yourself and a lot of people didn't do it just because the recycling location was so unpleasant yeah because you know when you have all that amount of stuff pretty soon you have various kinds of vermin running around and right women seem to have something against having mice running across their feet when they're trying to recycle yeah that sounds like it's uh a really a what you have to do basically you have to make it as easy and convenient for people as possible and right unfortunately while the responsibility should be on the consumer it will be placed on the cities now because you know of the convenience factor i try to get as i try to save aluminum cans and uh plastic and all that and whether i get much for it or not doesn't really bother me but uh you know i live in Sherman Texas which is probably a small town of about i don't know twenty twenty five thousand and they have sites around in the community the the grocery stores are really helping out a lot um-hum they allow you they've got fenced in areas on their properties and and you go and uh drop off all your goods there but like you said you have to separate them and uh i don't know if it's really i don't think it's that bad cleanliness wise because it's there on the store's property and it's on a it's on concrete it's on you know asphalt and there's huge trash bins but there may be some unsightly creatures running around yeah i wonder what happens if somebody just misses with a bottle and it hits the asphalt i would think you'd just end up with a lot of broken glass unless you swept up everyday yeah yeah i i don't drop mine off there i take mine in to a uh a uh a big metal recycling place that takes about everything and they pay you for it so i've never taken mine to the to grocery stores and dropped off but yeah yeah but uh it it it sounds let's see you you may you said one thing that uh uh you know just for the the sake of argument here um that that i'd like to bring up and that is whether it's the function of government to do the recycling rather than the individual consumer and i guess my opinion would be that that's maybe one of the few uh-huh functions that government ought to do i can think of a lot of things that they shouldn't do that they do do uh-huh but uh it seems like recycling is something that uh that the government ought to do and that everybody ought to pay for because i think in the long run it's one of those things that's that's of universal benefit to every citizen in the country uh-huh well all i was saying was that to get it done it would have to take the the convenience and and the burden would have to be placed on someone other than the consumer because the consumer just won't do it so if if government should do it you know somebody's got to do it and if if anybody it should be the government right right right but you know ultimately it should be the responsibility of the consumer but that just won't happen it's unrealistic so uh you know in the ideal society everyone would uh buy all unrecyclable all recyclable stuff and everything would get recycled and we wouldn't have any problem but uh uh that's right not feasible so uh yeah the government should probably step in and uh take a little more charge and what's really good is um uh that the government there in Raleigh i mean they've you know they provide the bags didn't you say that they provide well they provide these big plastic uh boxes actually they're a good size box maybe uh eighteen uh inches by uh thirty inches in size and uh you know maybe fifteen inches deep yeah a good sturdy plastic box and it's got uh some uh uh bungy cord uh kind of arrangement so when you put your newspapers on the top they don't blow away in the wind if it's windy and uh uh-huh and then they they apparently built these rather uh uh fancy trucks that come around and have and have the various bins for the recyclable various colored glasses and a bin for the plastic and a place for the newspaper and they're kind of these high huh sort of uh high tech uh uh uh trash collector trucks they're big things too they must be as long as at least as long as a school bus wow and uh i'm sure it's costing the city of Raleigh money but of course i mean that comes out of the taxes and so the people are ultimately paying for it and i think that people ought to ultimately pay for the convenience of having newspapers and bottles and and plastics and all that uh-huh i wonder if uh the government there makes any money off the recycling well i think that they that they do attempt to uh that that that they they sell the the glass and the newspaper my understanding is that they don't meet expenses with it but that they offset a lot of expenses yeah one of the problems with newsprint especially is that virgin newsprint costs about twenty five or thirty percent of what recycled newsprint costs so uh-huh a newspaper company is not is not going to buy recycled newsprint when virgin newsprint is available at a third of the cost and i think one of the problems there is that uh-huh is is the cost of virgin newsprint is not being accurately accurately reflected because that cost ought to reflect the cost of recycling and hum and what the government needs to do really in a good capitalist society i mean capitalism thrives on there being a fair price for a product and and that price ought to has to include uh the cost of its disposal and it also has to include the cost of of any damage it inflicts on the environment and that's really where we as a capitalist society have gone have gone awry we have not really assigned costs appropriately for example the real cost of a barrel of oil if you take into account pollution and all of the other side effects is probably a hundred dollars a barrel uh-huh now i'm just guessing but i bet you that that's an accurate guess uh-huh hum and but we're we're paying twenty so the the cost is wrong on that thing and somewhere along the line you have to pay the piper that's what Adam Smith was saying hundreds of years ago as far as capitalism is concerned if you don't charge the right prices you're going to eventually that price is going to make itself felt but the way to make the system work is to is to put the price on the commodity and have the people who use the commodity pay that price uh-huh and the role of government in a capitalist society is to see that that happens and the way government uh does that is through taxation so with newsprint for example the government should tax virgin newsprint to the point where its uh its price is pretty much the same as recycled news print and earmark that money for the recycling of newsprint you see what i mean so that the people who use the newsprint are ultimately paying for the entire product not only for its production but for its disposal uh-huh hum hey i bet you didn't think you were going to get a lecture on it no i didn't figure i'd get a lecture but yeah i never thought of that that's you know i didn't know there was such a price difference there what about oil recycling oil well the the um of course most you know you can't recycle oil in the form of gasoline because it's destroyed uh-huh so there's not a question of recycling there but there is a question of of uh environmental damage well i was talking about like motor oil because i had read an article about ten years ago that said oh yeah it costs so much less to just clean up the motor oil that's that's used in the engine and run it through a few different processes than uh-huh you know it's it's more economical to actually do that and i was just wondering if it's just slow because it's messy or because there aren't the facilities available to recycle the oil i was wondering if you knew anything about that yeah i don't know when  you want to go first well i believe that the um the voice that uh initialized this call asked about uh if we thought that it should be something that should be put into action yeah like the government if should the government make it universal or something like that yes i i i i would be committed to that uh-huh you you would be in favor of it because oh definitely yes uh-huh uh-huh i know that there are many countries that um are very successful with the operation of the government uh providing that plan uh-huh do they have options on who they uh you know like choices of doctors and that type of thing do you um i'm not sure what how their program is run but i know it has been successful uh-huh and i would really have to uh read the history of probably i uh the country that has faired very well with it i'd like to see the uh the data on that uh-huh that's the way with me i don't know a whole lot about it i would that's the only concern i would have because i think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care and if you didn't have any choice on you know on who you go to well i yes i think that's primary is if you have a good relationship uh-huh with your doctor that you can feel free to discuss uh-huh anything with him uh-huh and uh or to change even like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service oh absolutely that the choice would be yours uh-huh um given the proper guidelines for your health uh-huh that you should be able to make um a choice there uh-huh that that's one of my main concerns i i have a friend that has their boy has been sick for several months and they just have found out what's the trouble and they have gone through uh one two three four five doctors and then a team of doctors and they finally determined what the problem was it took that long yes and the expense of that yes and that that something like that you know i thought if you couldn't change or look elsewhere you know for help if you want i don't know how that program works you know if you can do that well i would i would think that they would have that as part part of the benefit uh-huh to the health care program that you would indeed have a choice uh-huh that you could select that individual yourself uh-huh and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor and hopefully that they would have their um accreditations there too um-hum i guess that's that's primarily was one of my thoughts you know because you know how government is yes um but those guidelines have to be set up and i think they should be voted on by the public uh-huh and uh for them to have a choice on uh-huh uh-huh if they're in favor of it or not right yes and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be and it it would um i think that's primary uh for the health if they were going to have a universal health care plan um-hum uh-huh that uh they would have all the facts and the figures and uh what it would mean to each individual family and uh and individual uh-huh perhaps being single uh-huh huh um i'm not sure what else that uh we could address uh on health care um other than the fact i think um the eyes and the ears and the uh whole self should be uh uh included in all of that uh dental eye care and uh our body as a whole should be included in that because uh-huh uh uh-huh there are so many avenues that needs to be um undertaken in a program like that um i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program uh-huh i know where my son works they have uh an option right now where they can have their own physician or they can choose one that their company has elected uh-huh and that costs them less if they take the doctor that the that the company has selected and does he have an option uh if he doesn't care for the personality he get well only to the point that he could go to somebody at his own expense oh i see otherwise he would you know he has to take the physician that uh and the hospital that the company has chosen as their um you know the one they have taken and their again i mean he's gotten good service he took the less expensive one of course well if he's pleased with it i guess that's uh the bottom line uh-huh so but i i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something uh right right yeah yeah cause there's always that opposite story there uh because that's the first i've really known anybody that you know works for somebody that they had that option you know to make the choice of what kind of insurance policy they what kind of hospitalization they wanted to take uh-huh it's quite different from when i was uh under doctor's care that's for sure uh-huh i'm i'm very thankful that i'm not under any doctor's care oh if you have your health you're wealthy you really are yeah that's right yes uh we live in a rural area up here uh-huh what part of uh Pennsylvania do you live in uh are you familiar with any of the area at all well i have a brother that lives there where uh near uh Philadelphia oh well that's that's a ways away but we live in Clarion County okay uh we have a cousin that lives in Philadelphia and uh are you a native Pennsylvanian yes uh-huh okay so i'm a former Michiganian so oh uh-huh that's a nice state yes it is it's very lovely it's a very lovely state so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in you know like more populated areas uh-huh uh-huh i'm sure it is uh-huh as far as uh the doctors that are available of course we have good physicians here too we've been pretty fortunate we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields uh-huh so uh we've been pretty fortunate um-hum that has broadened so much also oh yeah that is the fields that you know are opening up are um just phenomenal they uh-huh i mean look at the AIDS uh case you know i mean they uh-huh that's a whole new field in itself it's just oh yeah in itself it's just it's an auto immune deficiency but it sure is a dilly one uh-huh it sure is i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation though yes i do too they uh they just don't seem to be i know they're making progress but not like that i would like to see yeah yeah to eradicate it entirely yeah well there's guidelines that people have to follow and if they're determined to uh have their cigarettes and the other uh uh-huh carcinogenic causing items then uh-huh how do you teach them i guess you would but a majority a lot of them don't do these things even and it doesn't seem to matter that's true too it's i i i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it so uh it real uh-huh well they say second hand smoke and that is worse than smoking so so what do you do you know yeah well you just have to ban the smoking to their to their little room that they want to yeah yeah take their rights away from them they say i never had the desire so i haven't ever had that problem as far as that goes um-hum um-hum i can't take any credit for not smoking either so well it's a bad habit that's it's hard to break it's a hard one to quit that yes it's they say that it is yeah well it was nice talking with you yes very nice talking to you too and you have a good day and well you do the same and uh we'll be talking i guess talking around the country right okay okay you bye-bye um bye bye  there a lot of places to camp in Dallas well not necessarily in Dallas but it's a very short drive to areas near here uh-huh do you do a lot of camping well i have done camping in the past uh i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was it was uh several years ago and then i did most of my camping in the mountains uh-huh well that must have been fun though well it is i enjoy hiking and camping we went Sangre de Cristos to the i have uh some land there and so it's it's handy to to station yourself there on the land and then uh-huh make trips up into the mountains for backpacking and hiking and and overnight camping well that sounds fun do you do most of yours in tents yeah we've done ours i've only been camping twice oh wow and one of them i don't really consider camping it was on the edge of the lake um and it was at a camp i don't like those camping grounds where you know you got R V beside you and then another people in tents beside you uh uh-huh i just don't care for that no i agree with you i think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where that you can't see people right out the window but right well it doesn't uh we uh four years ago it was about four years ago my little boy was three months old and the first time i left him we went overnight camping and we went and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake uh-huh and we had a ball just sat out there with our we didn't even use tents then we just had uh sleeping bags and fire going and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning oh it did it did uh-huh uh-huh doesn't that always taste so much better when you're out like that yeah oh it did it did i didn't even think about frying potatoes but my sister-in-law she's always done a lot of camping uh-huh and she's good she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out and you know that's right if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you uh-huh put your when you put your bag down well she yeah she was she is always prepared i mean she brought everything from like i said toilet paper to the rake the only thing we'd had to do we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill you know um-hum we and we and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped uh-huh and we broke the i guess it's the freezing component and we broke that out of there and put it over our um hole uh-huh oh what a clever idea i wouldn't have thought about that yeah well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time oh that's a good idea yeah we're still waiting to go again um-hum well if you get a chance now there are some really nice camping areas uh up in the Wichitas which is in Oklahoma and uh Arkansas uh-huh i can't remember the name it's it's on the Oklahoma Arkansas border uh-huh and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are but i took a drive up through there as a matter of fact last September just took the drive through to see what was there they have some wonderful camping areas there beautiful beautiful country uh-huh pretty well i love to swim so i like to get out by a lake or a uh you know somewhere close where we can swim uh-huh yeah right well Lake Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place uh-huh and we had a two bedroom mobile home there but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and build a little fire and roast their marshmallows until the mosquitoes bit and then they came in uh-huh yeah how old are your boys oh oh they're grown now oh so they don't go camping with you they go camping on their own once you start them they enjoy it all their lives oh yeah well i haven't taken my little boy yet i'm afraid to get him out he is uh-huh so fearless he it terrifies me he uh-huh oh don't be concerned there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere think so well it's the water he's not scared of he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose uh-huh uh-huh and then try to tread back uh-huh well it's easy to keep him occupied though on land i know that i took my kids we'd go out and i've them walk with me along the lakefront and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell and finding the biggest shell and uh-huh or we'd hunt pine cones or we climbed some uh pinon pines one year and gathered the cones so that we could eat the pine nuts uh-huh uh-huh and we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out we you know we we searched for dock and we ate the wild plants and we gathered wild berries and uh it's really you know the the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find yeah if you know what to look for uh-huh i had my boys build their own little camp you know three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark well that sounds so neat and uh we cooked in a pot i baked them a cake right there on a camp fire they were so impressed i used a tire chain and the bottom of a Dutch oven yes well i'm impressed my my mother-in-law and my well they've always done a lot of camping i grew up in Louisville Kentucky and there wasn't i don't know but we just didn't get out my mother and my father split up when we were young so and my mother wasn't into that and that's who i stayed with uh-huh so we didn't do much outdoors stuff except swimming and we went swimming a lot uh-huh uh-huh and uh oh excuse me my baby's getting sick uh-oh i know well if our time is up we can quit yeah um i've got to clean her up i'm sorry uh-huh okay uh-huh appreciate it i enjoyed talking thank you bye-bye you bet bye-bye  okay so my children are twenty and twenty four and uh oh my son just moved uh to Arkansas so he's married so course uh uh when when they're here when they lived here and i have a daughter whose twenty and we spend a lot of time together uh-huh uh-huh not so much as you know we're we both have everybody's busy but when my kids were younger i was a single parent and i spent most of my life with my children i did a did a lot things with the kids oh yeah but uh yeah it's uh a i don't i i i one thing that happened is when when my son uh graduated from high school and he went off to college then it it drastically changed uh before prior to that we had sit down dinners and we talked and we did a whole lot of things and then when he left uh-huh uh my daughter and i just kind of said well let's just kind of do what do our own thing and uh uh-huh you know i i think that might i don't know i don't know you know it's been so long since i had little children at home i'll i'll leave it up to you as to what's really going on these days yeah well i first of all i'd i admire you for i have a few friends who are single parents and i just don't know how people do it yeah that's is a tremendous burden to be working and have two kids to take care of uh-huh right and i don't know how you did it but um i have a six year old that's well she's in first grade and then i have a three and a half year old and um i have always been a big advocate of spending tons of time with my kids and um when i my first one when she was born i had to work part-time for a while because we had to have the extra money but when the second one came along i was fortunate enough that i i quit and i've been able to stay home and um oh so you're not working now great no no i don't work yeah and so i'm one of those few old-fashioned moms and we uh i spend the whole day with Tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know it's just it's great and i did the same thing with Taylor uh who's my first grader she's also a girl and uh i think i think i can tell a real difference um Taylor has excelled in school like i just i never imagined she would she's at the top of her class in everything even though she's almost two year younger than almost all the kids in her class hum and i really feel like that um time i spent with her i mean she probably already had a lot uh of it in her but you know we spent a whole lot of time together reading books and doing a lot of things i think it helped her to feel real good about herself and feel like she could she could do it you know yeah so it's it's been real rewarding for me anyway right but you know if uh uh i know now that i can look back and and i think about how much how much time i devoted to my children and and not necessarily but sacrificed a social life because i really did devote myself to my children basically i mean oh i'm sure uh-huh i mean i was i mean i did some things but i mean i really did but i have no regrets about that and i you know um yeah uh-huh and i can look back and it was so much fun being a kid with them and getting to do all the fun things that uh-huh uh-huh you know you get to do it that kids get to do and and that you wouldn't do by do you know with other adults right so it's great fun i really envy you yeah yeah this is a wonderful time of your life well it is you know as a matter of fact i think i'm real bad about looking ahead and thinking oh i don't ever want them to grow up and you know go away to college and all that kind of thing but at least i'm really making the most of the time while they're little and um everything Taylor even attempts to do you know we go and watch her and and support her and that was something my parents weren't able to do and i resented that because i would be in i was always in plays in high school and in all kinds of drama and they could never come and watch me and that just it was so hard for me so i made a vow that when i had kids no matter what they did i was going to be there you know um-hum and see them do it so it and like you said it's fun i really enjoy it well i can remember my my mom started working my parents well course both of them worked but my mom started working when i i was third the last the youngest and she started working when i went to first grade and i can remember uh-huh uh-huh just a couple of few times that she would stay home and i i don't know if she was sick or just wanted to take the day off or what but uh-huh come home from school and you know every like you'd tell that she'd just mopped and she had you know food was cooking and the house smelled so good uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh i tell you what i'd take i don't know if children who maybe children who have that everyday don't don't don't appreciate it as much as you know uh-huh but uh it really was really was a special and i wished that she could have been home more it would have been greater because she was yeah yeah because she worked she was always kind of high strung and you know uh-huh didn't have the time to spend with us individually so right yeah i think it's great if if uh if if you enjoy staying home with your kids while they're young and and can do it yeah yeah that's great i wish i could stay home now yeah i know well i feel i feel really thankful that i can i mean we have had to really lower our standard of living you know we have friends who have beautiful homes and we have a very small old house but i just to me that's not important because i feel like we'll have plenty of time to get us a nice house some day and i won't have these you know these little kids all my life so that's right um i just i have been willing to make the sacrifices and my husband has too and so it's not been a problem for us well and and uh so you probably have a lot of friends who have small children do you do you find the the trend is uh right away from what you're doing or that they're not spending that much time with them put them off with sitters and how about well it's interesting we're real involved with a church group and so most of our friends are uh church friends right and they're the majority of them do stay home uh almost all of my friends i can call any time of day and they're home but um the friends the friends that i've kept in contact with from you know when i did work and they're still working moms you know uh that right i feel like i real big uh difference in opinion with some of them because some of them work just because they enjoy working you know they they don't really have to work they just want to they like to get out and they don't want to be with their kids all day and and that's hard for me because to me they're giving up something so precious you know and um yeah so any time we talk get on that topic i have to be real careful because i'm afraid i'll say something to offend them but um most of my friends do stay home so that it's kind of nice we we have a big support group around here well that's great yeah it is i don't know how long everybody will be able to afford to keep doing it but if well i guess you just get used to you know living however you have to live to well i meant you know i meant if you don't ever have to go to work and you and you're you're happy you know even if your yeah uh kids all the way through high school and then it doesn't mean you have to go back to work right yeah so yeah well i intend to uh i think when they're both in school i may i have a degree to teach and um i've never used it because i was pregnant when i graduated from college and i've always had you know been home with kids or worked part-time but um i might go into like substitute teaching or something because okay the hours are at least to be home you know yeah yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that you're interested and you know the days you're not you don't have to so that way uh maybe then then you can find out if you're really happy doing that if you want to do it full time later on right yeah because i have a feeling i'm not going to like it when i did my uh student teaching i oh i hated it so that's good i said i don't know why i majored in uh elementary education and here i'm about to graduate and i don't even like this well maybe now that you've had your own children you'll like to be around little children or have a little little better tolerance yeah yeah yeah it'll probably make a whole difference and plus i didn't feel well at the time i was pregnant and i was real sick and that'd be tough yeah yeah i and you just don't feel like being around all these little kids when you are just sick to your stomach but anyway it's been nice talking to you nice talking to you and maybe i'll talk to you again okay bye-bye and uh thanks for calling bye bye  well Carol since today's subject is our homes why don't you tell me about yours okay i live in Plano in a four bedroom two bath house which is the area's dominantly three bedroom two bath so i'm just a little bit different than typical uh and of course the Plano area is basically with alleyways so everything around here is set up that way which i think is little a little bit different than most areas in the houses the way they're constructed and it's a brick house with uh some wood it's real nice i like it how about you well i i certainly hope so we have a a classic ranch up in Denton Ranch style home i should i would hate to think that anybody thought i the lot we live on is a ranch uh it's in a subdivision and one story it started out life as a three bedroom house and now has no two car garage and has uh the two extra rooms enclosed i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage are most of the houses in your area three bedroom two bath almost a hundred percent i i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision ours is probably the closest to it you know how realtors are they'll say oh this could be five bedrooms yeah if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house don't need a closet yeah me too the only thing about mine um i think there's probably about oh when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are that are identical to mine and usually they are the four bedroom um but they're spaced out oh i'd say maybe three or two block period because it's all different builders up here so it's kind of hard at that point to you know classify some of the builders but most of the builders all built three two but the one thing my house is a little bit different and i can pick it out again because it's not typical is i've got the oh what do you call it a uh double ceiling double high in one half of the house so like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings uh cathedral ceilings and uh the kitchen is norm and the bedrooms are norm so it just goes down the dining room the family room and the living room that way and i love the space it just it's uh luckily i came from a house in Colorado which had the cathedral ceilings and i just lucked out and walked into this one and of course i felt the same airy feeling which i liked it real well so it's a nice thing to move into but again it's not typical in this area you can just spot them because the ceiling the roof is so high much higher but uh well i hadn't thought about it in that sense of the high roofs we have cathedral ceilings in uh two rooms and the uh family room and in the master bedroom those are are pleasant yeah well it's like when my son goes up into the up into the furnace area over the garage he can walk and he's six foot and he says oh come on up mom i'm not going up there i'm not going up there but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room yeah so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem but um i'm not that ambitious i told maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and then get angry i'll start poking holes up there but until that time but uh i've noticed the houses around here are basically it's one story and they're all basically two uh bath two uh with three bedrooms and we're ninety i would say about oh about ninety five percent no i guess maybe probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick uh with some wood right it's basically all brick the next subdivision over from me is total brick and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine but uh the one on opposite the street now they're total brick and they're basically almost all three two they're all three two but of course they have a little river going down their area too which is kind of nice if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of better them than than us you know are you talking about a real river creek no it's a creek they've put little fountains in and such well that's nice uh i came from Mississippi recently and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains and they didn't pay any any attention to banks and oh that kind of stuff so you're just as likely to wake up and discover you're in two inches of water do you have a lot of property i mean a lot of yard around your house now in Denton uh it's a third of an acre i don't think that's a lot uh in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have yeah when you get down closer in to the newer track homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all they're built practically on top of each other that's true i know i was and an and while while there are some advantages to that there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things uh i just feel hemmed in by that it's not as comfortable a living for me um-hum well this subdivision here has got oh there's enough to put oh i'd say uh what twelve feet between each house on each side well i've got more on one side than i've got on the other but i'm like you i came down from Colorado and there was more land up there around the yard with a big full back yard which here i look out my back yard and i can see the gate i mean the fence is right there i mean just don't run too fast or you'll hit it and i'm not used to that either i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me but to me you put the swimming pool in your back yard and you've lost your back yard entirely i mean uh sure i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other but but to me their not that big enough for a pool but you know they're going up so but it's uh it's great for mowing from from that aspect you're right and and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff but yes i'm used to uh walking out the back yard and you can play catch across the back yard and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball but don't do it around here no the one that's sort of what drove me to Denton when i first came out here in eighty five i started looking and it seemed like the further i got away from Dallas center uh the more lot came with the house and and the lower the price at the same time and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city i hadn't thought about it that way so so moving up thirty five i stopped when i got to Denton it just well see now with our jobs mainly hitting downtown Dallas we couldn't go too much further but we we went that way it was the schools and the cost of houses so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic time to get into work and that's where we stopped it was the thing same problem but i think Plano is so very different you all both you all both work downtown i got laid off by TI oh well this is a wonderful thing that you that you're doing here still helping them out uh but you were working downtown oh i no i was working at the Dallas site my ex-husband was working downtown oh but i uh uh no TI as far as i'm concerned they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned so i have no problems problems but as far as the housing i would like personally i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller but prices in Plano there isn't um there isn't a section in Plano you can really move to without getting caught and uh if my price right now for what i pay  okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job um-hum um-hum um-hum we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you so do you you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that um i could if i wanted to i'd i'm not right now um-hum they but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or um i have been yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if you're not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year then you don't get the benefit then they uh adjust it accordingly yeah yeah you don't get anything at all my uh husband works for a a large oil company and they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so we've always uh uh-huh always had access to to good benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and life insurance and that kind of thing you know and right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldn't be able to do the temporary work yeah exactly i think medical is probably one of the most important things i know uh here sometime back you know they had had had given him a printout you know of uh to have money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much he'd paid and um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary wow even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and um-hum and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well i'm not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess it's there knowing that it could be used if you yeah those must be pretty good benefits i've heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his company's a little bit better so chose yeah yeah i uh we've always been dealt fairly with that way and i would certainly you know caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and how they're going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage if you knew that uh long term the you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know right yeah whatever you know the differences in the you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husband's work is do you is that the kind of medical you have uh no fortunately we still have the it's just regular traveler's insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere um-hum i guess that's good i don't know uh i can't decide well we uh we have five children so it's been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part oh yeah we're in a different one now than we used to be and it's required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so uh-huh if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you don't see them as elective really then uh you know uh you know you may not get the coverage that's you might have yeah my husband works for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before they're really ready because their insurance won't let them stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone uh-huh that's right that's right and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people aren't willing to go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is what what was paid is almost wasted yeah really and uh well i mean i guess you can't ever totally say that but you know the best good was not gleaned from the money spent where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess right yeah yeah do you uh need does your husband's company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits well yes i guess so you know uh but not uh not really you know there're there are some options in in every area whether it's medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings kind of plan that's subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so right yeah that's one thing i wish that we had was like a 401K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals um-hum yeah yeah yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh uh that that's what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so yeah you know it's good that that or retire i don't think we can plan on social security taking care of us so no i don't think so i think there're going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for hopefully we won't have such a attitude in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to lend a hand by the time we get there too yeah with what they say about how the population's changing i think attitudes'll have to change to go along with that yeah exactly so it's going to we're going to see a lot of changes in the next while and that'll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and i would think so don't you think yeah they'll need more health care i know uh my mother-in-law has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and she's seventy two so and uh it's just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything yeah but uh does that just supplement like Medicare Medicare or yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah like that so but you know i would say that overall we've been very luck and are very happy you know if if i had to yeah that's good see i my husband been self-employed and he's worked for uh like a small companies and now he's in a little bit bigger company so we've seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have you kno w um-hum yeah yeah i i work for part-time for a man who's self-employed and gosh you know he and his family he doesn't do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but uh it sure is rough for him it's providing for his family right yeah when we when he was self self-employed and we had to get our own insurance to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you could you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something oh i know it yeah but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where you'd need right need somebody to jump in and take over those payments yeah yeah it's scary yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you well it was good talking to you take care bye now you too bye  okay how's the weather been out there well the last three days it's been pretty rainy we went to the beach and uh it started uh let's see around four o'clock um-hum and uh it had thunder and lightning it was and then you know it was just overcast and rainy for uh the next two two or three days straight how about yours it's been pretty normal for this year you know uh they have tornadoes about once a week and it rains about every three days the last two years before they've had record rainfall by this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year but this time we're only um i think maybe five inches ahead of of uh normal so it's not been bad at all uh-huh you're from Virginia i'm from Texas oh from Texas uh-huh and uh i heard they had some flooding down there um they had some flooding in Houston the other day real real bad over i think it was over the weekend uh-huh hum the radar just looked nasty with a bunch of red splotches all across it uh-huh well the last couple of years we're um we're over as far as our rainfall goes before that it was really dry and uh everybody was you know talking about rationing water and doing this and doing that hum not really rationing water but just cutting down and uh it seems like uh you know the weather pattern is just shifting and uh that uh jet stream is moving uh into our area North Carolina yeah that's that's right and across but it's uh changing latitude there you um-hum so you get a lot more rain that way oh yeah um-hum brings in that cold air and mixes it with the with the warm air coming off the Atlantic Ocean uh-huh that's what it's finally cleared up it's just now still still a little overcast but the sun but the sun has finally started popping out um-hum is the temperature like sixty sixty to eighties there too or oh yeah well right now as a matter of fact i'm fixing to go play tennis it's um i'd say it's at least seventy nine eighty well about seventy eight seventy nine degrees um do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean or um actually the uh the wind normally blows let's see let me think about this south southwest um-hum yeah uh but actually but actually our i guess our weather pattern comes from the uh blows north east yeah you're right it blows north east um-hum that's the way it does here most of the time um-hum but uh sometimes it just comes straight from the north and then it and then it doesn't veer off to the east until you get down to Houston or or uh maybe mid mid Texas depends on how strong the cold fronts are uh-huh how far how far are you from Houston um well uh Richardson's a suburb of Dallas oh i see so you so you don't have you don't get anything off the Gulf uh immediately from from the ocean hardly ever unless there's a hurricane or something like that uh-huh well uh it's kind of early for for i was going to say the weather man on on uh one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather and he was afraid if it kept doing that that they'd have early hurricanes early hurricanes this year hm well we've had some you know pretty pretty rough winds oh uh Bangladesh Bangladesh boy they they caught it bad yeah kind of wiped them out but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes i know uh Hurricane Hugo you probably heard about that uh last year um-hum wiped everything out yeah and they're still uh rebuilding from that storm so the the beaches here just get really beat up uh and it usually comes this way yeah it comes up from uh Miami uh down around or you know around the Bahamas and it usually travels uh northwest um-hum and uh it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits do you do you get many tornadoes this time of year or um let's see two years ago we had one as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house and uh it was real odd the um barometric pressure drops during a tornado and our uh fire alarm went off um um-hum huh so of course that woke everybody up and we knew what was going on to uh you know go downstairs or go into the bedroom bathroom and uh take cover but uh right we get uh yeah we're we're uh we get our share of tornadoes um-hum and uh the uh uh you you aren't in the mountains or anything like that are you there's just hills there's just hills no huh-uh we're about two hours from the beach so uh um-hum you know it's uh barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains and we catch we catch some winds you know a few winds coming off of them i think but uh let's see y'all just had a tornado um-hum uh over close to Oklahoma and Texas yeah they they had a lot of them they had a a huge one that was on um Inside Edition the other night in uh the southern part of Kansas uh-huh um they took a bunch of film of it it it uh kind of chased them it was a few hundred yards away and it chased them under an underpass and it was tossing around the car right before it got there and it tore up the people inside the car oh gosh oh did it and the the camera man on the news crew held the camera out they were hiding underneath the underpass and he held the camera out as the tornado went by hum and you the the wind you know it had a mike on it and the wind and everything was incredible um boy i would have like to have heard that that could would have been something i i'm surprised they didn't they because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row and that and you know and that was way up in Kansas but over here it's a lot it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them uh-huh uh-huh i used to live in Amarillo originally so i'm yeah you can really see them well there yeah oh yeah we used to sit out uh especially in Borger we use to sit out on our back uh picnic table um-hum uh and watch them come out of the sky through the funnel clouds and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds yeah it's really strange the way it does that yeah especially the wa y it starts it starts you know just like a little swirl in the clouds and and uh then it just grows from there yep and it and and usually it's not even raining when it starts it's just yeah you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was but the clouds are just really uh uh rolling kind of just real pillowy i guess um-hum that's right and they're black and sometimes they're even green colored oh well i was in that uh big tornado went through Wichita Falls oh yeah and uh the sky i mean we were right in the middle of it when i mean signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us um-hum and a whole roof of a restaurant came off and uh it was a eerie uh a real eerie blue green color gosh yeah and the lightning was almost continuous just uh you know as if you put your hand on one of those electric uh things that causes lightning uh i think it was called the storm um-hum yeah that's it but um the sky the whole sky was full of that eerie blue green uh lightning wow and that's about that's what we get this time of year just all the way sometimes all the way through June the last especially the last two years it's rained um what i think it rained nine inches in in one one of the Junes the last two years and this year usually we usually get about five inches in May and it's it's over that so um uh-huh we haven't got that much rain but uh when it rains it's it's been down pouring um-hum all right well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer you too have fun playing tennis okay thanks bye bye-bye  well what kind of garden do you have well we've tried having let me turn the TV off we've tried having uh vegetable garden and i'm from Chicago and the way that uh bug bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago and we have tried several years in a row and we've given up between the fire ants the pill bugs the weeds the drought and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer and we just kind of uh decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden oh we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought who'd want to eat that stuff um-hum um-hum you know so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here and uh if you really water a lot you can do it but you know when you have to pay for water it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly um-hum do you have a lawn so right now we're just yeah we we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now and the trees we have a peach tree that's the extent of our um contributing to our food supply but that's nice to have but yeah yeah so what do you do up there oh yeah well um actually it we've sort of had an ideal Spring um and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks and the grass is uh this lush green and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because i don't use any poison either oh wow yeah but um you know i just keep looking at and i say jeez you know this is the first year it's been so perfect really gosh but and my garden you know my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall oh boy the plants and that sounds wonderful you know i'm going i'm going gee this can't you know we'll have a freeze if you don't have a frost you'll be all right that's what i remember from living up north is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost and half the stuff would get frostbitten and you'd have to well that's it last year i think it was you know my peonies were were budding in January and you know there was no way that was going to make it and sure enough you know we did had really mild weather until wow uh-huh i think it was May or something and then you know everything just got hit hard oh boy that's frustrating so but yeah it it's interesting and i enjoy gardening my son does the mowing of the grass oh yeah my husband does that thank goodness because i that's not a pleasure for me i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody the mowing the mowing i love gardens that are well tended and i just there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what but you could just tell that they had a love uh a love affair with their gardens with beautiful wild flowers and just i love the host of colors that just keep coming all you know year long and uh i i was in England once and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had they had a beautiful garden in it you know it could be three feet by four feet or something um-hum so i do admire that but i haven't really put uh too much energy into it course we have two little kids are two and three years old so oh they help you so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry i'll tell you oh dear oh but that's nice you know i mean the peach tree is is a start and that yeah that's really lovely i would love to have different fruit trees it's it's been wonderful to have the peaches they're just delicious and we we have we have still have to spray some but we don't have to just asphyxiate asphyxiate ourself with the poison which is good because i just i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards right what about tomatoes aren't they pretty hardy um we've tried them but again it's just like the sun scorch we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the sun i mean it's just oh see you really really have to be prepared to water constantly during the Summer people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation um-hum oh and installed that and um that's really what makes the most sense because you don't have to use so much water and um-hum it really does the job but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here and if you're not really committed to it i mean me i'm you know i'm real committed to it for about a week and then i forget about it for a week and then i go oh yeah i need to do something and by then it's burned up you know uh-huh it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives so maybe when i get older i'll find uh some joy in that well i would assume assume too i mean you've got three or four months you're talking about of yeah of bad weather yeah it just gets so hot so fast here we don't have really a Spring or a Fall and it just um um-hum immediately heats up so that's one thing i miss about living up north as i remember um you know the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather you know it was really nice um-hum we always had gardens when i was uh living in Chicago in fact my mother once tore up our entire back yard and redid it i'll never forget got my stepfather to put in uh a waterfall and a little pond in one corner i mean that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him they remodeled the entire back yard then they sold the house and got divorced so i don't know what that says about it all oh dear oh but she used to love to do stuff like that sounds like it would have been pretty yeah it really was i enjoyed it there but maybe when the boys get a little older we'll do some more planting because they like to see things grow they've done a couple of little seed projects and so i think it will be fun for them oh sure yeah yeah sure well it sounds like you you've got your hands full oh yes they're both running around now and you know gardening isn't isn't high on the list but it's not off the list yeah well it's very therapeutic i think really to get out there and dig in the dirt you know um-hum they certainly enjoy that part of it it's just trying to keep anything i planted bulbs last uh Fall on the side guard and when i went out there in the Spring and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk oh he thought what are these fun toys that mommy put out here with all these colors for me to play with we use to didn't eat them i mean i guess i could be thankful for that right maybe next year they'll do better yeah really if they survive this year oh dear oh well good luck to you nice talking to you okay well thanks it was nice talking to you too bye-bye okay bye-bye  well i've had a a little bit longer to think here because uh they waited about ten calls before they found you Bob but oh really uh i i've been thinking about the fact that the uh Gramm-Rudman Act that was eventually originally passed uh to satisfy to satisfy satisfy some of these deficiencies and place a set of handcuffs on Congress just doesn't work because now we do things outside the Gramm-Rudman with consent of Congress i guess and that doesn't seem to help us to much yeah uh i mean the savings and loan was a great example of that that's outside the Gulf War was outside so it doesn't it i guess we just don't have the resolve to to really face up and and and follow those instructions if if indeed they are politically viable yeah i believe uh i believe that's right uh i guess uh uh you know really what we've got to do is is face up to the fact that uh our economy just will not support uh all of the programs that you know that the the the some of the people and i think it's you know the minority numbers not in minorities uh you know i'm not talking racial stuff but minorities minorities in numbers uh yeah uh want to have passed uh special interest groups uh have you know their own agenda right and i think that it's time that uh Congress faces up to what i think the the people in general have faced up to is that we just cannot really support all of those things uh it seems to me that that there's there's a couple of ways that that i've listened to uh various Congress people and the President and the opposition and other people propose and and one thing that's starting to ring a little true to me is um rather severe cuts in in the defense programs since like closing bases and closing down programs etcetera simply because i i just don't believe as much as they want me to believe some of the special interests that you talk about right that uh mother Russia is that much of a threat to us any longer right i i believe that's true i mean we're seeing this thing just crumble if if anything now i see the President wants another billion two and a half billion to loan them money because he's afraid of the outright uh chaos and confusion and anarchy because there's no food over there well i yeah you know one of the things that i look at uh uh i'm in the Dallas area and uh Dick Armey is Congressman from Texas is one of the the sponsors of the yeah the uh bill that's that called for the closing of military bases yes and one of the bases that's being closed or that's on the you know on the agenda to be closed is Carswell Air Force base in Fort Worth which is right you know right close by and when they decided that that was one that needed to be closed yes yes yeah there was really a a huge cry you know from the Dallas Fort Worth area about you know yeah how it's you know that one is the one that should not be closed you know it's it's not fair you know to to Dallas Fort Worth but uh you know when Amory's exactly bill passed everybody said hey that's a great thing you know we're going to cut back on some of this unnecessary spending yeah just don't gore my ox right right and uh you know i think that's the the same case that that you know would hold true for a number of other programs uh we all talk about uh about how the the uh transfer payments you know are not handled correctly uh you know the the welfare programs and some and some of those things and you know they all need major overhauls yes that's right but they all need major overhauls until they're the ones you know until it's the one that that i sponsored or the one that my state gets the most benefit from or you know the one that that my children or my grandchildren or my mother or grandmother well you know that we've all we all all got a special interest group that uh you know that's benefiting from some of these uh oh i guess we'd almost have to i mean i don't know it just seems to me we'd almost have to change the way we do business in government if we didn't have special interest groups i mean right down to the state and city levels and so on but i was wondering about yeah you know i i was a little bit encouraged although it didn't seem to work out too well in this debacle in the Fall when they last Fall when they they they did levy a tax on some of the people richer people i mean they increased that bubble tax there i i was a little encouraged by that because that's another way to cure the deficit is by higher taxes nobody wants to pay higher taxes but i mean there's going to be a crisis one of these days that's going to force us to do it anyway right right i i i agree with that i i'm an accountant a CPA and i went to a seminar some seminars today and uh one of our opening speaker our keynote speaker this morning yeah yeah yes yes was is the president of one of the major Texas companies or fairly major anyway and one of his comments had to do with the state taxes the state yes state tax the state Texas is uh you know is in a little bit of a bind tax wise and one of the proposal is uh to uh have a new state income tax but to have it only on on corporations yeah yeah yeah and of course you know he's corporate president corporate uh CEO and uh that was just not the right thing you know the the corporations are paying too much tax already so it's you know yeah well they pass it on to us anyway i i've never i've never even thought that they that they would absorb that right so the same you know right the same you know same thing applies you know if the tax is is geared to you know or or aimed toward me then it's a bad tax if it's aimed toward you it's a good tax yeah yeah that's right of course it that that that's again that that issue just like you sited Amory's bill on the bases but i i don't know i it just seems to me um-hum that uh i mean i it it does seem to me now that twenty percent i i think i'm correct in this that twenty percent of the federal budget is is is allocated now for debt payments right yeah i believe at least that much or interest payment on the debt but uh yeah and and and i know if i had to pay that much in my out of my salary i mean it it it's it it just seems to me i don't know whether it it that's kind of a colloquium just use common sense but it it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point when the Medicare programs can't pay off when the when when they can't pay off the the the savings and loans uh uh situation when the banks can't be insured any longer when the pensions can't be insured um-hum then people are really are going to demand something to be done but it appears to me that i don't know if there is any short term or long terms steps without a greater crisis that takes place um-hum you know i i think that uh you know i think we're just going to have to as as Gerald Ford said we're going to have to bite the bullet and uh uh and yeah but how do you get people to do that though i mean i i i i i don't even find myself you know i see i i play that game with myself sometimes i know things are a little tough so i say well i'll just charge this on the credit card and i'll pay it off in a little bit and then then every once in a while i get a shock i get the credit card up to six seven thousand i say this is absolutely insane and we sort of tighten up or something comes by to pay the damn thing off but um-hum right yeah i i i i i think that we're not paying anything off i mean obviously we're not paying anything off we w e've gone from the largest creditor to the largest debtor nation in the last ten years and yeah yeah and i i guess that's the the problem or you know as i see it anyway that we as a nation are not prepared to do what we as individuals would do and that's you know we cut off our spending and cut off our charging when our when our credit gets out of hand you know yeah that's right yeah i saw some Japanese guy on television today he was talking about the the the trade deficit he said as long it's so it's so simple that that it was it was kind of it was kind of humorous he said as long as you continue to spend more than you continue to uh sell as long as you continue to buy in your country more than you continue to sell you'll have a trade deficit and until that comes under control uh the lending comes under control that that's your problem well i mean i i started to laugh at that i mean it seems so simplistic but right um-hum i guess it is the truth we just keep buying this stuff and we don't have the ability apparently to sell our products overseas um-hum and it is a very complex situation but uh i i guess but as a as an accountant do you do you find people are worried when you talk to them about what our government might do or right yeah i think uh i think not so much about what the government might do but that you know they're worried about what they're not you know what they can't seem to do uh it's you know it's it's everybody seems to agree what they can't seem yes that that that's right that we're really in you know in dire financial situation that something has to be done and the concern is that nothing is being done you know yeah i was i guess i was a little comforted by the fact that on this Gulf War uh that we have received uh at least sixty percent of the money that we asked for and i i should imagine right i don't know how that's coming you know i remember some i i just don't i haven't seen a real accounting of that yeah i have not uh have not seen that so i guess i guess uh uh if i was to take a position now and sum up because i don't want to talk too long is that the short term i guess we have to some how as you say address those issues in the long term we'd either have to we'd have to raise taxes and cut back on some of the big the transfer payments and the military an and just bite that bullet right i and i'm i believe that's right okay okay okay nice talking to you uh-huh bye okay i'm going to cut it off and uh because i've got to go nice talking to you Bob bye-bye  okay Pat can you tell me uh what actually they want what everyday occurrences are define everyday occurrences right or do you have every time you use a credit card every time you log in to a computer terminal particularly where you have access to a network to a network yeah anybody can with the right kind of skill and tools get very much involved in those things which are on your system that you don't particularly want exposed that's why we have such security measures for our corporate information yeah if you absolutely that's a point um um actually um uh using credit cards the information that the person that you give it to um-hum has of uh available to them is very limited that's to just your name i guess um you don't have to tell where you live you don't have to put your phone number down some people uh ask you for it but you're not required to give that information that's right when was the last time that you used a credit card that they didn't ask for your driver's license as well oh very very few up here yeah yeah they just don't they don't ask for a driver's license um really um well most of our checks are even printed with our address our social even our driver's license numbers are printed on there yeah see my because they require that yeah my checks are it's just my wife um-hum and my name no address um-hum so it's just names on the check so no one can you know i mean they can i suppose with a little leg work if they wanted to um-hum um-hum but the average person's not going to do that anyhow right but we're talking about people who are interested in invading your privacy people who have a reason to do that okay people who are interested in building data bases of information about your financial background your educational background um uh one of the biggest fraud scams that i've heard of recently is people who have access to such information and they find out who's a widow and what she's worth and then they present themselves to her as a uh a rich suitor oh okay that's yeah i and bilk her out of anything that she has those are i've read articles about that but people have to be pretty gullible um either that or or especially widows um um-hum um-hum um-hum there are very vulnerable people though older people are very vulnerable to such things and they tend to to old people right right and and some people some of the older people today uh their husband's handled all the finances so now they find themselves left out in the cold and they're really really not savvy as far as it comes to finances to handling their own personal affairs um-hum uh well on the other hand how can you be savvy with so much out there today there are so many clever scams and and many of them are computer based and they're based on information that's available yeah in the public realm i'm i'm still not convinced that they can get you if you're if you're aware first of all you never should give your your uh credit card numbers over the phone to anyone um-hum that's right which is which is kind of basic um-hum um they people may generate lists are if you subscribe to a magazine i guess they sell lists of names to other people but they'll send you junk mail usually um-hum um-hum that's right um-hum um and you can stop that easy enough just go to the post office and just have your name taken off um-hum did you have you registered for a conference recently uh yes i have okay did they ask for your fax number no they did not okay i registered my people for several conferences in the past six months and they'll ask for your telephone number and they'll also ask for a fax number you would think on the surface that that is for rapidly sending you confirmation of your registration or your hotel or something like that not at all those fax phone number lists are being sold in exactly the same way your street address numbers are sold and you now get solicitations brought over your fax right and you don't expect it from that source therefore you're not as uh yeah but that's uh you know you're not as leery isn't doesn't corporate have a didn't they put a stop on that uh some some cases but that it it exists is what i'm saying those avenues exist yeah right yes they do exist and if someone wants to really find out about you i suppose if they wanted to go to all that trouble they could um-hum uh i heard a story not long ago this guy saw a really attractive young woman and he said hey i'd like to know this girl more so he wrote down her license plate number and he called a friend in motor vehicles and got her address and her telephone number and then he called a friend that he had in the credit bureau and he got her financial standing yeah okay from that he also got her social security number and certain social security information is uh a matter of is it is accessible if you know somebody in the government so before it was over with he knew that she was divorced she had two children what school they went to what her average income was he knew that she'd gotten a boat in the divorce because he was able to get those public records right he knew all about her yeah you could do that if you really wanted to and he introduced yeah he introduced himself to her he said i think our kids went to school together at such and such school she i don't really remember that yeah and i mean you know he was relying on her not remembering or right yeah or not being willing to admit that she didn't remember him and just moved right in on her yeah yeah that's and you can do that anyone can do anything that's public record whether it's divorce or anything like that um whether you purchase a home that's all that's all public record sure um-hum um-hum um-hum that's right um what they do with that information people are really um go out and do it i suppose somebody does the leg work and they generate a list um-hum um uh it's uh i think lists are generated from lists now um-hum that's true i'm still getting lists from many many years ago and right or getting junk mail from a list that had to have been made years ago yeah we had uh we've got a an account at Sears Roebuck um-hum and we had moved from one town to another town and they've got our address listed now with with double towns in it and i've trie d and tried and tried to get it off but you just can't get it so um-hum since then we've gotten solicitations from other people listing both towns so i know damn well that Sears has sold their list of names out to somebody else um-hum of course but there isn't anything you can do about that no you can't stop them from selling your lists although some of them really are honorable organizations and they will say if you prefer us not to put your name on a mailing list then we will not right some of the some of the charities now will will do that if you chose choose not to have your your name um-hum um-hum put on a list and i i do that you know we have our charities that we give to and then we say yes no just don't um-hum um-hum because you do it and then you're on everybody's charity list um-hum and you have to really do some research or you do not find out who is legitimate and who is not and sometimes finding out who is legitimate and who is not is more difficult than finding out public information about people that's right that's exactly right uh most of the funds that a lot of these organizations collect um-hum um-hum go to fund the organization i mean very very absolutely little of the funds get out to do uh anything worthwhile that's right um it all started with the government the government started keeping tabs on you and whether they um-hum those list that Internal Revenue has whether they leak out to the public or not i'm really not sure maybe in some cases they have in the past uh once a list is out it's out forever oh yeah you bet you bet and with computer technology now look how spooky it is for how accessible these things are yeah but the bulk of it probably ninety seven to ninety eight percent of all those lists are going just for solicitations um some people maybe are using them for ulterior motives i'm not really sure um-hum um-hum but the bulk of them is and it's junk mail and you can you can you can get off those junk mail lists you just tell the post office um-hum um-hum um-hum so that will limit that amount of stuff sure i read uh i read and article where this this man uh sent sent to everything they could possibly get and he was getting reams and reams of paper all kinds of periodicals and magazines and letters and notifications and what he was doing with them he was storing them up and he was using them for fuel um-hum um-hum way to go neat during the winter time that's great what i do is on all the credit card solicitations um-hum if they have a return envelope with it i write across the face of it no thank you your rates are too high and i mail it back to them um-hum um-hum um-hum because now they have to pay the postage so now it's costing them something to do that yeah they don't put as many of those prepaid envelopes in there anymore they don't not as many as i've seen in the past oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card um um-hum yeah uh and i'm not sure why you know why it's so prevalent down there and maybe it will catch up up here um that's possible i really don't understand that either but my stars some of it sometimes it's very difficult now the gasoline credit cards require your license plate number as opposed to your drivers license yeah we've got the although some of them have a blank on there for it they don't generally enforce using it we've got the ones you just stick your card in the pump um i've not seen one of those yeah so whatever you whatever brand that you buy you just drive up to the pump you put your credit card in it and then it says you know please commence pumping and then when you pump then when you're through um-hum um-hum you put the nozzle back and it says do you want a receipt and if you can push yes if you want one and if you don't want one you push no  all right do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there um we've got quite a few actually what we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city uh we've actually had some warnings in uh Raleigh uh on air pollution the uh oh you mean for like smog and stuff uh-huh because of there're so many cars and we have a belt line along around Raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic hum and um you know it's it's still it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it there's a couple of uh tall buildings in Raleigh and and you can actually you know they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution uh-huh huh what do you think of that uh the greenhouse effect that's going on well i guess that's fluorocarbons the fluorocarbons and uh yeah that's causing the hole in the ozone uh-huh yeah that's very serious i mean we can we're even feeling the effects of the weather from uh uh the shift in the jet stream uh-huh it it is scary though isn't it oh yeah i mean uh the last two uh years our winters have been absolutely nothing i mean maybe one snow right well all right North Carolina that's up there by Kentucky isn't it Kentucky uh North Carolina is all the way on the east coast it's further west than Georgia it's uh right below Virginia uh-huh okay okay well Kentucky's next to Virginia i'm pretty sure well i'm from Kentucky i should know but i don't i'm sorry but Kentucky we use to have severe i mean just real cold cold winters and we'd have three and four feet of snow course here in Texas uh-huh they don't have snow they don't know what snow is they freak out when there's snow on the ground oh Amarillo well that's close to here how long have you been in Raleigh uh-huh originally i'm from Texas so i mean Amarillo so uh uh-huh yeah real close um i've been out of Texas about ten years well how old are you oh twenty uh seven i almost forgot my age oh really okay well we're the same age yeah i forget my age all the time so that's okay it's i think it's just something that goes with the territory but to me Texas see and Kentucky we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school okay hum uh-huh in Texas i'm serious if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain i i swear they close everything down i just laugh i mean i do they get i mean and traffic slows down to nothing actually they've been doing the same thing here it's you know it's kind of funny they um i guess northerners are different but even uh North Carolinians they don't know how to handle cold weather oh well no northern i'm from the north that's why i said we in Kentucky we i don't know you just get used to weather and of course the people down in south they don't they're not used to cold weather and stuff and uh um-hum it just i don't know i just laugh everytime they have a everytime they have snow on the ground everything's closed up and you know you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road that's true but uh do you all have much pollution there no not really i mean not to see it now of course there's you know TI is here Oscar Mayer uh-huh and there is a few factories but i don't see much pollution going on well you know what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe um-hum well see they have that um uh what is it a vet test or something like that they call it uh-huh and uh that's supposed to cut down on it well supposedly that's supposed to catch it but i'll tell you what and even these buses oh lord it's real bad these buses in Raleigh yeah school buses and the commercial buses yeah oh yeah i mean school buses are notorious well they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is oh yeah yeah and uh it it gets bad well you know what they've started doing is is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses they've started putting them up at the top uh-huh and that way it gets above um other cars on the road well that's a good idea and uh it really does make a difference although it it settles you know even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out it still settles and uh-huh and you know if you're going to be jogging on the side of the road that's that's even more miserable i would i'd have to go out to the country to jog well uh the you know pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway no i didn't know that because of that smoke fumes when i was pregnant with my first little boy i had read it because back then i was walking back and forth to Kentucky from well not back and forth i was walking home from uh the college i was going to in Kentucky and i was having to walk along the highway it was just one day a week but it was in uh-huh i i have no sense of smell so i couldn't smell this but it would make me sick and i'd be real tired anyway just from walking along the highway hum uh-huh golly that's but yeah it's yeah it's all the exhaust uh well that was four years ago too it's probably a lot worse now yeah that's bad oh i'm sure well they um you can really feel it you know in your breathing even normal people and if you're older um i mean you can really deplete your oxygen and it'll you know pass out and it's you know it's killed several people uh-huh do you uh smoke um actually i'm a very i just smoke one in the evening if that so i'm a very very light smoker well yeah it's kind of like it was kind of funny they were doing some uh ozone testing and uh the the EPA and they were just screening some candidates uh-huh and i don't think i'd ever you know do that but they uh asked me if i was a smoker and i didn't fit into the smoker's category and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category um it was you know i was just one of those yeah because you do smoke one a day yeah in between people so that kind of threw them off hum uh but they're doing a lot of research here uh the EPA for the air pollution for ozone and oh yeah all that they're they're real big into it they've got Research Triangle Park here and they're you know they're just doing a lot of uh lot of stuff huh but they i don't hear much about it down here course Texas we don't have a bunch of pollution but too we've got that air coming in off the coast and you know it'd blow it up north hum-um oh uh-huh uh-huh so maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here um-hum but no it'd seem like it would be the same way in on the California coastline wouldn't it oh gosh i think i would hate to live in California the smog there i mean i can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot um-hum uh-huh but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially really well well that's kind of good to know because i thought Lord i thought i lived in a halfway decent area i think they do that for most everybody it's especially it's usually for the young children and the older hum the old people uh-huh older old people well you ought to come to North Carolina it's a big change yeah it is there's no trees where i was from in Amarillo and here they've got the mountains the beach the trees you know it's they've got streams rivers ponds it's really pretty here uh-huh oh oh well this is pretty wooded area down here so in in a lot of parts yeah i know Texas is supposed to be flat but they've got you know down by the Denison Dam there's a lot of uh is it um-hum Sherman and Denison do you know my grandparents live in Durant they do they live close then in Durant Oklahoma yeah yeah real close i go there yeah you go where uh you go to visit them oh uh-huh yeah we used to go fishing in Lake Texoma oh yeah well down by Lake Texoma there's a bunch of wooded area this but Kentucky's beautiful they've got trees and trees are supposed to you know purify you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff it's a philodendron huh huh-uh oh really it's supposed to filter the air for you in your home i had one my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born three months ago four months ago yeah i do yeah i do well i'm going to have to get some um-hum do you smoke do you did you smoke when you when you were pregnant yeah i did i couldn't make myself quit i did cut down a lot i got i've i've got one vice and smoke is smoking is it i don't i don't drink and i try not to cuss and i don't i do well i mean i can understand that actually well very little and smoking i just i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen yeah well one thing i miss is uh is the people from Texas are are you know i miss their morals their values and everything it's uh yeah we're down here at the Bible belt aren't we uh i wasn't saved until i got down here and people down here are just there's so many Christians and it's so different from Kentucky but um-hum how'd you get involved in this research um i worked at TI for a while but then my brother-in-law works there and he got me into it oh i see huh how'd you get into it um i i was taking a voice IO class and um and actually doing some research and so they told me about this project uh-huh well it's fun i like talking to new people and i uh-huh half the time well a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl i've had to hang up and stuff but i enjoy it i talked people from well Carolina well Carolina now uh-huh um-hum up in uh Boston and New York well Boston is New York isn't it um-hum uh no Boston's above uh-huh no Boston Massachusetts but i've talked to people in New York but i've talked to a lot of people in Texas because i guess it's because of TI's down here yeah i've talked to a lot of people in Texas i had one call from actually from Charlotte North Carolina and Virginia and um uh-huh i can't remember where all um up north like you said i think one was from Boston well with Boston i love their accent i do i love a Boston accent accent i met a girl from Boston one time my husband was in the service so we went from Kentucky to Louisiana down here to Texas um-hum and his family's down here we're out of the service now but yeah he got out of it his unit right after Panama we went to Panama he went to Panama when Noriega was doing all that um-hum oh i bet you're glad uh-huh oh gosh and uh he  well hi Bob hi hi um my lawn and garden well that that's quite a topic because uh basically my husband takes care of it um um but what he's done is he's done a raised garden in the back yard because that we don't have dirt around here you understand that the it's it's sludge it's it's mud it's cruddy yeah right right yeah that's the so you know instead of uh trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented um we've just decided to do the raised garden and it works out great he just built like a twelve by eight box yeah out of um lumber that's you know the Wolmanized lumber and it's i guess it's maybe oh say eighteen inches wide so it makes a really nice box set that on top of the dirt um-hum and then worked and worked and worked with the soil i mean bag after bag from Wolfe Nursery to uh fill it up right but over the years it has produced some of the best vegetables and garden um you know type things that um-hum boy it's been really great and right now we have tomatoes out there and we've got you know have eggplant we're growing corn corn grows great here so um we really enjoy that a lot yeah oh that's good uh yeah well it's uh so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been uh many years since i've tried any of that uh i we did have uh we've been in our house uh where we're located now for about fifteen years oh and about uh eight nine about nine years ago i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard which means we don't have a backyard anymore uh so our our gardening is pretty much uh limited to plants uh you know shrubs and and trees that that kind of gardening right uh i in the years that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they weren't very good at all and i guess uh the soil and the and the bugs together it's it's amazing they come up well someone told me they they come in the in the uh packs you know the seed packages that's where the bugs come from sort of um-hum yeah i wouldn't doubt that uh i always like to try to grow squash and uh the squash bugs would would just go crazy yeah oh those oh yeah we've given up on those ourselves and uh and in in my experience with tomatoes was that if i got tomatoes at all they usually got uh sun blisters you know or or it would rain on them and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them yeah i guess we've got an early early grow variety or something like that and they're just now you know starting to turn red so before hopefully before all this heat hits but uh yeah but uh but there were you know there were years uh we i grew uh the little plum salad type tomatoes uh quite a bit and had real good luck with those we'll have some tomatoes uh-huh uh one year at at a the house we lived in before which was also here in Richardson uh we grew okra and i i picked okra up until almost Christmas i know what you mean green peppers grow like crazy too around here yeah and uh and i still i still occasionally will grow uh jalapeno peppers uh we we like jalapenos and they they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere right yeah definitely right right uh one of the things that we're doing talking about uh about lawns and shrubs uh we have a live oak tree in our front yard um-hum and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that yeah and we're in the process or at least in the planning stage of of putting in a bed around that oak tree i think that'd be really pretty really nice uh right yeah we're going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and and maybe you know maybe a few low plants under there i think i think that Asian jasmine just is so aggressive it'll take no time at all to surround that tree and probably your house and your back yard and your pool the way it goes right and uh right right we uh uh uh we uh brought some plants out we're from both from East Texas and we brought some plants in from there and uh one one of the things that we brought uh unintentionally was uh violets oh oh which is like almost like a ground cover and they really spread they really spread out and grow uh pretty rapidly when they you know when they're growing well oh oh that would be a good idea but uh but they uh they are i guess uh not an annual but a they they volunteer to come back every year but they do die off during the winter i've forgotten what the term is for that yeah but uh but they do die back during the winter so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that yeah well that you know one project we're looking at is we're building a deck out back and we want to put a tree in and we've been looking around and maybe you could you know suggest something but but uh um the tree that we've sort of you know come upon is a Bradford pear and we wanted it for shade and we wanted it for you know for the leaf and um that's um-hum yeah um i i don't i'm not familiar with that pear tree uh but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah you know right it does it's yeah it's ornamental uh and then the uh of course the leaves drop off during the winter right so right that's true yeah we have uh we've had real good luck with uh and again these are like volunteer trees that we transplanted from east Texas but we've got a couple uh well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees oh red bud and uh we've got one of those on our patio uh we've got a lot of rock and and around in our one area of our patio and we brought a a red bud tree in and it has done very well it has a a a little larger leaf than uh maybe even than a pear tree i know it's got larger leaves than a plum tree has um-hum the uh the leaves are probably uh oh four inches or so in diameter and uh you know makes a pretty good uh tree it that would be a great shade tree then it it has uh of course during the early spring it has the red you know the red flowers that are really pretty um-hum uh the only problem wit h it is it does have a seed pod uh you know a little it's a little flat bean type seed pod that uh will drop off you know uh when uh when they start drying out so there's a little bit of clean up work for that um but as long as you mow the grass around well you said it was around rocks but yeah yeah always it's uh with with our in our case uh it's fairly close to our swimming pool oh and so the uh the flowers uh uh blow in there they don't drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so there's a good a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but it's you know it's not too bad even at that so well that's just in the springtime too isn't it right and uh but uh y eah we we've really enjoyed that uh the live oak tree that we have uh is in the front and of course the live oak is uh it's susceptible to bending by the wind it it it leans away from the predominant wind direction oh and i think i think you'll find that uh we also have an apple tree uh in our side yard and it does the same thing the the southwesternly winds southwesternly winds which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those trees lean toward the northeast yeah and uh so it's but that's uh the live oak tree that's you'll find that uh pretty much anywhere that there are if there's a grove of live oaks growing they're going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind oh that's interesting get to know all these things uh if you if you go down along the uh Texas coast there a lot of them grow you know down there and you'll see them and there'll just be like twenty five or thirty of them growing real close together and they'll all every one of them be leaning away from water away from the from the water mostly leaning away from well that's interesting yeah i know that um we've done some other things with the grass and trying to yeah you know get the right combination of grass here right the uh because it's what kind of grasses are you growing well we see ours was a model house so when they set it up they had like these cement walkways across the front yard um-hum yeah and they had planted bermuda and then when they took the cement walkways out they stuck in um what what is that Saint Augustine stuff Saint Augustine right and i am a transplant here from the north myself and so when i saw that Saint Augustine i said oh weeds and i spent i mean weeks just pulling it up bag by bag hm until i went to the nursery one day and found out they were selling it by plugs you know and i could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of stuff i'd thrown out so we're trying to um right yeah after after this winter we had a lot of winter kill and hopefully you know some of the Bermuda will take over and because i really like that grass right yeah what you what you will find uh with the Saint Augustine grass is it's very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms yeah that yeah the grubs you know uh the the grub worm is the larva of the uh June beetle um-hum the June bug beetle and uh the grub worms uh in the late spring uh the the beetles come in and and they lay their eggs in the grass and then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off right and uh we we had Saint Augustine uh in uh our yard before i mean before we the house we were in before and one year all of the Saint Augustine in our backyard died  okay okay are you currently active in any type of exercise program no you're not no i get enough without having to do it if i exercised i'd be too thin is that right uh-huh i just have one of those metabolisms that um doesn't require exercise doesn't require it really if i if yeah i i wish i had such luck well i think you kind of are born with those type of genes my wife is that way i uh course i've always uh i've always been in fairly good condition but and i do exercise uh lately i've been off of it because i've had shoulder problems but uh um-hum that seems to be on the mend and i think i'm pretty close to getting back on a program again well i did have a program of walking because i enjoyed doing it in the evening and i had a dog at that time and i walked him and i kind of lost like ten pounds and i said whoa better stop i do notice as i get older i i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to um-hum and it's much much harder for me to control you know the few pounds here and there um-hum so whenever i do have to lose five or ten pounds whatever it's a major effort whereas i could used to just lay off two or three meals uh you know for a day or so and then you know i could lose you know five pounds now i'd have to do that for two solid weeks before i'd lose five pounds so well my daughter really uh is into uh fitness uh of course she's in uh the nursing profession and she knows how beneficial it is even though she says mom you you know you really need to exercise because it does a lot for your body other than maintain your wealthy your weight um i think it's important when they when they talk about you know getting your heart rate up and yes and and she has a very strenuous um exercise mode that she keeps herself in plus she has um a family that she takes care of and a forty hour work week so i'm really amazed at her stamina but she um has inherited uh a little problem from her father's side because he did have a weight problem but he maintains his weight now because he jogs like uh nine miles a day nine yeah and he gets that adrenalin high and i guess that really i've never reached it um i used to run uh you know quite heavy i used to i used to run like three and maybe four miles three or four times a week um-hum but uh over the years of the pounding and everything else my knees just don't support it any more so i've i do walk and i do ride my bike and we do have a workout facility here at work and i do i used to be on a fairly rigorous uh weight lifting program and and uh riding the bike the stationary bike um-hum uh but uh then i started i think it was just from trying to lift too much um-hum i started getting the shoulder problems and uh so i've been off now for about four months well i think the old adage is quite true in this case with exercise that moderation is the key that's right if you know your limits and you stay within those limits i think that you and you're happy with the exercise that you do because i think it's um very imperative that you have a happy um attitude about exercise otherwise it becomes a chore and a task and and you you think of it as work and um it doesn't really uh do a lot for you but if you think of it as a uh a source of uh well being and health and uh uh have a positive attitude i think you you go a long way with that the one thing's i mean i enjoy doing it i i enjoy any kind of any any kind of outdoor uh activity exercise whatever and in fact i used i do it during lunch i i really look forward to it um-hum uh i did overdo it and i know it and i keep trying to tell myself that i'm not twenty years old any more i can't i just can't keep up and uh um-hum um yes i and i've got to learn just you know when i get to a certain point i use use it to maintain i'm not i'm not after uh you know the uh twenty year old body any more i'm not uh i'm just not geared that way you're just uh focused then on on maintaining your health because if you do the exercise naturally you're going to feel a lot healthier yeah on just staying in condition and uh but i had my uh cholesterol was down to it was i think around a hundred and twenty two oh that's good yeah very good my my blood pressure was real good that's very good um-hum and uh my uh percent body fat was less than eighteen percent well that's marvelous so i mean overall i was in very good shape now after four months of being off exercise i've put on probably fifteen pounds um-hum wow and taking on you know taking on quite some bad habits of snacking and everything else so i know i've got a major event um-hum um-hum uh once i get back i think probably within a couple of weeks i'll be able to get back to it again well i think the way you're talking now that you're already motivated for that goal i know it's got to happen uh i'm i'm slowly growing out of my wardrobe so i have no choice i can't afford a new one so oh sure okay but uh but it's it's something i've done pretty much all my life i uh i played college ball and and i've i've always liked staying in shape and it just really bothers me when i'm not so uh and and and plus it's just important i think it does a lot for your mental um exercise too uh keeping um a clear mind i think your mind is clearer when you exercise well i sleep better at night i think clearly you know i'm um-hum um-hum doing something uh i just i have real poor self-esteem if i know that i haven't done something i just feel lazy and i feel like i've cheated myself and and i've gone through four months of that and i'm kind of like you know it's time to get back on yeah and you'd have yeah you've you've beat your head yourself over the head long enough yeah i i hate it i really do i hate it yeah sure yeah and it has an effect on your family life too that too and like i said my wife is one of those you know she could sit down and eat a whole choco late cake um-hum uh-huh not show and and never never show a an ounce of it um-hum and she's got one of those fast metabolisms my daughter does too um-hum and i see them eat and then i'm of course i'm impelled also um-hum and uh that just that that seems to be the worst the worst thing i have a problem with is i tend to like food way too much and uh back when back when i was working out when i got home i didn't tend to want to eat this much i was i came home i felt satisfied i'd get out and work a little bit in the yard i'd come in i'm hot um-hum and i'm a little bit tired and i'd just and i'd just grab a a salad or a snack or something like that and then that would be the end of it well uh one of uh eating is one of the joys of life you know and uh it is for me yeah well it is for a lot of people and uh you you surely should get satisfaction out of eating you know because you socialize and you're maintaining your your body uh you're you're maintaining all of your uh faculties that run the body your brain and your flesh and your bones and all of that and eating is a pleasure that is one of the basic uh motivators in life is eating yep that's for sure um-hum but uh i've got to get on the wagon and i know it but i like i said i mean i uh i have probably three people in my neighborhood who enjoy running and walking and riding the bikes and stuff like that so i mean there's there's plenty of opportunities um-hum sure and they've got these i just have to do it marvelous health clubs too that you know you can use their facilities yeah we in fact we've got several of them uh you know within just a couple of miles um-hum um-hum in fact uh you know TI has a real good one right there in in Lewisville oh yes uh-huh um-hum not too far from where i live so that that that's something i can use oh sure certainly so well i guess that's about all i can say about exercising well that's fine i think we covered quite a bit well it was a joy it was nice talking with you same here take care bye-bye take care bye-bye  well Pat what do you wear to work well it depends on the day and what i feel like i don't have a um-hum a real like strict dress code as far as you know suits and everything i can wear pretty much what i want as long as it's decent uh-huh yeah you know i can wear blue jeans i can wear a dress i can dress up um-hum so it just depends on the mood i'm in and where i'm going you know if i got a customer coming in then i'll dress up If not you know hey yeah my my schedule yeah my schedule's pretty similar i um i teach so on the days i teach i teach a couple days a week so whenever i teach i try and wear a tie blue jeans uh-huh but uh but that's i wear normally just wear like well that's all khaki pants and a shirt and tie i never wear a sport coat that's ridiculous but then most of the time you know then i just have to uh i can wear jeans or yeah or just casual clothes i think they i think they frown on shorts and sneakers but i think i could probably get away with jeans and sneakers uh oh we can't even wear shorts yeah i could well if i don't have to see students and uh i'm just in my lab and no one sees me then i'm probably okay oh no shorts are no no go here you can't wear shorts you can't wear uh like halters and stuff like that and to me really you can't wear anything that's um-hum yeah uh-huh uh outside clothing you know like for the summer time and uh in the winter time i guess you can pretty much wear what you want as long as it's presentable that's what i consider right um-hum yeah well that makes sense uh-huh you know just don't get too outrageous here yeah as long as you're clean and yeah that makes a lot of sense and not too dressy like you know after five stuff i've never some of them get sort of touchy too so uh-huh yeah that's true and uh the women you see you have you can't wear halters or nothing like that i mean at all um-hum like even if you got a jacket on you got to have a bra on and all that stuff yeah which no big deal to me so but as far as dress for dressing for work that i don't it doesn't bother me i'd prefer if we had a uniform yeah um-hum i really would to save a lot of money if you had a uniform yeah that would matter that would because when i while i was in the service and see i had clothes that i could wear whenever i got ready but you had to wear that uniform to work and so you knew what you was going to wear wasn't no what am i going to wear today um-hum yeah and you don't have to worry about fashion and stuff too you know buying nicer clothes and things yeah that makes a lot of sense nope that's right i wouldn't mind having a uniform people think i'm crazy but well you know my mother's a waitress and she has like three uniforms that she sort of wears in rotation and she likes that you know uh-huh that's right yeah because it it doesn't mess up your clothes either um-hum yeah your your you know because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins it it's just ruined um-hum that's right where the the uniform as as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but you know that's it doesn't it's made of polyester so it doesn't stain like cotton or wool would you know yeah well see if you work at a fast food because i work at Wendy's sometime on the weekends um-hum and they give you the uniform so it it's supplied so you know if it messes up hey it's their uniform they messed it up you only wear it you know to Wendy's so if you mess it up at Wendy's yeah um-hum yeah um-hum there's no big deal yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense but you know uh of course TI i'm sure if they ever went to uniforms they're not going to just give them to you um-hum that's something but now some of the people around here do wear uniforms you know the facility guys or maintenance crew and the truck drivers and all of them have have TI uh-huh yeah um-hum that's probably the people that probably the people that are prone towards getting dirty yeah the yeah that's what they are too yeah with the type of job that you have you might be getting dirty either either manual label labor where you'll perspire heavily or uh or where you'll come in contact with uh oil and things yeah yeah because they're always in the high space up you know working on stuff right um-hum yeah and all i do is i sit at a desk and program but that's not going to get me dirty so yeah that's what yeah i find too um if you're a programmer do you get cold does your how's your air conditioning work well uh mine it works pretty good i have a sweater at work because sometimes it gets chilly and everything you know but uh but the whole building's like that i'm not in a clean room or nothing so um-hum yeah um-hum oh oh see yeah because my office is really heavily air conditioned because i guess they they keep the air conditioning on all the time where they don't in a lot of the other offices because of the computers and um um-hum yeah well see i just have my the whole building is computerized okay and so it's all air conditioned but my my computer is like by my desk and then right um-hum yeah um-hum you go to another cube and then somebody else's but uh the computer rooms now they're real cold and i don't have to work in one of those yeah yeah see sometimes my air conditioning gets really cold i think it's probably because my office is one of the only ones air conditioned in a yeah a large area you know probably probably that's why i get because sometimes boy i'll get i'll freeze it's so cold in there especially when it's ninety degrees outside oh well then yeah it's just no matter and seems like it kicks in extra hard right yeah and blows on my legs man one time i left i thought i was going to i thought i was going to freeze the one day i wore shorts to the office because i was just going to be in my lab and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know and jeez if it wasn't the air conditioner wasn't blowing it wasn't fifty five degrees yeah um-hum cold huh i think the reason why we can't wear shorts is because then the women and the men would be in competition that's true a lo t of those nice looking legs yeah see and then you guys couldn't work yeah i was just laughing it's funny that um we get clothing you know because uh i'm i'm in graduate school i only work part time and my wife uh-huh we recently we decided we'd buy a sewing machine because that would be a good investment you know and we could make clothes and save money so she's made me shorts uh-huh well of course you know she makes shorts and she says here i made you shorts and they're uh they're a nice material nice checkered plaid material here but but she didn't put a fly in them you know the pattern she bought didn't have a fly so it's like well they're fine for her but uh you know they're just everyday summer shorts you know but there's no fly yeah yeah you kidding me those are real good for men to wear so yeah they're not for a guy that really changes your the whole way you do your day so i was laughing i thought that was funny you know because well i i was up at the office and everybody says oh jeez those new shorts they i think they were laughing because they are sort of a wild that's right color you know but i was just crossing through to get my mail and stuff um-hum now my boss now he he golfs every weekend uh-huh so he's got different outfits and he cracks me up with these color codes yeah the uh his aqua colors and i tell him see only people like you on the golf course wears them colors that's the only place you could probably wear it you know that's probably true without being laughed at uh-huh yeah i'm not i've never i laugh at the wardrobe my father-in-law wears golf clothes and it's the only time he puts on those funny clothes yeah he doesn't wear those in the back yard or casually around yeah uh-huh now oh yeah yep no just when they go to play golf just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes hat's true now i think IBM now IBM has a strict dress code when i uh i went to apply for them before i came here and they men they used to have to they have to wear white shirts i don't care what their job is they have to wear a suit um-hum um-hum yeah and see to me that's ridiculous because you're working with all that xerox machines and stuff like that all that black ink huh-uh no give me a break dude no i think them them people should be able to wear blue jeans um-hum yeah um-hum you know because that stuff gets really bad yeah but they have that dress code i i you know i also know um EDS yeah uh EDS i have some friends that interviewed with EDS and uh you know they interviewed while they were in college so they didn't really have a suit with them and the woman said to them well your second interview would be they have a dress uh-huh here but oh and on that day i would say wear a suit because i guess they just had on a sport coat and the one guy even had like um a gel in his hair you know his hair was sort of slicked back uh-huh yeah you know which is popular with the kids and and she says oh and you know uh i wouldn't put the gel in my hair you know in other words you're to borrow a suit two or three piece suit yeah with no gel in your hair you know and that would she made it pretty clear during the interview you know the the first interview how they were supposed to dress for the second interview you know yeah God so i thought that was really funny too you know i don't think that should be your hair i mean yeah i guess so because some people do get wild with their hair um-hum um-hum you know with these haircuts now some of these haircuts boy i tell you i i don't know i don't think my hair has probably changed in ten years it's funny because my son is fifteen um-hum and he's into this fading crap you know he he's into what the fade like it looks like no hair uh uh oh really wait a minute and so he has hair though he can i can only let him fade it a little bit uh-huh i tell him he's got to have hair all over or none one or the other you know you're not going to be going around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head and people's names carved in your head and no no huh-uh and not going no where with me he's not yeah i see them i see the kids with the the things cutting their hair all the time i told him no no hum-um we can't have that i'm not one of them liberated parents i guess i don't know well that's you know my dad was the same way i thought it was really funny back in the nineteen seventies my brother came home with cowboy boots on while was growing up in Pittsburgh and my dad called my brother Tex for about the next four weeks yeah uh-huh you know and other than calling him Tex he barely talked to him because he was so angry he was wearing cowboy boots well down here that's no big deal yeah i thought it was just so funny you know my dad we're not in Texas it was very funny you know and all that over a pair of cowboy boots and it was finally my mother convinced him she you know the cowboy boots give you about uh an inch lift you know they sort of have a heavier heel yeah and she and we're all short the whole family's short so she said well Sam if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may be  okay um do you have any advice for college i'm i'm i'm full of advice i'm still a graduate student so uh-huh well having been there not too long ago and my wife having only recently completed a doctorate i'm fairly full of it of it myself uh oh hum the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school is that definitely you have to early on define what it is you want to do yeah or at least what area you want to be in uh i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized i went through a number of them uh undergraduate schools hm before i found a a good school that was more general uh to give me time to make up my mind oh that's interesting i went to a a liberal arts school actually at first and you weren't really even um they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were in your second year and then you you know you had i think you had to pick it by the by the by the end of second you had to pick some sort of major but until then they didn't sort of force you they they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then certain requirements so that so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything so it wasn't that specialized so that that's wonderful i'm a great proponent of liberal arts education for anybody yeah yes uh being an engineer now i believe in it even more strongly than i did before um-hum i was just on a committee recently actually sponsored by uh the American Association for the Advancement of Science trying to sort of you know where where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together you know because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts and then the other way around as well people are getting just pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues so well thus far it's working to my advantage uh the great gap historically has with engineers has been while they may have all this technical information they have no way of imparting it to except to another engineer um-hum and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that non engineers can understand well that must be helpful well it's a lot of fun at the moment that could be very helpful yeah well i figure that that that that's probably the thing that i would most tell any parent you know to tell to tell their kids i think probably make sure the kid goes to a school where they can get sort of a general education and save specialization i guess for graduate school unless they're sure they want early on they want to do something like engineering or something or they can even at that i have a son that who is only nine at the moment but i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality and uh if he decides to pursue that i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college before i'll even let him go to an engineering college and yes that'll add one year to his education experience hum yeah but that's that's a good idea well where i am right now actually i'm at the University of Rochester and that's a pretty good engineering school i think i think we do some they have a pretty good engineering here they also have a program a fairly large liberal arts college as well a sort of a separate a separate you know college uh arts arts and sciences college um yes it is and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in in in everything and i know people i do uh i do work in language processing and and and at least one person who's in my field started off as an engineer started off as an electrical electrical an electrical engineer student and then switched over at some point into language processing because he found that he enjoyed it more so they do force them people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here which i think is wonderful oh i agree uh i have the experience uh the last school that i went to was Mississippi State University which is historically an engineering and agricultural school right uh the typical land grant university every state's got one um-hum anyway it while it has both engineering and liberal arts the engineering students tend to cluster together you know they're in classes together even when they're outside of the engineering department yes um-hum and they don't learn the communications they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of of endeavor it's you know it's kind of like hum if i were king for a day and got to and got to make one rule my rule would be no one could get out of high school without an entire year of philosophy um um-hum that would be very good actually and it's that's not even true in our colleges right you you don't need any philosophy at all in school um-hum or some yeah or or or or some other thought provoking area you know very true we had uh when i went to undergraduate we had uh um went to Brandeis don't know if you know of it or not um we had uh uh a requirement freshman year of just humanities then you were given a choice of um you know there were ten or twelve or whatever fifteen or fifteen different courses that that you could take but they all centered they all came out of Philosophy English and Literature departments and they were they were they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read you know for so the first year Humanities courses everyone had to read the Iliad and and and so forth and what they did though was they all approached it from right from very different you know so so they had you could have one class in the philosophy of something that that the philosophy of Greek mythology or something that actually approached this or um one literature you know or a literature a literature course or just all sorts of different perspectives on it and people got to choose pick and choose but but by the end everyone had a good sample of of of sort of how to think about these things non scientifically you know and and uh and that sort of forced them but i believe that that that that that that you one of the one of the best things to do at least for me in school was was i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses um i was forced to take i think you know some sort of art history course and you we all grumbled about it at first but then afterward we all wound up taking extra art history classes because it just seemed like something we we didn't totally know nothing about but just enjoyed very much doing and something i never would have done if i if if i wasn't forced to take it yes i really i remember that experience hum hum that and uh extra music classes yes um-hum and that and that really is something that that i notice like uh i talk to a lot of my friends at schools that are more specialized and they don't have that they just you know they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take and that was all they never had some of the more fun classes i guess i feel a little more worldly now well that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school yes i'm i'm i'm hoping i'm hoping have have you gone straight through yes i i graduated um college in eighty seven and i just went straight through um i'm finishing up next year so yeah i didn't i didn't take any break or anything yet i've been trying actually in graduate school i've been trying to do the same thing take courses outside it's completely outside my area and i'm finding that in graduate school it's a lot harder because uh i just don't have the time anymore to sort of sit in a course that i'm not getting graded for whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it now i can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily so i have to try and go myself and i went for like two or three weeks and realized not enough time for the work unfortunately that's true are you pursuing a Master's or a Doctorate i'm pursuing a Doctorate in Psychology so i'm just wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead uh what else i i think i oh well let me let me encourage you to stop stop and experience life along the way oh i i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixty six um-hum uh six years and a and a war later uh i got a degree an undergraduate degree and then fifteen years after that i got the first of a set of master's degrees and four years after that i got another master's degree hum so you had real world experience in the middle there oh yes and that helped you think or that was it certainly it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier um-hum hum yeah i'm getting some of that um i have i have sort of some work experience yet my wife is not an academic at all my wife is sort of in the real world and i so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world getting you know real world especially she works in uh um she works in something i she she works for a temporary agency and and i and i never would have had she's the office supervisor i never would have had any i've i've learned much just sort of by watching her and her and her business as well so yeah so i i can see where that might be a well vicarious learning is a wonderful thing uh you know it certainly means that we don't have to experience everything but experience is a wonderful teacher also yeah that's my oh yeah yes agreed agreed well i'll i'll take that i'll take that and think that through a little bit um my wife as as as i may have mentioned just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago and and she pursued her education along the lines that i did yes um-hum with lots of break in between and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now she has an awful lot of experience to draw on no longer is  there we go um normally it takes me a lot longer to get through but this is pretty quick do you have children oh yes i do i have five oh oh my goodness tell then you've obviously had some experience with child care um both ends actually really uh what do you mean i tended in my home for about twelve years oh wow and uh uh now what did you look for when you were looking for child care when i was looking for child care um-hum i've never had to uh uh it's been the situation where i had to oh it it put my own children in child care thank goodness it um-hum yeah that's nice i was uh lucky i was um i've always been very grateful for that um-hum excuse me just a minute um-hum i'm sorry that's okay but it has been a a factor my youngest is now in a uh preschool which is different than um-hum day care i guess you know per say uh-huh um well what you know i work in a personnel agency and um so i'm constantly interviewing and placing people in jobs um-hum and i've just really become discouraged in people's own sense of responsibility and dependability um and what what's hard for me is i don't have children but i would imagine once i do i'm probably going to need to find some sort of child care um-hum and it worries me it worries me a lot because i just um i i don't i don't know who i could feel comfortable trusting my children with It oh it's very hard it's very hard it i yeah i always felt like i ran a real tip top in home child care i think there are advantages to to child care in the home but oh i'd be very very careful if i were putting my own children in a home um-hum um-hum i know they uh and even if you get a place that's just perfect just perfect you know it's clean and the people are responsible and and the uh um-hum the other kids are decent and there are programs provided and foods done properly and all those kinds of things that you think of you know to to worry about um-hum um-hum um-hum i you know you your children build bonds with those kids that are there yeah um-hum and yet and they're usually very young preschool age um-hum and yet when that's gone um-hum yeah you don't you don't even know who those other mothers are chances are they're like little cousins you know or brothers and sisters and yet they never see one another again i know oh i know um-hum so you know i think that's a um-hum that's a factor too oh it certainly is um most of my uh i come from a family of nine children and um-hum oh wow myself my own you know children my uh nuclear family um-hum and most of us have somehow been able to work out either aunts and uncles uh siblings you know older siblings younger siblings you know some of us have had children that were quite stretched out in age or that's great situations where you know kind of joint where mothers worked at night or you know alternated or dad worked out of the home so he could tend the kids you know different things and um-hum um-hum not very many of us have had to actually have that full day every day well day care in a herd kind of situation and the one not only yeah not only does that make you uh just have you know more peace of mind but isn't that great for the child too i think so to not be with strangers and even though they're you know getting to know the people and it's probably good for them to you know be out of the house and all that but just to have a parent with them so few families are able to do that these days that the fact that you're able to do it and and that your siblings could that's just wonderful well and at the time that i was doing you know in home child care i i felt real strongly you know that that was a needed to be a real viable opportunity for parents to to have that option that they didn't feel you know a lot of people most people cannot afford to have a nanny um-hum um-hum or a governess you know type situation where that um-hum housekeeper someone in the home their own home is tending to their own children um-hum day in and day out that's just a luxury most people can't afford if they could afford that they probably wouldn't be going to work except for the person who's got a career you know who's um i think more and more i think we're going to see um-hum oh yeah right um-hum um-hum child care change i think there's going to be more corporate involvement i think we're going to see a lot more um definitely um-hum paternity leave and options that involve the dads more definitely and we're going to see more like you were saying corporate i think we're going to see more uh maybe even a corporate contribution i mean just companies helping to to pay for it because it's just not flex times yeah yeah um-hum well basically you know we already have my husband works for a large uh oil corporation uh it's a necessity um-hum and they have you know a deduction kind of plan where it's tax free you know if you put it in ahead of time yeah yes that's what we do here uh-huh pre tax dollars that that you're yeah that's that's what we have here i think that's um-hum um-hum and on site care uh-huh those kinds of oh they do have on site care no no they don't i'm saying i think that i s one of one way of the future that we will see oh i'm sorry oh um-hum boy yeah and and much needed i i like to see those kinds of things that emphasize the family unity rather than sending people off and you know because we just have a generation of people that are not going to be happy with um-hum either parent not when and our economy is almost precludes one person staying home if they stay home they've still got to contribute somehow oh i know um-hum yes you know financially yeah oh yeah um and and i guess you know it's just it's too scary to be reading the papers and hearing on the news they always say that um you know all these horrible things happen in the most comfortable places like uh sexually abused children it's happening with a neighbor or with somebody that they think they knew well and trusted um and um-hum um-hum yeah yeah they say probably eighty percent that's the scary thing is that you think okay these people are good because you can trust them and and all that then they're the ones that might you know turn around and and be the ones that cause the problem it's it's really scary it's um well i my husband is a professor or i should say he will be a professor and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine and you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can be around you know not necessarily at the same time but at least one of us be there one woman that we have in our office um he works during the day and she works in the evenings part-time um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and so you know even though she's only working part-time she's not spending money on the day care so it's almost like you're not um you know maybe you're not making as much but you're not spending as much either um-hum i read the most interesting article here oh gosh it's been about two months ago right around Easter time i remember thinking it yeah was when i read it about a husband and a wife that honest and truly share the same job for Arco Oil and Gas um-hum oh my goodness i'm trying to think it was computer related they were both over a department he worked one week she works the next they have two children um-hum oh wow isn't that ideal how very unusual you know i mean for to find two people who even could do the same job or have the same education to do it but they'd met on site you know and yes right right the relationship developed and you know they married and and a company that can allow that yeah that would support it and the uh and of course you always wonder you know when you read it in the newspaper is it really all you know right is this true or what did they just ignore half the team who can't stand this arrangements but the team members that were interviewed all seemed to be very supportive of it and uh um-hum that is what a neat idea and said that their that their management styles meshed real well um-hum and wow that's amazing isn't that interesting very novel you know yes that is very good i like that um it's you know you hear of women you know maybe like on flex time thing you know but you're talking file clerk i mean you know you're not talking right yeah i know you're not you know both with master's degrees yeah isn't that interesting wow i would imagine that must be hard to to not bring your work home though you know um they probably um-hum um-hum our uh our dentists are husband and wife team work out of the same office oh really oh yeah and uh they have children well that's that's good i mean if some couples want to do that i think that's great and uh you you just got to change your life around somehow when you're going to have kids no question about it that's and yet it's worth it um-hum it truly is worth it you know there are some days when you wonder if it is but you know face it you know the yeah population is decreasing you know and somebody's going to have these little babies and yeah um-hum yeah now do you are your kids is are your older ones at an age where they're taking care of the younger ones yet or oh they are oh yes my uh my big ones are wonderful to help with my little one and uh oh good we are we're to the point now where we only have one that has to be sat like you would say baby sitting or tending but i still believe that it's very important that moms be in the home in the afternoon um-hum um-hum when those kids come home from school and stuff that's just yeah yeah um-hum you know that's i think it's just as critical for middle school and high schoolers as it is um-hum  uh well i mean i've had time to think about it because uh we've had uh i i there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to so oh okay so um i i was thinking about a couple things uh and whether they are serious some things are serious and some aren't i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is uh-huh is uh not the biggest thing but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information uh-huh yes uh situation that you uh that you find yourself almost compromised into giving if you want any sort sort of credit extensive extensive checks and um-hum um-hum and things of that nature when um i i i mean i i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy simply i i do to i do feel it is but i don't know whether some of the questions they ask are legitimate uh-huh uh-huh uh because they are the ones who are making the profit out of your well what's scary is uh about two three four months ago on a Sunday in the Sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here The Dallas Morning News uh-huh they showed a reporter and a um and a copy editor how they went out and they just took um a fellow in John Q Public in Dallas and all they had was let's see they had his birthday they had something like his birth date the street address um they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name excuse me and it was um very scary to see what they found out i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against you know two or three houses through a two divorces children's names locations um it was really frightening well i guess i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact that once you give your social security number there are people i guess who are who are uh-huh uh actually collecting all this all the time and and profiles are given i understand uh i read the other day that uh these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone yeah uh-huh uh all all they need now is your telephone number which i guess is involved in this controversy of whether they can reveal your telephone number or not i i i feel that is an invasion of privacy but it right uh-huh i do too yeah i don't the other thing i don't like is um in terms of uh like we just moved here from uh Minneapolis and uh yeah to get the the very nice townhouse that we're in you were required by the property management firm that was representing a private landlord you know husband and wife owners um who had never done this before they um asked us for again an astounding amount of information and what we really didn't have the same opportunity you know and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too yeah exactly um in terms of the credit yeah i know um we're also going through adoption now in for an adoption and i mean after we gave our fingerprints to the FBI you you look at each other yeah you look at each other and say yeah my God well too late now um so i mean it's it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try um yeah yeah i i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me uh uh-huh go ahead uh well by by uh i make my living by uh flying airplanes for for a company and uh as a as a uh an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing uh-huh uh-hum uh-huh i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time so i when i finish a a certain flight on a random basis i have to uh-huh uh have a written a drug test and and and that's without i uh probably cause uh-huh uh-huh and uh a and in the end now i mean they've tested they've spent forty million dollars and they've found uh i think uh in pilots anyway of something like uh no it isn't uh eighty six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up uh three guys have come up positive and one of them was a bad test so positive for anything see yeah see uh and i just started working well for an electronics firm down here i used to be a reporter and then now i'm in corporate communications and uh part of that excuse me was as a new hire that i had to take a drug test and i had never been asked that and i thought yeah yeah drug test right um i really didn't like it um i i have very mixed feelings about i don't disagree or agree with you um i think i i think that it's well and you're in that field so i don't know but it's yeah you know we lived in uh Minneapolis when the Northwest Airlines pilot in the Dakotas yeah that hit the fan like uh you uh you're obviously aware of that um yeah right yes i am i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of if they're going to do random um i i don't agree with random i guess i would look for a standard in consistency yeah you know in terms of maybe at set intervals so that everybody knows what's going on um i don't see a problem with that i do think i see some level of necessity um in something where people are transporting other people uh only because of the things you've heard about The problem is the reason i feel that way even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the you know majority um yeah i i can understand the public's alarm to it but i guess having done this all my life i knew that there wasn't a problem and and it indeed it has proved out that way but now try to get the damn thing repealed you know yeah i'm not alarmed yeah you can't yeah i know it's um i guess i feel bad because uh not only that but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints i mean what what what happens if you say no If you say no then you're excluded and i doesn't seem the courts right right it's a matter and that's um exactly what it is i mean that that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion um if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to Romania i mean if you hate to say that but that's the way it is yeah that's right it's my feeling also that that that although i i don't know if it's that serious i but that was part of the question uh-huh i do feel the courts have have held up a great deal of of our privacy i mean particularly look in in some of the in some of the uh-huh uh i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy which i support of course but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that it does seem that we've uh-huh we've slipped and that's eroded or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that you know it's fair game to you you have to answer these questions of course uh-huh uh i don't know i i feel there has been an erosion and i don't really know how serious it is except i don't like it in terms of the privacy yeah that in it and also i agree with that and in the in terms of the question um in terms uh i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade um and that was pre AIDS and all the other um things that were probably there but just not excuse me labeled and i have a real problem with medical professionals um um it goes back to the things like drug screening but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment um and i think this is much stronger than you know pilots or uh train engineers being screened um the transmission of the AIDS virus uh-huh yeah um it it that's a real ethical problem i mean i don't i don't have the answer i i you know i mean i think of the young girl in Florida who well yeah that's was she from your part of the country or was she from the young girl that uh contracted AIDS through her dentist allegedly and then they proved it yeah i don't i don't know um i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um What was that oh yeah yeah yeah right well i mean it it just take that that step now where where now we feel there's a need to do that and the next thing you know then uh-huh uh there's always the need to to go and inspect lockers of high school students that oh yeah the i guess the question is uh the the thing for me is who sets the parameters or who has the control you know yeah i guess so i mean well uh good luck to you you just moved to Texas from Minneapolis yeah yeah i don't hold out much hope for you i think they'll be a cultural shock i mean i was based there a lot uh several times in the service and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the in in at least in criminal law some of the some of the latitudes that the police had but oh it's it's terrible i'm uh very seriously not more than just seriously i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall and yeah if i figure out that's still what i really want to do and oh yeah the the things i'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy the way the law is interpreted presented yeah um it's no better than journalism um except in journalism it's words um this is very frightening in that uh oh and in uh in Texas they they do they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents um whether it's domestic or international they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check yet if you're caught with let's just say um that somebody who's in need not us but somebody who's need of carting um aluminum beer cans around they haven't touched them they haven't drank them they picked them up off the street and they want to take them to a recycling uh resource um yeah for money or whatever um they've they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again um because they've been arresting people like that well i mean i don't understand if you if you don't if they don't make a criminal check why do you have to be fingerprinted you know because um in our case one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to deal because you have to deal with the IN yeah because you have to deal with the uh immigration immigration service oh i see oh the state doesn't require it well that's kind of that's rather that's rather unusual isn't it yeah it is it's uh the whole thing is i mean there's again there's no consistency you know like in your in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly um i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval or you know i mean there just well i guess i guess the extension of that is why why not the next thing you know we'll just stop a random amount of motorists and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street they they do that in Texas oh they do they don't do it for drugs what they do is they check to see if you've got uh current insurance or they check to to see if you're permits are yeah well there's there's all sorts of scare tactics i guess to to invade our privacy and yeah i know and it's kind of um what's the word i want i don't it's just to me it's just frightening you know i mean the old uh i'm old enough now where George Orwell uh way past the time yeah i just going to say nineteen eighty four is come and is come and gone but it's here yeah yeah it's exactly true i mean i and the computers of course helps that The computer abilities store that information well look at what we're talking now i mean it's look how we're talking now i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger you know  where are you from Tina um i'm from Maryland and um i have one son who's months almost sixteen months old are are you married or yeah uh-huh i have i have two children i have a seven year old and a three year old you are oh and uh so i try to spend as much time as possible with them that's good uh what kind of things do you do well um we we do a lot of things with them you know Taylor Taylor my youngest is or my oldest is in school and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that oh how was it a big change in your life to uh have a child oh yeah um yeah it's really nice uh my husband uh um is is working most you know most of the time he's working long hours but uh uh-huh i'm staying home uh-huh uh i'm just working a couple days a month and um oh uh-huh what do you do during those those days um we we spend a lot of time at the playground and we go to the zoo and we go and we watch yeah well you said you said you worked a couple days a month though what do what do you do yeah yeah i'm a nurse oh are you so yeah so it's it's it's real easy to work out my schedule you know to uh get in to to still uh-huh stay in with that an and to have enough time to spend with Matthew he yeah yeah he's uh just now really starting to to get interested in a lot of things so um yeah i understand that yeah they really grow up quick especially at that early age yeah but my my wife was uh she worked part time when my oldest was was little and now she's staying home all the time but uh that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children oh yeah you know to go from you know nothing you know if you want to do something every night that's fine but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore so that's right and i think a lot of people are um are turning to well i think i think a lot of people are realizing that but still there are so many people that are you know have their careers first and it's uh i think it's really hurting the yeah yeah yeah i agree with you i the kids you know but i i think that my wife leaned that way and i'm really glad she did and you know i'm glad she's staying home but you know i know there are some days when she wishes she wishes she was back at work i know that's why i like to to work to work a couple days i think it's uh yeah it gives me a break yeah well see that's that's why i'm glad my wife did too because she worked either two to three three days a week and that got her out of the house and yet she'd get to spend you know three or four days with yeah yeah and so most of the time at home yeah uh we had started out like that and um i think that was really ideal uh yeah i do to i agree but then when you start having two of them it's you know a little bit tougher it's yeah because you've got to make a little more money to make that payoff and stuff yeah yeah it's difficult but are are you from the Maryland area uh-huh i'm i've i've lived here forever so really yeah i'm in i live in Germantown and uh are you where are you from um uh i'm in Dallas Texas in Dallas oh yeah so uh i'm i've lived here like eight years or so my wife's from Fort Worth oh uh but yeah i work for Texas Instruments okay oh so that explains well um i don't know i uh yeah that explains it doesn't it we we do a lot of things on the weekends together the family but uh yeah yeah but as far as during the week it's it's usually uh you know just my son and i and we're yeah what's your husband do uh he he works for Coca-Cola uh-huh so he uh he manages a plant out here an and it takes a lot of time oh oh yeah i'm sure it does but um it you know we take walks and go to the library and try to fill our day with things like that but um uh-huh yeah yeah what uh my wife did some teaching at like uh like a private tutoring place oh a Sylvan Learning Center this year and so that that got me to spend to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff oh because normally if if they need something they just go to mom yeah no matter what it is i mean i could i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them but right it's so much easier to go to mom i guess they get used to it so but you know we'd go to the library and do things like that yeah but that's good that's good i know my husband was real uh in the beginning when he uh he was transferred to a a larger plant and he um but he works about an hour and a half away from here from our home and uh so it takes him a little bit of time and oh yeah i'm not able to work during the week uh because of that he was i was working in the evening and he was coming home and i i could go to work but uh uh-huh yeah their relationship uh when i was able to work in the evenings uh really grew he you know just the time that they were spending together uh-huh yeah i think it it really it really helped to have that time together uh-huh it really does because i think you you know you grow closer was your uh was your husband i mean naturally a child i mean had had he been around children uh oh yeah he has uh he has seven other brothers and sisters and they have oh we have thirteen grand well his parents have thirteen grandchildren uh-huh so it's uh you know there's a lot of kids in the family and and he really enjoys it but uh right now it's kind of a difficult time but yeah yeah yeah and and the cost of living here is just so tremendously you know outrageous um yeah yeah it's difficult uh to do it any other way yeah i understand yeah um you know it's it's hard because then you're not getting to spend as much time with at home i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to that's right so yeah that that's a tough situation but then then again you know some you got to do what you got to do yeah you know to get along too so yeah yeah at least i i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home it uh uh-huh well well like i said my wife normally feels that way there are days when uh i come home and she says here take these kids i'm getting out i know so she's she's had about enough during those days i know but but for the most part i you know i've really feel like that's led the way that you know what just like what you said with the cost of living and everything i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an yeah and won't yeah and so i think that's led tended to lead to a decline in in families and family values especially oh yeah it has and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that you know we need to do something about but i don't know what i believe that too and i think uh the kids are where they need to you know they need to really focus on the children in the world in this yeah country yeah would would you have said that a couple of years ago do you think no i didn't i didn't even really think about it that much i mean you know i knew i was aware vaguely aware of it but um i didn't it wasn't really that important to me and uh uh-huh uh-huh it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child oh it it really does i just the whole uh you know seeing how you really are creating are are forming this you know the mind uh-huh well you know in the next year or so you'll see so many instances where you know he'll mimic something that you've done and you see you know everything i'm doing he's learning from that's right and and you think if i wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care yeah you know they that's how they're developing their patterns and i think a lot of people either don't care or don't realize it you know that's or or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide i yeah i've seen a lot of people just say well you know he'll learn everything when he gets into yeah eventually uh you know yeah it's true but it um i i know even just this first year that i've been with uh my son here here um he's i can just see how much of of a difference it makes staying home with him instead of uh yeah yeah plus plus i think it becomes part of you part of you too i mean you get to stay home i mean it's not just for him but it's also for you because you're both kind of bonding together there too i think so yeah that's true yeah well it's been nice talking to you well it's nice talking to you too okay good luck okay good bye okay bye bye  okay you want to get a start certainly um the weather here is warm and it's been sort of raining on and off uh-huh uh-huh and uh i'm an avid gardener so i measure measure measure the rain in our rain gauge on a on a regular basis so i can can avoid wasting money on watering oh great great uh-huh and uh but it's been threatening to rain for the last couple of days and it has not really which is a bit of a disappointment but it is very warm here which is typical for this part of the time of the year how about Pennsylvania um-hum yeah i think you're i think you're earlier than we are as a rule aren't you your your your summer growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours it starts in uh March as a rule uh-huh see that is quite a bit we are just beginning people are have got their gardens in a lot of them now we could still have a frost really this late could you have snow um-hum uh probably not but we have had we have had a frost as late as as in June oh well we don't have that problem early june so but we we have also had nice weather an unusually uh nice spring it is almost like an early summer for us oh well that is nice uh-huh we could use a little more rain i believe uh well we will be glad i will be glad to give you some of ours usually we get it in in great quantities in April and May uh um-hum um-hum and then it stops for three months yeah if it could just be spread out a little bit uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's really been nice here uh right we're supposed to have some rain this weekend but i don't know if we'll get it or not a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us the the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us just by well not too many miles um are you in an agricultural area yes um-hum we have well i know the weather i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of off of the land um-hum um-hum yeah we have quite a few farmers we we live out in the country we're on a farm but we're not a farming person uh we have a garden but uh but we're not farmers uh-huh uh-huh hum well you know there are some disadvantages to being down south and that is it gets so hot that you know a lot of things die during the summer from the heat um oh yeah they get burnt off they they really do and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered uh-huh uh-huh yeah well and that makes it bad too because uh when more with water being at a premium i know our aunt in California they they've really been rationed on their water and it makes it real hard to have a yard or uh or anything like that a garden their garden their farms their farmers i guess are hurting because of that also yeah well my parents are now in San Diego and and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't almost nobody there has has lawns yeah yeah well they are not allowed to water so what do you do yeah yeah uh it is very it is very rough on them so actually i think i think it is pretty moderate here in Dallas because the the summers are extremely hot uh-huh um-hum but your humidity is different though than ours i think and it makes a a bit of a difference too um what is your humidity humidity like oh i don't know i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in Texas i could be wrong uh i don't know what what it is percentage wise but i i don't know for sure either but it always seems well it just felt different like when we were in Texas it had a different feel to it yeah it's it's drier in Dallas than it is in Houston or San Antonio or even Austin which is further south but it is not dry and and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i don't know um um um-hum uh-huh well it could be i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times uh oh does he live near the lake well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that uh-huh um and uh he's just in an area where it is just low enough that it's you know it it collects there and uh he has had a couple of inches in his house several times um-hum that's that's a problem uh they tell you when you are looking for a house or or or buying land to build on to be very careful and check the drainage because uh it is it is deceptive um-hum um-hum um-hum because of that um-hum and uh i know exactly what you mean we are fortunate or uh we are on a where we are we get flooded it floods below us behind us but we're uh we are high enough that our house itself we never you know have had any problem like that uh-huh oh well that is fortunate yeah it is an old farm house and uh we really like it here um-hum well i i like it i like it here uh i i grew up here i have lived other places and and but i i did grow up here and this is very much home for me and uh-huh uh-huh it is nice down there i i i liked it when we visited there i hope you visited during the winter one of my one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter and you go to cold cool places that well i go to cool places during the summer if i can anyway right right that is the best time to go yeah and and usually it has been when we have gone it has been nice it has been hot but it is it is hot to me in the wintertime down there oh sure i mean you know but it is nice it's uh it's really a nice area i i had a friend from England visit once at Christmas and we couldn't get her out of the what she called the back garden because she wanted to go back with a sunburn and she went back to the north of England with a sunburn oh really oh oh good heavens not me i avoid the sun well yeah basically i do too yeah it takes me about four and a half hours to do to mow our grass and i try to cover up when i do the lawn well i that that is really healthier frankly yeah well i have had a little a couple of problems and uh i decided it is not worth it i i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier and uh we are just crazy um-hum that but you you know it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot now my sister is a a sun fiend and uh she is five years younger than me she is more wrinkled uh-huh is that right it it just makes your skin more leathery it uh it yeah so yeah and i think that's why exactly i think it burns off the i don't know the the the theory th e scientific principle but it burns something off the natural oils or something like that um-hum well the elasticity of your skin the collagen or whatever they call it they say it destroys a lot of that and you lose a lot of that so uh yes yes uh that sounds like a good that sounds like the right theory yeah but uh but we have really had nice the weather i can't complain we have really had really good weather of late and when it has rained it had it's been a good soaking rain and uh good it's just been a really nice Spring well that's great it's been it's been very nice here too and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening and i want them to have nice weather oh for their visit instead of driving around in the rain oh that's great how long will they be there uh probably four or five days uh-huh well that is great well i hope the weather stays real good for them and and uh that you have a good visit and everything and i hope your garden does good well thank you thanks yeah and the same to you and so okay well it was really nice talking to you and uh a pleasure good luck in your this venture it is uh like i said it has been real interesting so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it i'm sure i will in in fact if i hadn't been preparing for this the out of town visitors i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple of days yeah i forget to the day goes by and i forget to make a call usually well i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now i'll i'll start doing it okay well thanks Jean bye-bye great great okay uh bye-bye  okay um do you want to start do you have a well credit cards um i think think they are wonderful but um uh i think you have to have a lot of restraint um i have never been in trouble with credit cards but uh my youngest daughter is and a friend of mine is and i think it is terrible that they can uh you know wipe out a max in uh such a short time um-hum uh i never pay interest charges i value my money too much to uh line somebody else's pockets with my money um-hum and i always um pay it off before um i am charged any interest on my balance so you never let it run up on you never that is wonderful that is wonderful i am uh i i kind of uh uh i'm just do very you know just just all depends that it when i have everything all paid off and then i start wanting something and i don't really have enough well don't have enough in savings savings you know like for a big purchase um-hum then uh sometimes i i uh lose sight of it you know it's it just it is just is easy to use and then uh after a while i i am like you i hate paying those people interest and then i make um um-hum i make i i added like uh uh wrote uh an addition to to my car loan through the credit union which i knew was lower interest just to pay them all off and then i swore i would never use them again um-hum right you really have to show a lot of restraint but if you look at if you look at the time frame on that uh you will find that you have about six or seven weeks um-hum before you have to make that payment back to the credit card company without being charged any interest the only thing is you have to make sure that you don't charge more than you know you are going to be able to pay that's correct yeah you at a given time and um-hum your budget has to be so that you can uh you know summarize what your balance is going to be at a particular time and i can do that yeah and the problem the problem is especially with young people is they they want things now they don't want to have to wait for them and credit cards are the way to do that that's right and then then they're in trouble well that's what the you know that's what that's what it is geared for advertisement you know is uh to wet you appetite and give you that um-hum oh i've got to have that i can't live without that and that's the image that the younger generation has you know i have a i have a friend who uh well she is old enough to know better but uh she she did it and she got really in bad shape she ended up going into bankruptcy um-hum Palley Royal is her downfall and there is no limit on those things on that they just let you come and spend and you know run it up run it up so i don't know who was that that could Palley Palley Royal is that a department store uh-huh oh okay that's probably i i do not know if i don't know if it is local no it is not in uh in Dallas huh-uh no we we have Dillard's and uh Sanger Harris and Macy's and no Palley Royal Neiman Marcus and things like that and i am sure that they probably would not have a problem either i know i know a lot of people who uh some gals some ladies at work who don't have any problems with money or anything but they they really love Palley Royal so you know they it is just hard you know you got stay away or else you might end up you just can't help yourself and buy well self-control yeah self-control though is the key self-control is the key my daughter has my daughter is twenty and she got a Sears credit card when she was about eighteen um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh Christmas before last she and her boyfriend her boyfriend had gotten one too i believe and they gave some of the most wonderful gifts to everyone in their family i mean they spent lots of money on they gave each other these beautiful things they gave stuff to all of us and we were going um oh dear i can't believe you all did this you should not have done this and they got angry and said we wanted to do it um-hum um-hum okay now she is still paying on that Sears charge she has now you know she's learned and she she is uh definitely paying it off paying paying on it and not running it back up but you can't tell them wow sure well experience is the best teacher and sometimes you know uh a lot of us have have to learn by experience and and uh if you can learn by someone's else's past mistakes then you are very wise that's right if you can heed to advice given um-hum the only good thing one good thing about credit cards though uh especially in business if you uh you have to you know you are going to be reimbursed by your company that's true yes i am yeah um-hum and then uh in fact i know of a man who is in uh he is in a he he he he well he he is in an oil pipe pipe line selling kind of a thing and he has to he has to live on credit cards and then he gets commission you know later on but if he did not have credit cards he could not exist because a lot of those you know because he knows um-hum six weeks down the road he is probably you know he is going to get the money to pay for it but he really does so sometimes i think sure oh credit cards are you know really a blessing um-hum uh but you have to be wise when you use them that's true and uh i have nothing against them other than you know people abusing it and then they get themselves in hot water and you know they're just hurting theirselves and when you uh have a bankruptcy uh it takes you i think about eight years to wipe that off your record oh yeah yeah and so you know that is the shame about that is uh and people won't touch you and you've got to live that down um-hum that is true that's really true so you have to be very cautious about how you use your credit i mean it is a wonderful thing but don't abuse it right uh you know like emergencies or something that you do not have the ready cash that you do not have cash and you have to oh absolutely sure your car breaks down or you have to you have to have something um-hum sure it is a real it's you know you do not have the mo ney in savings so it really is a lifesaver at times when you do have to use it but but like you say use it wisely that's right only in you know when you really have to or knowing that you are going to pay it off every every month so that is that is something about American Express if you only use American Express you do not have a choice well there is a lot of people that uh know exactly what they are doing and they will run into tho usands and thousands of dollars into debt and they will deliberately do this so that they can go into bankruptcy and they they have a way of uh diverting all of the things that they've bought and put it like in hiding you're kidding no i have heard uh uh there was a radio program in Dallas that we listen to and i well it in fact it's nationwide and i was shocked at some of the stories that came out of that uh program about these people that really you know they bought all these wonderful things and then they went bankrupt and they were knowing they were going into bankruptcy and they knew that yes they knew that they were going to do that and they just um-hum so they it was planned and uh they said you know it was worth the uh jeopardizing their credit for that amount of time because they still had the stuff you know and they could write it off you know they can only um be responsible for a certain percent and not the full uh amount that they owed and i do not know who um determines uh the percentage rate that they have to repay but it is not surely what they are were indebted for oh no right um-hum so it it they use it as a scam instead of uh to me they were criminals and they used that that in a in a really bad situation yeah and that has kind of snowballed i guess around so i do not know maybe the courts and lawyers are working on that to cover you know cover all the loopholes that might exist but i've never been in that situation and hope i never have to be yeah me too really well i guess we covered it okay do you have any do you have anything else you want to add no i can't think of anything i am sure that we haven't covered everything because that is uh that is a great big uh a ball well if you have got any other thoughts uh credit throw them out i can't think of anything right now well listen thank you for calling and you have a good day well thank you Catherine bye bye-bye  okay what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time well uh i have two children so i don't have a whole lot of spare time right now one of the things that i've made time for is uh playing softball um-hum uh-huh i really enjoy i enjoy softball but i enjoy all kind of sports i enjoy watching and participating i really like water sports like swimming and skiing but i don't get to do that too often yeah and then i i really enjoy sewing but i don't get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing how about you oh i uh like sports type things too we like to get out and walk and we like the water sports too but like you it's unless you have a pool in your backyard it's kind of hard to get to do that uh-huh i know it it is do you work full time very often yeah well part-time we're going to have a baby in July so part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff lately but part-time oh right yeah that definitely takes over your time yeah it does i've been is this going to be your first yes uh-huh i've been doing some cross-stitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery so i haven't done that in years but i've kind of enjoyed that but it's just hard to find the time to sit there and do it and oh uh-huh yeah right well that's it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you've got something to show for it right yeah yeah that's neat and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby yeah i do too i just go out just to just to enjoy it and not really spend money sometimes just look yeah yeah well since i've had kids it's kind of funny i i never really was much of a garage sale shopper until i had kids but you'll probably find after your children get bigger uh like when they want things like tricycles toys things that cost quite a lot in the store you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars and yeah yeah we bought some baby clothes yeah last weekend at a garage sale yeah oh you can just get all kinds of things and kids especially clothes and toys they just don't use them and wear them you know for that many years or anything yeah so i'm i've become a garage sale shopper and it is fun on the weekends i drive around look to see you know who's selling what and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class and uh-huh oh just you know all kinds of things like that that you'd probably pay thirty dollars for and i got them for two dollars yeah so wow yeah yeah it kind of a hobby it that's time consuming too really to find the things you want sometimes you have to stop a lot of places yeah yeah it is it it does take more time but i don't work so uh that's something i've decided i'm going to make sure my kids have a have a happy growing up years and right yeah i think that's important too i'm not going to work after the baby comes yeah well that's good i'm glad so i guess hopefully i'll have time for more hobbies i do not know yeah well at first when you first have a baby you uh seems to take every moment of your time partly because you're not used to you know juggling your time around like that but right eventually the you'll you'll be doing lots of stuff so yes but i think my husband is real into sports too he plays on a TI softball team and a church softball team and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a a game a week we go to lots of softball wow yeah but the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with and we that's getting outside and you know doing things they like to do too so yeah so that's good a whole family your whole family can enjoy those hobbies yeah and one other thing we're doing this year is uh we bought Wet and Wild passes oh we've never done that before but the kids are always wanting to play in the water and uh like you said unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play it's kind of hard and uh they have real good kiddie areas uh at both of the Wet and Wilds around here so we're planning on going two or three times a week oh wow that'll make the summer go by in a hurry keep the kids busy yeah i think it will yeah because my oldest daughter's in school and she gets bored real fast when she's home with nothing to do right so i think that'll be a lot of fun yeah so we're looking forward to that yeah um do you consider yard work a hobby at all or is that just a chore well when i got married i thought it was going to be fun but my husband and i both i think consider it a chore it's our yard has had so many problems it's completely died out two times uh-huh yeah oh no and uh we've had to start all over trying to plant grass and so it's become a chore do you and your husband like to work in the yard oh well we like it once in a while but not as often as we have to do it i like to put flowers out and you know a few little things like that but as far as mowing every week and finding time to get all that stuff done it gets to be a chore yeah uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true seems like sometimes hobbies do that they kind of take over and turn into work instead of yeah well that's how sewing i love to sew and uh i wish i had more time to do it but sometimes i'll get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than fun yeah if it doesn't go crite quite right yeah another thing i enjoy doing is cooking i i like especially it's real strange but i like to cook for other people like i have a friend that's uh pregnant but she can't get up and walk around right now oh no so i enjoy you know cooking things to take over to her house or oh that's nice yeah it and it's fun for me to do that it's it's something i enjoy doing it's funny though it's like i don't really want to cook for us it's kind of like when you're a kid and and someone else's house was fun to clean but you didn't want to do your own yeah your how funny i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i'm not working when i don't get home until five thirty or six and i have to cook and clean up it's not it's not fun but i think i'll like it better yeah oh yeah yeah when you're home it's it makes a difference it sure does yeah well do you guys go camping or anything like that uh yeah we've done a little bit of camping we like that it's there again it's just so hard to find time to get away for a whole weekend um-hum yeah well that's something we're plan on doing not this weekend but the next my parents go camping a lot and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them and oh that sounds fun yeah we're really looking forward to it the girls love it they've been a couple of times and uh just getting to be outside you know all the time and sleep in a tent and that's really fun to them so yeah we're looking fo rward to that well that sounds nice i i think that'll be a good family thing yeah i think so to start doing more often if yeah my uh my husband loves to fish i'm not much into fishing but uh my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish so i think it'll be real good for them they can go fishing uh-huh yeah we've camped with some friends who have young children and uh if you can find some place where those little sunfish are right around the shore where they can just pull in a lot uh-huh uh-huh oh they have so much fun doing that and they think they're really great fishermen because they're catching so many yeah yeah yeah oh i know yeah um she's really looking forward i'm hoping that's another thing though when sometimes your uh hobbies can interfere with each other because my husband's afraid he's going to have a softball tournament that weekend and i'm saying no no yeah if you're doing a lot of things sometimes you have conflicts and you have to decide what you enjoy the most so oh yeah skip this tournament right yeah do you do any other crafts or anything besides just sewing well not really right now i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time uh i might take up there's i'd love to cross-stitch i think cross-stitching's so pretty but i have never done any it's not too hard it's i don't think it's as hard as like knitting or crochet or something like that yeah yeah yeah i i crocheted when i was younger it's funny when i was in high school i made a blanket and but you know i can't even remember how i did it now it's been so long since i did it but yeah yeah i started to sweater knit to knit a sweater and i got off on my rows somehow and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front and then i tore it out and threw it down and i i never have but uh-huh oh yeah picked it back up again and now i can't remember anything about it yeah well i did the same thing uh when i was pregnant with my first daughter i was really bored and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits oh uh-huh oh it was a real pretty rug and i thought well i could use this as a gift or something you know and oh it was so it's beautiful but i did not realize how long it took and i got about three two thirds of it done and then i just i had the baby and then it was just like i forgot all about it and every once in a while i'll be digging through the closet and i'll find that thing and i'll think oh maybe i ought to get the rest of that out you know and finish it yeah forget it yeah but uh for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big uh hobby it seemed like people did them a lot uh uh people don't do that much anymore so it was something easy i could do yeah i remember that yeah yeah yeah they are pretty easy yeah well it's been real good talking to you and i hope you enjoy your camping trip yeah you too oh thank you and thanks for calling bye-bye um-hum bye  okay well well what kind of music did you all listen to oh my goodness now see we think of classic rock that they you know have on all the easy listening stations now as our heart and soul i mean it was uh-huh that's a really good question because that was everything from the Rolling Stones to the Beatles i mean we were there no now well then you was in the uh or i am sorry i am going to make you sound like you're eighty something yeah i was well i was i was in seventh grade when the Beatles came out i fourteen years old Woodstock okay Woodstock what was yeah what was you doing during Woodstock well i wanted to go i was in Chicago and i guess i was close to eighteen or something i i it was like i think the summer between my uh high school and college somewhere around in there i can't quite remember the year and um um-hum you would have had a ball uh yeah i i kind of liked would have liked to have been there we couldn't we couldn't get it together to drive i mean you know we'd never driven outside of you know ten miles out of town at that time and here we were all hep to go to Woodstock you know yeah don't you wish you'd been able to though i really do you oh that would have been such a great memory it would have been incredible i i think of um you know all the social changes that were going on around that time yeah and and the sixties as being so revolutionary in a lot of ways in terms of raising people's consciousness everything from well i mean i remember we had the first Earth Day back then you know we got out of school at at uh the university and we celebrated Earth Day yeah you went and planted a tree or something yeah planted trees and stuff and we didn't realize you know the implications of all that then and a lot of the stuff that goes on today well well growing up with when i grew up it just wasn't we did not have any causes well to me it didn't doesn't seem like we've got much you know what i mean well you do you'll you i mean there was there was no name to it it was everything that was started in the sixties you had you had to fight for racial equality well i do remember demonstrations over busting and busting themselves it was like just a continuum you know everything sort of had a seed in the sixties and women's rights i mean things for women were totally different for you by that time yeah well right by the time i was born even now you know women's rights uh we just just assume we are totally equal now there is not really a lot to fight for now i saw something on TV last night on Twenty Twenty you know men uh fathers or daddies now wait a minute daddies are people too it is about a lot of men you know all right yeah going through divorces the judge will usually uh give custody to the mother ninety seven percent of the time because they go through the female and yeah well we learned that from Kramer versus Kramer didn't we yeah something like that but it does seem you know it seems unfair yeah it really does but it see men are coming into their own now too yeah they are well i thought about that i thought well now men you know have to fight to be equal and i think that's only right though really he one guy said the judge looked at him and said well now mister so and so he says i've have never seen uh calves follow a bull they always follow the heifer that is why i always he said that is why i always give custody to the mama and he said well he said does that mean you are going to shoot them if they break a leg and you know butcher them if they get fat he said my kids are not cattle yeah you know but that that is the way most people feel that women should get custody well are you married and do you have children yeah i am married and i've got two kids two kids and and how does your husband respond to all the new social um changes my husband is not a conformist at all he is still back there in the seventies well see bless his heart you know um well i mean he is still wearing bell bottoms jeans not bell bottoms but flared pants and and he well i do not like them but you know to him they're going to be back in style any day now yeah any day now well he just you know he is he is his own person he you know he does stay with it as far as music and stuff goes but he wears what clothes he wants to which we are both that way oh if something is out of style i don't really care if i like it i'm gonna wear it yeah but uh my husband is not a conformist at all oh well see that that's the spirit of the sixties and whether we are talking about the rain forests i tell you you know the situation you have right now and and all of our generations is what to do with the children because both uh-huh mother and father have to work now well uh we are trying to keep away from that my husband works for the railroad we have got it real tight but i've got a four month old baby and i do not want to work i want to tend to her i want to raise my kids oh okay that's that's see that is your commitment you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that you don't understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent um-hum well right well when he grew up he grew up with his we both grew up with single mothers ah and my mom had six kids uh-huh so she had to work and you know i was raised by my sisters and stuff and i can i can't see the difference but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us that one person that you could always count on being there right right and my husband was the same way and we just i want to raise my kids i do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them well i want to be there to make sure that well they need guidance and they do need parental guidance they definitely do twenty four hours a day they definitely do i do you stay home with yours uh well see i if i had some i would i i haven't i had an unfortunate thing happen and i'm you know and it is not going to happen that way but my my uh friends are having babies right and left so i get to see the different ways that they uh-huh they raise them um all raise them and and one gal she started a business in her home and she she hired an au pair which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house well but see now and the guy lives in with her you know i mean you know it is a family sort of unit sort of thing and the yeah okay sweetie let mommy talk and so well i think that's neat so that is a different way and then my other girlfriend just you know tears her hair out and goes at it you know twenty four hours a day watching both kids all the time and i think there is a point where you just have to get away right and it's good for the kid and it is good for you to develop you know your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time um-hum well i know the family is really going through changes but now we're trying to go back to about the sixties when the parents you know when the mother was staying at home yeah or that what do they call it the nuclear family yeah but uh yeah do you have any um do you have your mom or anybody around you that helps you um well my family is Kentucky now my my one of my sisters is down here her husband happened to get a job at TI they moved out here but well his family lives here and my husband was in the service when i met him yeah um-hum and so we we've been all over okay Kyle he sunburn in the kitchen so i keep having to scratch his back oh the uh i would love to get a business going out of my home outside of i mean going right yeah i'd would work at home if i could well that's well see and and that is uh the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home yeah that's the trend yeah they are bringing offices i mean just i mean big businesses into their homes bringing their computers home and working from there right and i think you know the more we try to you know shape that the more input we have into what that whole system is going to look like because that's that's our choice now too that's that's our cause well i think for i think one that would be uh it's uh kids could see their parents you know how hard they work yeah they would understand more when uh we first moved down here i was working i was working a twelve hour shift it was three and four days a week um-hum and uh oh my little boy just oh he went wild you know i mean because because he had been used to me being there all the time yeah being there all the time yeah and he's just now well when i got pregnant i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home and it was costing too much at home than more at home than i was bringing in so yeah see the the the economic situation on the whole thing and then uh well it's see we do have things that we're concerned about here this generation i don't know uh-huh social change is always going to go on but i think we have taken a big leap in the last you know twenty thirty years and um nothing is the same no it seems like it's totally different of course i do not have much to compare it to to me our causes don't seem as important as you all's were do you know what i mean well yeah but we we grew we passed them on to you you know i mean i said we passed them on to you i mean you know because it takes a lot of hard work it takes writing letters to congressmen and you you what we passed them on to us and you know just being very very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future and and u you know um did we make the right choices we do not know we will never know no i mean you know i i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today yeah i think we made some big wrong choices and i think business got in the way i think the greed of the eighties got okay yeah  okay have you ever uh organized a family reunion uh no i never organized one but we're we have one uh we're going to have one on Memorial Day i guess they've had one the last two years uh-huh we go out to the my dad's farm and uh and you know it is just a picnic and spend the night um-hum go fishing and stuff like that how many people usually show up oh about ten oh it is not that big huh-uh because it um we've had sort of weekends like that too but i never thought of it really as a reunion um-hum i sort of think of a reunion with my uh all the extended family everybody yeah yeah that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California and some is in New York and North Carolina and it gets uh-huh kind of hard to get everybody get everybody organized uh is there someone do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there or uh yes yeah my my uh dad has a house out there anyway and there is there is uh he keep us uh food down there year-round so um-hum so he doesn't live there though uh no it's it's it's like a country country home vacation home um-hum yeah it sounds nice um are there kids that are there too or mostly adults yeah the grandchildren uh-huh just a few it just depends uh uh uh all my grandparents are dead so uh there is there are not you know none of them are there and and uh then an uncle is dead so um-hum the the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be um-hum are you all located in Texas uh yeah we're in we are all uh like they live up in Sherman it is near Lake Texoma um-hum but and uh all of his children live in the Dallas area too so yeah do it that to me is you know Dallas i know of Houston i know of and that is about it uh-huh in Texas the rest of it is sort of a big void to me yeah but uh you know we have uh well we all got together it was about two years ago for i was i'd graduated from college and um i was going to live in France for a year and so my parents invited it wasn't just family it was friends too but um we all got together for just a party and that was kind of fun uh-huh nice to have everybody be together at once and things like that French reunion well yeah not quite French but uh it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um New Year's Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time um-hum that was kind of fun but um who was it a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend and it really sounded like it was fun but i am not quite sure what i would do i think it'd be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know um-hum and have different areas to explore and things like that so that'd be kind of fun yeah meet in the middle yep um-hum where nobody lives right but at least that way it is at nobody's house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything yeah and they don't have to clean up afterwards yeah yep that's for sure the cleaning up can be a mess um-hum but um do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm i'm i'm sorry does your does your dad have horses there uh no he doesn't really have any any uh uh domestic livestock anyway uh-huh the he leased uh to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on i see so it's so he really does use it as a vacation home it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that yeah pretty much he has a garden and uh a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things um-hum well that sounds nice do people actually pick the fruit and things um-hum and then there is wild blackberries there too um-hum so he gets yeah i used we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friend's property but we never got enough i used to make jam but i never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something huh so it wasn't so worth it yeah it is kind of they're kind of off and on it seems like um-hum depends on the rain that sounds is does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there um it is uh it is uh eighty acres well that is pretty big uh-huh i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a huge amount of land yeah yeah yeah because the person's house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres as opposed to tens of acres yeah and and uh and most of it you know you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it um-hum and uh because that's where the ponds are and where everybody fishes um-hum we kind of have a an infor mal contest my uncle uh put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago well he put some crappie too but the bass we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet so uh-huh they're in there but they're real spooky yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation ho me too and yeah i mean really little and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in and there were too many little goldfish and so the big ones never got bigger uh-huh oh yeah and uh somebody suggested to get a bass um-hum and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again never saw the bass no so we do not know if it is living or oh oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish yep yeah we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish yeah they really do this yeah because we started we have got hundreds in there now and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know many no matter how many it was for a dollar um-hum and and some of them are probably eight inches long but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long oh yeah and they have there's a uh it you might put some like some yellow catfish in there i do not know if they'd live very well up in New York but they get huge and uh they routinely use them for bait for uh goldfish for bait for yellow catfish oh okay well we we'd want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think um-hum yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada um-hum so that you mean well we could try it that is a good idea um-hum he's he was trying to catch them you know using little uh i forget there's little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that minnow nets or something my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish and it was really funny because uh um-hum uh one time he left the net in the pond and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish uh-huh and uh he left it in the middle of the pond and that night he came out and the trap was gone and it was a raccoon that had taken it right so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that um-hum and so yeah that's what happens but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there yeah and uh we feed the catfish they feed the catfish like uh uh every couple of weeks and uh and sometimes that's the best time to catch them when they're feeding yeah because they'll just they will just come after anything then uh-huh and you could catch a couple anyway during that time what do you feed them uh mixed Purina uh it is uh cat food uh catfish food really yeah but i mean it's especially made for catfish yeah well i do not know how much different it is from dog food but you know it's um it looks like Purina High Pro uh-huh that's funny but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water and um-hum and they're the catfish the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water uh-huh i have never seen catfish you know except in filleted filleted on a plate i think maybe i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum um-hum but i've never seen them just alive someplace that would be fun to see well they are really funny fish when you catch them they make a kind of a a burping growling sound at you um-hum uh-huh and they try to hit you with their tails how big do they get oh well the channel catfish get up to uh i think the world record is fifty something pounds okay but how long in feet um that that is only about three and a half feet long do you know that's pretty big though yeah they get real fat yeah uh-huh um from the time they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out um-hum uh my daughter we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing and i think that was when she was three and she caught a catfish by accident she was fishing for sunfish and she said here and she handed me her rod and reel uh-huh and and uh you know it it was just pulling drag out um-hum and it swimmed wherever it wanted to yeah that sounds amazing i'll have to see them sometime but all righty okay it was nice talking to you nice talking to you too uh enjoy your uh weekend okay bye-bye yeah have a nice Memorial weekend okay you too bye-bye  well i guess it depends on what age i'm in the thirty something so i know i mean i lived through it uh are you old enough to know about the war um just barely yeah i'm uh twenty nine so uh oh okay well yeah you're old enough but it was on the fringe yes but just uh yeah exactly had some friends over that were that were in it it ended when i was in uh college in uh when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy i can't even remember at this point um when i turned nineteen it was the year that uh the draft was still going on if i had been a male or in Israel i'd have been number two really yeah so i learned a lesson in gender um in terms of the war i don't know um wowie uh-huh see actually i don't really know that much about it i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media you know um i guess i think it was not that great that we were in there um in terms of for how long it lasted right you know what do you think um-hum well i think it's uh basically the same way it's certainly has affected uh US policy though there's no question it had an overwhelming effect of how we approached the the thing in uh Iraq um-hum um-hum because uh the whole thing that was bad about Vietnam was no different from Iraq i mean it was uh one country picking on a smaller weaker one right the devastation yeah yeah the only difference was that the government said okay if we're going to support this smaller country then we're going to support it a hundred percent and we're going to consider ourselves against in war against these people as well um-hum yeah and in full faction yeah which uh right which really wasn't the attitude with Vietnam it was sort of a president's war rather than a country's war yeah it just kind of dragged on um i don't know how you were historically but i was was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since LBJ and i mean i had yeah right yeah it seemed to me like it was it seemed like it was going on forever yeah it really well yeah in fact because in terms of when your there's at least ten years between us so in terms of when you were in school i'm sure that it was you know the majority of your high school and junior high years um um-hum one of the things i didn't like was the weapon the weapons i can't even say it the weaponry that systems that they used um it just didn't seem that um yeah i don't know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you'd think right you know just uh how could the government or the Pentagon uh whomever whomever's in charge there been so careless yeah right um of course now uh now everyone's more uh you know environmentally uh intelligent than they were back then i mean back then it wasn't commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things that people conscious yeah Nutrisweet yeah and all these other things that's true uh that people know about themselves now um monetarily too i just don't think we've done enough for the uh Vietnamese people as a whole um in South Vietnam in general in helping them restore themselves um-hum you know and i don't know if it's because there aren't any oil fields there yeah i don't know if they uh i don't know if they have that resource or not yeah i mean i don't think they do but i just think it's kind of a shame that uh you still hear things about the children that are orphans there and um so on a whole i don't know war isn't good and that one i probably um yeah my main opinion would be we shouldn't have done it right well that's what i know about the Vietnam War unless you have yeah yeah well you know a little uh a little bit more than i do explain it said i didn't uh get to live through it that the people that i know that it did um-hum uh felt very strongly most of i work for a government contractor so most of the guys i work with are uh well at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans um-hum um-hum oh Vietnam and uh from Vietnam and i haven't talked to any of them that that weren't you know glad that they went or or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one jeez yeah um-hum and that that you know most of them are very very strongly that that the reason for America to be there was a good one they just felt that the way America backed them up wasn't wasn't at all right uh-huh in terms of the personal yeah the bitterness is more on a personal level than on a yeah in term of yeah personal level and and the finances how they started you know like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy because the Congress wouldn't approve you know yeah uh-huh the money's after yeah i mean i think it started actually like like in the late fifties i mean like in fifty eight fifty nine um i i so it really i mean because i know in nineteen sixty three i mean i was nine years old when Kennedy was shot um-hum so i mean i remember um right around then that that's when i first started hearing about Vietnam but then as i got older and studied in school i realized it was even going on before that yeah you know and you think to yourself oh my goodness Eisenhower that sounds ancient yeah and i know i know you know a lot of the Vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties um guys that i know that yeah right they're just kind of bitter you know they they you know i hate to quote that movie Born on the Fourth of July but it's that kind of idea uh-huh you know they just don't feel that socially they were given like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome yeah they weren't given the yeah so right right the ticker tape parade and all that well i won't keep you anymore that's probably about as much as we both but thanks for talking to me ah yes is that where you're at okay yes uh were you calling from Texas no i'm in Falls Church Virginia oh i know where that is that's beautiful where you're at yeah right right near DC DC yeah are you a native of there ah pretty much yep been yeah uh Dallas it is uh ninety two degrees here today but at least the humidity is uh below forty percent which makes it kind of like Phoenix yeah it's about the same weather here little bit little bit cooler like eighty nine but basically the same thing really well you yeah well you're not missing too much then yeah right really well take it easy okay bye-bye okay bye-bye  well i i been uh i've probably had more time than you have to think about this subject so i'll tell you is is it a serious problem yes i do believe it's a serious problem however there are solutions to it um-hum yeah um-hum um-hum and foremost uh where we compare we that we are now doing fifty percent of our uh people are voting uh we're probably making a comparison against uh some European and uh and uh uh say newer republics that uh that have very high percentages um-hum um-hum uh so uh one of the reasons that that uh one one of the reasons that we could get uh one of the reasons that it is lower in the United States is that mostly we hold it on Tuesdays God knows why we hold it on Tuesdays and then we further complicate it by saying you know we'll keep the polls open until eight o'clock what right most people uh a great number of people now work at various at different jobs that if a third of the people are shift workers they won't be able to get to the to the polls in any case if they uh have to work late into the evening and not get up right my solution to that is that we hold it on Sundays as do probably sixty to seventy percent of the European countries now oh really they hold it on the weekends they hold it on the week no they hold it on a either a Saturday or a Sunday or at least a day when when uh a great number of people aren't working in in America that's not true because a a great number of people work on Sundays Sunday uh-huh huh well uh but but that's one of my solutions so i i know here in Dallas that they've just instituted in the last couple of years a um a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections and they i don't think they've seen a really high improvement have you absentee voted in in in Texas well i have absentee voted in uh New Hampshire and it's a fairly fairly complicated process where you have to go pick up the ballot no no i always vote oh really i don't say it's that complicated but part of the process also is that you must register preregister at some particular point New Hampshire is fairly easy but other states you have to register every couple of years and uh hum to absentee vote specifically well to vote to vote to just vote so registrations are perhaps a a problem also and we're the mobile mobile society uh people are always mobile you know one out of every seven people moves every year oh um-hum uh that's almost a fourteen percent turnover every you know if you compound that that uh if it is difficult to register to vote that would remove your eligibility to vote um-hum but i don't think it's difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place who or who are not just motivated who really believe that their they well their voice is heard i mean and the people that i've talked to well maybe that's another factor the motivational factor the motivational factor is probably i right i think that is the biggest one that's the biggest problem i well that's diminished by we we've noticed this in particular i i'm just read two books one of them is Whose Stars and Stripes Now um-hum the uh trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eighty eight it's a fairly decent book i mean it's uh oh really hum it's preceded by uh several other books by these guys uh Wake Me Up When It's Over was about the eighty four elections and i forget what the other books were but any case uh it it it's uh uh the uh uh there was the Blue Smoke and Mirrors was the one in eighty two uh they these guys uh have taken the place of Theodore White on reporting elections in any case they say that uh there's a definite trend uh well you know toward candidates using negative voting it's the only way that you can use television effectively i don't understand that why do uh is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public and the public's um gullibility no the public would rather hear something negative about the other guy than uh than than a positive factor and you and you know to if you if you go on the attack and and put some sensational thing before the public as Mike Dukakis learned in the last campaign and it's not refuted people will you know uh believe it if you don't refute it as he didn't that that there must be some truth to the matter see well he did refute it he he refuted it just wasn't effective enough to well he didn't refute it until the last two weeks of the campaign he didn't believe anybody would believe that and indeed his trend started upward well that see i i didn't believe anybody would believe that either i i i guess i have i have a hard time coming to terms with the the fact that the American public really well they do was you know so well don't give too much credit to the American public for their motivational ability and and and it well then how can a democracy work then how how can it work well it uh well i don't know is it working i mean that's that's the question i guess the question also is that we discovered is that they don't throw rascals out everybody seems disappointed but they don't throw the rascal out their own rascal right right uh my my solution to to part of this is is to to make it an economic economic incentive for people to vote that sounds rather crass i think because then then you're saying well uh what you know you it could be convoluted convoluted in many ways where people would actually uh by paying them i mean you know you take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever huh but that it would be very difficult to administer because i'm sure that any time money and votes are involved it just the whole thing just stinks well how about how about the reverse of that when i've heard about England's elections they are allowed to run for what a total of six or eight weeks even for the higher offices in the in the land what if we totally took money out of the campaign made just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue i feel like if if we did that people would have a lot higher confidence that their vote was counting rather than their contributions would count yeah but the idea is to get the individual to the polls and and and we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls i don't think i don't care how easy it is for them i don't think they're going to because they don't think that their that anybody listens to their vote they think whoever has the bucks they really think that the packs you know no matter what you're promised during a campaign and these days we're promised hardly anything of substance right oh you mean the special interest groups and uh and uh yeah no matter what a uh candidate promises during the campaign which isn't very much specific any that they don't promise anything specific these days but whatever you're promised they just they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office i mean i think that's the well read my lips and and and no new taxes and yet Bush did that but i mean but but he's excused from that generally people i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a a definite necessity to balance the budget yeah yeah well then why did he say that during his campaign then he should it was totally oh he he he gave it that he he did he did he promised the best he could and he's the president and he should he should address those problems and if there needs to be a change in a period of time why what was so funny about it is that i guess that it happened so rapidly you know he knew it he actually knew it and being associated with government he should be held up to the light for that and maybe he will yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah well but i think it's uh i mean i think you you still have a view that the American voter is different from other voters and he's motivated because we happ en to be the cradle of liberty and all that i think voters are motivated uh what about what about voters in the other countries that you're talking about like in the European countries where they have higher turnouts and well the newer democracies because it's going to be totally different but well i don't know if they have higher turnouts overall i don't think England has i think England has about a seventy percent sixty five percent turn out you don't think so uh-huh i think that we just discovered in this in in the Indian elections is one of the greatest and massive things in the in the world oh uh just it was got violent more violent every year they went down to almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up Gandhi but right oh really simply because people were so concerned about yeah their inability that to that their vote doesn't count anyway hum and the corruption of politics in in in that situation but then but you know everything is relative to when uh you know we had higher turnouts because at that time we talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter right yeah i mean is but but before these enormous before this Voting Rights Act what we had was a a great deal of our population uh mainly the Blacks in the South and the Hispanics were precluded by um-hum oh by uh voting laws uh from registering from their eligibility to register now everybody's available oh so if you really computed it they probably when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty we really only had a fifty percent turnout because all the eligible voters oh i see because right weren't qualified disqualified were disqualified you know the it was skewed by the eligible voters being less than the total population of but isn't that isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the Blacks and Hispanics and other minorities just don't vote or is that just the the truth no i think the high there's a higher percentage in in certain Black areas of voters i don't know about Hispanics you know yeah i just i i mean i haven't studied the statistics well enough to i mean i think in this sort of a well conversation we can only do our own reactions right right but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in Dallas last year they have this huge fight going over redistricting here and at one point they did they took another vote on it um-hum and they uh the minorities could not get enough of a vote out to to pass their plan and this is something that had been going on for months it was on the news every night they and they have had lawsuits over it i mean it was it was a major issue and there still wasn't enough minority vote to get to pass the plan that they were backing so that's you you know i think that you have really hit on something there to say that uh those what do you mean well with the minorities and we're saying we have low voter turnout maybe it is is uh now that we have minorities included in the you know Karen i wonder if we are recording why did you not press one i did press one but usually by this time they tell me that the time is up  yes what what major changes have affected your life well i think that uh women women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now um you mean yourself or women in general well women in general and and also myself but um um-hum it used to not really really make a difference to me um or at least i didn't think so but my mother worked and i kind of now wish that that she hadn't that uh uh-huh that she had um stayed home and right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children but i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home so i'm having to uh try to figure out a way to be able to do that uh-huh and in in our society right now that's really something that's that's um not respected and it's not it's not um it's it's not easy to do at all i mean there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the if the wife is going to actually be a mother uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that's interesting because that relates to the thing that that strikes me the most and i'm sure you've you've labeled the cause because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave um-hum i think that that they're well they have to be related and that's right that's right and you know i mean i was thinking it just you know my complaint would would be um that i think that you know the kids in the neighborhood run wild and they they destroy property and they you know steal each other's toys and stuff and there's just no respect for for people or property um-hum and i guess you know when you stop to think of it these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives um-hum i think that that's probably true oh scary i just wish there was a way i know that in in you know in Sweden what they have there it's really their medical plan but it also deals with this subject because if a woman um is working and i think even if she's not and has a child the government subsidizes her to stay home and raise the child uh but for how many years i don't i don't know until it and um i'm sure until at least school age and maybe longer and what this does is um-hum oh that's great it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care um-hum to raise the child for her right and i think that that's a real a much much more viable solution really um-hum no i agree a hundred percent a hundred percent i guess i was lucky because i was teaching and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little and so i'd be gone you know an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch oh yeah that's great and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that so that's an interesting issue though um-hum um yeah um goodness what else oh there's been so many how do you just you know right i've actually another one that i a question i would have is i guess i'm being you know beyond the age of thinking of this this problem i had an argument recently with my boss i think it was about the need for women to work but i think you put your finger on it when you said that they're not respected if they don't work because it seems to me that a lot of people i know women i know are doing very uh menial jobs in a certain sense certainly financially um-hum and i mean when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home yeah um-hum i'm sure that they're not making quote making money for the family on this yeah really and and probably you're right i don't see how they could be especially not if they have to pay for child care well no even families that don't have child care i mean you know when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year and i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes plus you know fast food every day and out to lunch every day um-hum you're probably right if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like God what am i doing this for you know and exactly and i mean you know even though they don't have children they they have relatives and you know the husband would certainly like a lot more attention and and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house and um-hum do the gardening and so i i guess you're right it's it's our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected um-hum really sad yeah religion has changed too oh that's true um uh uh some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for instead of just um it it's it some places still it seems like it's a social club um-hum you know it's just a place to go to visit uh to wear your nice clothes and and to sit around and talk but um i think a lot of people are really you know searching now to find find out you know who they are and who God is and what all that really means now um-hum so that might be of a positive change in society yeah well it's it's um it's beginning i think um-hum um-hum i guess i haven't seen that as much in this area although every now and then you hear about it um-hum um but among you know people i know i don't see a great you know there are those people who have have had serious questions all along and you know are sort of pursuing it but um-hum um the churches here are growing leaps and bounds and i thought it was more because of the the very transient nature of the area and that people were going basically just as you said as a social to meet people and that um-hum but um it's hard to judge there are a lot of things changing i suppose yeah just you know the whole the whole environment i find um-hum um sort of you know i wonder with with all our chemicals and and that and and the foods we eat and you know young people that i know are getting very serious diseases and oh yes well i guess that's always happened maybe not as much as now but you probably well it's just it's maybe it's more unusual now when you know somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer and in the past maybe the same percentage got them but we didn't know it or i don't know well i guess we've sort of run dry a little bit it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye okay nice to talk to you bye-bye  okay Catharine can you uh give me your views on uh what you think about the uh care of elderly well i would i hate to see them being put into a hair care or a health facility care environment because they then feel like you know the family has abandoned them is uh what i get the comments from elderly people that i know that it's happened to and the elderly people that i that are still hanging onto their homes that is their greatest fear is to be put into a a a care facility rather than their families taking them in because the families then seem to neglect visiting them but if that is the case that they have to go to a care facility like that i think that care facility has to be thoroughly investigated as far as the uh medical um evaluation what kind of credentials do the medical people hold uh if they're qualified uh what type of recreation do they have for them uh their food uh situation um the environment that they are exposed to the the majority of the time that they're there is it bright and cheery um and to put them in with people that have the same type of uh lifestyle uh that they would feel more more welcome in uh in making new friends because they can relate to certain individuals because of their personalities um yeah um so i guess i would like to hear how you feel about it now Ray uh we uh just went through an experience um both my parents passed away fairly young and uh oh my my wife's mother died when she was only nine years old so the only one that we really had was her father and uh i i see he's no longer with us he passed away when he was uh he was going on eighty nine years old so he had a good long life yes he did uh-huh but he always maintained his own apartment he lived in the city he lived in uh Rhode Island in fact we live in Rhode Island i work in in the Massachusetts plant but i live in Rhode Island um-hum he's always lived in the in the city and he's always been kind of independent he's uh that's wonderful that's good he's never had a a never owned an automobile never had a driver's license you know he's always you know yeah so he was very independent wasn't he he got around yeah yeah because he lived right down down city in the yes port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to New York and you know i mean he went wow that's wonderful yeah he went everywhere he wanted to go sure he it didn't have any hindrances for him no and then about a year and a half ago he uh he started having mini strokes um-hum and we got kind of concerned about him and then uh he had fallen in the street a couple of times but oh bless his heart he uh he still didn't want to give up his apartment um-hum um-hum and uh and uh finally a year ago last Thanksgiving um my wife tried to call him and he wouldn't answer the phone so we kind of expected the worse so i went down um-hum and he had had another stroke and uh i found him he was just he was just standing in the middle of the room all covered with shaving cream he always trying to shave and he didn't know who i was so we brought him up to to uh stay with us um-hum and uh he snapped he snapped out of it he uh he was probably uh say ninety five percent himself um-hum um-hum and in in the course of the next during the next year towards again it was getting on towards Thanksgiving time he started having you know more strokes and then uh that's wonderful um-hum uh one morning he felt real dizzy so we took him to the hospital um-hum and while he was in the hospital he had a a massive stroke and it crippled him on one side his right side um-hum um-hum so he didn't have the use of of his arm or his leg or and then uh he lost the ability to speak and we're not sure but we think that he was very hard of hearing to begin with his almost his whole entire life i see so we figured that uh his hearing deteriorated even further and his eyesight um we did as much as we could for him and then it got to the point where we couldn't handle him anymore sure i understand that um i was working during the day and and uh my wife couldn't she she couldn't get him up um-hum sure so um the alternative was to put him back in the hospital which we did and they took care of him you know and he slowly deteriorated and uh um-hum to the point where he uh became fairly stable i mean he he knew who we were when we went in to visit him even though he couldn't communicate with us um-hum and then they said that um there was nothing more that they could do for him and he had to go into a nursing home the doctor said that he couldn't come back with us um-hum because we couldn't take care of him right and we started looking around and they said no the first nursing home that's closest to you that has an available bed is where he's going to go so we didn't have much of a choice wow i didn't know that they were that uh well at least up here um so he went in there anyhow and my wife went in there every day to see him and you know she were you satisfied with uh the facility uh at first well at first no um-hum it's uh it's very cold uh or at least we thought it was they're very clinical they're it's like a well it's a business um-hum right you get them in uh you do what you have to do for them and that's it oh um so I would go on weekends and she would go during the day to to visit him and they had a laundry you know they had the whole facility was there but um um-hum closed up most of the time so she'd go in and do his laundry for him and she'd go in and feed him and and it got to the point where um they we knew them just as much as they knew us and and they really cared for him at you know he was in there for almost six months so you established a relationship with the uh the personnel there um-hum um-hum with the nursing home right um and it was run the nursing home was run by uh regular staff but it was owned by Seventh Day Adventists okay which was a surprise to us you know we didn't realize that they had i guess well then you did see some compassion from the people there uh but most of the people were or were they just very businesslike and perhaps not of that faith well they didn't have anything to do with it they owned it okay but they i suppose they cared how it was run but they had an administrator that ran it and and most of the people were um uh aliens you know uh Jamaicans or Africans or okay um-hum um okay yes and they uh they took real good care of him he had lost a pair of slippers one day and one of them out of her own money bought a pair of slippers for him and you know that type of thing i see uh-huh but i think only because my wife spent so much time there she was there i mean every single day during the week and then on weekends we would go in the both of us uh-huh uh-huh um-hum and she would do things and she would donate little things and she'd help clean up the tables and you know that type of thing so um um-hum right but you're right when most when most people end up in there and i hear it from a lot of elderly people their greatest fear is that they're going to end up there and nobody's going to see them sure that's right they'll be abused but you hear horror stories all the time oh yes sure but if you care then it makes a difference those people oh absolutely absolutely that have uh a a lot of visitors um-hum and we had a gentleman that uh that uh let's see maybe about a week after my father-in-law was in there he shared his room he came in he could get around fairly well he again had a had a stroke and he was partially paralyzed um-hum um-hum but he was young enough where they gave him therapy and he was beginning to move up but he could talk and would tell us things oh you want to see what they're doing here and do you want to see this but don't tell anybody you know so he kind yeah yeah so he kind of adopted you and your wife yeah yeah in fact uh uh-huh um-hum we go down to see him she goes down occasionally maybe maybe uh once or twice a week just just to see him um-hum and uh i'll stop in maybe once or once or twice a month on the weekend i'll go down to see him well i'm sure he looks forward to that uh yes but he gets out he can get out you know he can he's got a lot of friends and they take him here and they take him there so he's not as as bad off as some of the people because some of them are in there and in the six months that my father-in-law was in there um-hum um-hum um i've i've seen a lot of them that didn't have any visitors whatsoever at least while i was there right yeah they're abandoned by their families yeah or if they or they might not have any at all yeah they just uh yeah and uh we had an old dog an old shepherd they were inseparable my father-in-law and the dog we brought the dog down there and it was nice and all the old people oh look at the dog and um-hum um-hum um-hum oh yes well most people don't do that you know they don't they don't they figure figure once you're in there you forget everything and that's that's really not the case and it's it's sad um um-hum um-hum um i hope that i never get into that situation where you know the kids will say well okay dad you know here you go of course yes um-hum um-hum um-hum i think i'll walk off into the mountains somewhere or out into the like the old Indian people used to do but yeah yeah and you know and there's something to say for that i think well yes they died with dignity didn't they right they do and and the people that um-hum that have families that don't  are you a Vietnam veteran Dudley uh no no do you have family who were in the Vietnam War uh no my father was uh came in right after world war two okay so he was too old and you're too young right yeah all right do you know some folks who have been there i am too young yeah um yes a couple okay okay how did it influence them uh the the one guy i worked with down in Austin hated it uh he was a lineman down there and while he was there he caught some kind of a strange disease um-hum um-hum and uh all his hair fell out and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while and um-hum uh what about long lasting effects on him has he still suffering from those problems i do not think he was in combat so um-hum well i've talked with a number of Vietnam veterans and i really i had no one directly related to me involved um-hum but uh my sister's husband was in Vietnam and it it really made a completely different man out of him he went to Vietnam one man and came back another not better um-hum yeah then uh another friend of mine went and he was in combat but he came back and he said okay that's it that is behind me i am going on with my life much like what Roger Staubach did right he was uh he was a Vietnam war veteran and uh yeah but he was in the Navy though he was it makes a lot of difference yeah that's true right and but uh most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land or in combat are still still carry a lot of anger um-hum they really do and uh i i i i really do not think that we did those young men right i think that uh Desert Storm shows a lot of learning since that time oh yeah uh well the armed forces did so much to you know Agent Orange they did so much to their own people all during that time you know and they take they take a even now uh they take a free hand as far as medicine and yeah that's true yeah uh you know how they treat the war casualties you know if you come back and your leg's blown off you know or or it is hanging by a thread they still can't put it back together now but um-hum um-hum uh-huh but what they do afterwards and how they rehabilitate rehabilitate you well you know one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast Asians into this country since that conflict uh not so much that i say i do not want you here but there is just such a surge um-hum yeah of southeast Asians it has affected the culture of this country uh very much oh yeah it's about it's about nine or ten percent now yeah yeah yeah well uh the culture's changing look how much more oriental food we have restaurants now for example um-hum uh even ten years ago there weren't that many a lot of shops are are operated by uh southeast Asians um-hum a lot of people have complained in the schools there is a culture change there the southeast Asians seem to be very hungry there seem to be very studious and uh tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them which is not bad not really uh but it might in the long run you can see where yeah scholarships for example uh even jobs um-hum uh jobs that would normally go to an American with a lesser education might be going to to some of these people here and that is all a result of of of Vietnam and and you see a lot of a lot of men that were over there brought families back yeah that's uh and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there and i'd be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now um-hum well they are probably not doing very well at all because i know there's there's still people even in the Dallas area there are there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from uh Vietnam i know that they're you are talking about POW's or missing in actions um uh native native Vietnamese people native Vietnamese people okay yeah they were lost you know when they were little and and they could never did get back oh i hadn't that that hadn't occurred to me yeah that'd be an interesting concept and uh and uh that's is really a big waste because they didn't they didn't win they didn't regain any of the land that they had it spilled over into uh now i can't even think of the country but Cambodia yeah Cambodia and to Laos and um-hum um-hum and all they did is run and hide and they weren't really fighting you know it it would've been the same as Desert Storm if all they had been fighting was North Vietnam um-hum um-hum but and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was China or Russia you know they were pouring they were pouring weapons in there and um-hum and advising well digging tunnels for them you know and there is no way that they could ever catch them um-hum well i think the terrain had a lot to do with the the success of Desert Storm as opposed to that in Vietnam yeah that is right you know there is incredible cover in Vietnam and you can't find much cover on in a sand dune um-hum yeah yeah and all they can do is dig in and they you know and then they try to camouflage the top that's right um-hum um-hum well now even i think even now in in Vietnam they could probably have done a better job because they could they could kill all those plants you know which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on but and the and the Corps of Engineers i think do a better job now like they did in Desert Storm well because they had he he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went and they had to you know they had to blow them up or um-hum um-hum or disarm them and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he where he'd made those moats um-hum what war do you think they found the experience for that uh don't you think they learned from the mistakes in Vietnam well yeah partially uh-huh yeah part of it is technology yeah because all go ahead part of it's that part of it's technology but but when when when you get into trouble like that in a place like Vietnam you do tend to analyze the problems that you get into and you sa y never more and and you overcome those problems and you are prepared next time yeah i think that's one of the reasons that they've they've pretty much avoided getting involved in South America because um-hum look what happened when they were looking for Noriega and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him you know he probably just went down into a tunnel right um-hum sure sure sure well i know that from a personal standpoint people was one of the finest assets that we lost we didn't actually physically lose them they did not lose their lives but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had yeah that is right uh being entirely different people i had dinner Monday night with a Vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had um-hum that's a long time to suffer yeah and they they really need everybody that's that's stood there it's when in in Vietnam i think it was much closer contact you stand there with a rifle and blow a a piece of somebody apart um-hum or blow their head off and that has to affect you if you are human you know so they had to work all that that anger out and the and the nightmares that come along with it um-hum oh yeah yeah i can't uh oh yeah you bet you bet i don't i do not really think that anybody can ever forget forget that but they can they can reason and and try to adjust to to why they were there um-hum yeah well you see that's what the veterans are so angry about now they say well we're going to listen to this and we're going to look at this find out what our mistakes were and we're not gonna make them again but that doesn't undo the ones that were done and that's what makes the veterans angry right and i can't blame them i don't know a solution um-hum but i sure can't blame them for being angry on the other hand you know you can be angry about something for a very long time or you can say well that is the way it is and go on with your life right uh for the most part i wish that it hadn't happened but it did so yeah and that and that was that was in the in the era when Kennedy was president that they were afraid of everything you know and and and they fought initially got into it because of Eisenhower that's right and he just he didn't want to be in it any more than than what we started out in August with Desert Storm and then it just blew up into the war oh yeah well it has been that way for a very very long time though i can remember when i was in the sixth grade and that was many years ago we were reading about the French struggling with that in southeast Asia French yeah um-hum so and and and the Asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on there there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world right um-hum i really i don't know it we should not have maybe gotten involved but if we did we certainly should have supported our people who were there more so supported them when they got home yeah right and uh i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part exactly and i i saw the movie Born On The Fourth Of July and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times um-hum yeah more than was apocalypse now um-hum well Dudley have we pretty well discussed the subject well i think so i enjoyed talking to you uh-huh bye-bye yeah i think so yes it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye  well do you watch much TV well i watch in the evening with my kids your kids how many kids do you have i have four children oh goodness i have got two that's about all i want well yeah it keeps you busy doesn't it yeah they do they're still babies uh my children like to watch Sesame Street i watch with them every once in a while but that is not my favorite programs oh well we have only get two channels we do not have cable but i am not crazy about TV much it just uh-huh well it kind of is an idiot box now Sesame Street is a good program because uh i do have that on videotape and i will let him watch that every once in a while and he has learned to count to twenty from that so uh-huh yeah it can be very educational there are shows that that i like uh i like good family shows uh though uh i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie yeah uh-huh okay and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money right i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway right but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do uh yeah i mean like i said real life is not that easy yeah and uh i watch a show that i like it for entertainment uh it is called the Quantum Leap oh i love Quantum Leap i watch that show every time and uh yes that is a good show i i like uh how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes uh-huh um because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone he has to do something positive to help them uh-huh right he always got to change history is what it is so i yeah yeah usually yeah that it is so good i was glad when they put that back on this channel because like i said we only get two channels because we do not get cable it me too me too uh-huh and still my little boy he watches videotapes he won't hum this is terrible i do not like him sitting in front of the TV all day no that's not terrible i do not think that's terrible at all well it but it is a not really a good baby sitter well it's really not he needs to get outside and play and he's four years old and he just does not like to go out there by his self and i'll let him watch the TV when i am wanting to get my house work done uh-huh but other than that i do not like him glued to the TV all the time well i do not think it's it's healthy all the time either huh uh and my kids like to to go play with their friends and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit now i there are shows i do not have cable either and there are shows that i really put my foot down on if there starts to be a lot of violence i do not go for that uh-huh i will not let them watch that if there is a lot of language or well we made the mistake right we made the mistake of getting Robocop and that is one of the worst oh i do not let him watch it anymore because just the pieces l uh-huh like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good i mean it is just real violent i mean well it you know today i watched and it is like they show bloody you know things and they show it in slow motion and uh-huh uh-huh and everything like that and before in a western or something in the in the olden days you would see somebody get shot they would just fall down yeah and they were gone and and it wasn't uh not like today uh yeah so graphic today it's it's really graphic they try to make it too realistic uh-huh yeah too much realism i think sometimes and yeah i don't now he is watching Honey I Shrunk The Kids right now oh that is a fun show oh i really like that one it is cute and that little Roger Rabbit on before that that is cute and they have got the He Man uh uh-huh the cartoon or the Masters Of The Universe the movie oh uh-huh that is a real cute show that has good moral values too He Man uh-huh well uh i think uh yeah good versus evil huh yeah yeah oh well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway yeah at least we have the same ideas yeah yeah language too and language and violence and sexual you you know things i i get kind of uh saying i am sorry kids this is and i i think it is important that i see uh-huh yeah what they're watching yeah they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch if you mean in cable oh i do not know because i do not have that but uh-huh well my my uh stepfather and them have my stepfather my father-in-law and them have that uh-huh and uh they do not have any kids but they was told how to use that but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control oh do they huh they're too smart i think all you have to do is push a couple buttons uh-huh so it's it's i'm hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes Josey Wells now he loves to watch Josey Wells uh-huh i think that is a good show too yeah uh-huh yeah Clint Eastwood and like The Man From Showy River we've oh my husband likes westerns and he also likes Star Trek now Star Trek are good movies good shows uh-huh the uh series we have got a lot of those uh i think not even the old one but the new one too i like both of those uh-huh The Next Generation yeah my little boy is crazy about Captain Kirk and my little girl has Mister Spock's ears uh-huh yeah oh and i told my husband he cursed my kids they were both born with pointy ears yeah oh well not real pointy my little boy grew out of it oh that is not a problem anyway but it is fun to you know seeing the show anyway uh now i like uh everything Michael oh no not Michael Douglas um no uh-huh oh i can't think of his name Kirk Douglas no the the man right now who is having uh who has done uh Bonanza and then he did Little House On The Prairie Michael Landon there you go Michael Landon i have always liked and thought he did good shows oh Michael Landon oh now there yeah like Highway to Heaven uh-huh here are some cookies Kyle yeah i liked Highway To Heaven and i and i thought that was kind of neat though but i loved Little House On The Prairie especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up she was kind of like my yeah yeah idol when i was growing up because i am twenty seven so it is you know she is about the same age as i am i wanted to be just like her because she is so cute uh-huh yeah i and i liked that show because it it portrayed i thought really well uh pioneer kind of days yeah and well i liked it but there that is about the only uh you know but show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat uh-huh yeah because there is not a lot of shows that do that i and uh they have this little cartoon that's on Sunday mornings now what is that with Jot i remember him in school but i do not it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes and his parents are there they have it like before one of the church things uh you know church that comes on uh-huh and it is a just this little dot and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that and it is just oh i have not seen that well it's usually we go to church on Sundays but we will miss every once in a while and i will let Kyle watch that and he just well i even like Jot i mean i it is funny uh-huh what channel is it on it is on channel well let us see you're in Plano uh-huh uh it's twelve or ten down here well i will look and and see yeah we go to church on Sunday about one o'clock is when our meetings start and uh oh well this is of the mornings uh around nine or ten i think it is before one of the i think it is before the First Baptist in Sherman airs i think that is the one that it is in the morning okay it uh comes on before but it's real cute well he's bouncing around and his name is Jot and then he has got a friend named Cat well we'll look and i think the dog is the only one that's not a a dot but it is real cute and like i say they they teach him stuff from the Bible and i think it is just a real cute show i'm trying to get my little boy into reading uh like church books and things we have got like Noah's Ark and uh-huh oh Lord is My Shepherd we have got about eight or twelve books for him just little Bible stories and they're he is he is getting to where he likes them uh-huh yeah we got him a little Jesus doll uh about a year ago and he has always kept that he likes it well i really like now we get channel fifty five although we do not have cable we do get channel fifty five and that is a uh like a uh-huh a song they sing songs on there but they're uh worship through music kind of things but they are up to date uh and some of them are like uh videos like music videos that go along with the songs about church and Jesus and and i uh-huh so it's a uh Christian songs yeah the Christian it's called the Christian music station or something like that oh that sounds fun that's sound good well and uh i really like that uh i turn that on on Sunday mornings and i do not you know and so my kids don't uh i have an yeah  do you know something about how to take care of kids yeah i was just wondering how did this get on my list how how did this subject get on my list oh well i'm not sure um it's what i i don't know i've got mine well uh my children are grown now but i used care child care services uh for a number of years and i i don't know if i had it to do it over again maybe i would be a little more selective and really you know find out more about them i think the main thing was that i needed someone to take care of my children and i and i generally used some place that was either you know uh close to where i lived or close to where i worked and i really never had any had any real problems and i always felt like that they did a good job and um but i don't have small children now so uh i don't know if it would be different now you know i hear i hear i know a lot of uh mothers or uh people that i work with and they are you know putting their children in different places well yeah i i don't have kids yet um i won't for a couple uh for at least two or three years and my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point um um so you yeah uh i suppose uh depends it depends on what kind of program they have especially for summer summer programs um whether or not you know a lot of it is uh when they're in school and you know their after school thing you'd hope that they would have time for studying but most of the time they don't they just play yeah but uh i think Summer time i'll i i know i was talking to one lady she's just changing her daughter to a different uh child care center for the Summer because they have so much more structured time and they offer different classes like her daughter's going to be taking gymnastics and she said if she had left her where that she was uh previously that a lot of time would you know just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted do and a lot of times they get bored so that's actually yeah what i've been i'm thinking of the child care center because they have like licensing procedures and and stuff like that that seems to me you know good and i mean it is a state license to seemingly more often than not that means that they're good and they have lots of activities and people who know how to take care of the kids um-hum and some and i guess the ratio of of workers to children you know would be something to consider uh especially if they're little bitty children that would be a i would i i would hate to leave an uh a real small baby you know um-hum uh before say before three or four years old anything anyone younger younger than that i'd just kind of feel kind of uncomfortable about leaving the child but with somebody else yeah oh i agree yeah but i did it so i mean but but i look back on some of the things that i did with my kids and i shudder and i wonder actually i wonder about costs because most people i know who who have kids you know uh one parent doesn't work a part of the time you know only works part time and takes care of the kid part time and then it turns out that that person's salary just winds up going to paying um-hum the people who who who take care of the kids that's true that's true you know that which which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be so basically i think that that when they do that that person really feels a need to get out of the house and you know even if their the money is going mostly to child care they're not really having much to take home yeah it's something a filling fulfilling another another need i suppose than staying home with with children all the time but that's a tough deal to do too too you know but uh it'd be nice to to work you know i don't know i don't know a good solution to that but but it's it's tough to be i started i started to say stuck at home with children all the time and never getting out that that's just probably not a real good way to put it yeah that but some people you know they their their life and children can be a full time job and you don't have time for anything else so you so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but i don't know yeah i don't i don't you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just who cares if it if if all your salary goes to pay somebody you sort of get away for a while too we have i don't i don't um it's strange it's funny that i should get this particular we should be on this topic now because uh because we have even though we have no kids we have people staying with us um-hum um-hum um for the for the for the for the the weekend and they have a six a six year old son and a three month old son oh so i'm just sort of seeing what all the hassles are you know of you know like last night we we we the six year old decided he wanted to go camping in the back yard so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a boy's a boys' night out oh really in the back yard and about quarter of one he woke up half crying and he couldn't sleep and this and that i mean we we wanted to bring him inside so when about a one o'clock in the morning we all got up and sort of wandered inside so i'm think all the benefits of taking care of kids or all the fun part of taking care of kids i guess uh-huh yeah i tell you it's uh yeah maybe it's something before you start having children you know maybe there's a lot of stuff but but if if you'll never have them if you start doing all that get too logical about it but it's great it's great having kids and then uh yeah i think everybody ought to ought to try it yeah we plan on a couple of years and i just like it's just like child care will become very important to my life then yeah yeah she'll probably she'll probably spend a lot more time finding the right place uh you know i don't know i i tend to think if they're licensed then they're you know i don't know i you know you you can feel you can get a feel from it too if your child is too small you can't but if you if they're old enough to to know you know they'll they'll let you know if they're unhappy or if or if someone isn't treating them well or yeah that that that that's probably true although i i don't like you say i don't know if i'd put a kid there who's less than you know uh four years old or something i'll tell you one thing is that my of course i'm i'm a single parent and so i guess and um my my son was five and my daughter was two and i had uh they had to go in child care but uh but i think they were more uh well i uh my sister who had two boys and she did not work and she and she had a real difficult time when the when time for them to go to school they did not uh want to leave her and my children who were so used to being out and uh learning how to get along with other children and taking directions and stuff like that they just went very smoothly off into school you know without a problem so i think even if you don't leave them full time but have them you know preschool or mother's day out or couple things a couple of days a week or something like that i think it's always good yeah probably just to make friends and and stuff like that um-hum yeah i if it's just like i say this is a very foreign topic for me so so one of those things i have to learn about i do i work with kids a lot you do i i i do work with kids a lot i uh i i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids oh oh what age um they're four to seven actually there's one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i i'm i'm the class so i i help out in this class and uh and it's really um weird because i'm not you know the first when i first started doing it i i can put it this way it it it's helped me gain lots of respect for people who can work with lots large numbers of kids um-hum because when i first started like i had no idea how to how to handle a five five year old kid with especially when there are ten of the m floating around and you're supposed to be running around teaching them things and um do they pay have uh their attention span is it do do you have a hard time holding their attention of course uh i i do but i'm finding there's there's uh another person there who has good he has got absolutely no training from what i know but he's just wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them he does lots of you know he's he's he's fast moving with them they'll do this exercise they'll do that they'll do this they'll do that he keeps them moving quick enough that you know when they stop losing attention they start you know they're the all of a sudden they're switched um-hum and you know there're a couple in there who actually have um who i think have attention deficit disorders or they have very very low attention and those are harder to work with but i you know but i i i i uh the regular ones you know the normal kids you can just let them go a little bit and and and he sort of he's real good at keeping them in line i'm learning from him how to do these sort of things just just by watching him did you say uh your karate class is all boys or mixed no it's it's boys and girls it it it it's mixed there are uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of number of girls in there who actually uh do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls i mean i mean a lot of the little boys too is that right why why would a parent want their child to take karate or is it the child wants to take it uh um in some case actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring their kids because because of the sort of discipline you know and it it's not we don't you know say get down and do a hundred push ups for me now you little guy but um it teaches we we we focus very highly on you know on on on issues of respect and self-discipline and self-confidence we have a lot of students kids who come in very shy you know and unsure of themselves and and you can see them come you know week by week that they come more and more out of their shells and start to become you know more sociable and more sure of themselves instead of more sure footed hm you know um and the parents love it actually they find you know we we we there are rules like the kids aren't allowed kids have to bring their report card in every after every quarter or whenever or whenever they get their report cards they have to bring them in to make sure that they're keeping up with their grades  well uh it seems to me that uh that i don't know whether the jury system uh i i shouldn't say i don't know i don't feel very uh stronger that the jury system should be changed it seems to have worked uh uh time immemorial and when uh difficult decisions uh are made uh uh uh they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on uh i know in some cases now in some states depending on the criminal code um-hum and uh a unanimous verdict isn't required and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people they're down to as little small as six people in i think in petty in in uh in uh minor felonies and uh and misdemeanor trials um-hum um i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing simply because uh there's always uh there's there's always a jury that might be swayed uh by the moment uh to either be too lenient or too vengeful i guess yeah on the other hand uh attorney uh uh justices are more apt to uh understand you know the crime the prison crowding problems and things like that and have that sway their decisions one way or the other yeah but i mean isn't that uh is that a reflection then of what's really happening in the real world if if if they keep giving everybody you know uh hundred year sentences and the people in various states it doesn't seem that people want to be taxed to build more prisons or even in for that matter uh repair the uh the lack of judges and and and other uh yeah i think that's what's happening i think uh the judges are trying to save the people from having to the cost of new prisons they're yeah you know that might be it i mean they they certainly there saying oh well you know the the people can't afford it i don't i don't know how it is in Virginia but in Florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on Today uh without any specific recommendation for uh uh uh uh uh uh uh waving the normal uh procedures and the eighteen years will uh translate into something like uh four point seven if every if the if the prisoner is a model prisoner and indeed the present overcrowding conditions uh right prevail plus i guess there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial right so uh yeah you might be right about that i i i do not know it just seems to me that only about uh from what i read only about ninety percent of the cases only about ten percent of the cases come for trial anyway right and uh only about uh four four four or five percent of uh in the in the very end or less than less than half the trials that go to uh uh less than half the cases that go to trial uh end up with with uh with the jury actually making the verdict with a conviction oh okay that most of it's plea bargained uh half way through or or uh most of the cases are plea bargained anyway right but uh uh how do you feel about the about the jury system itself do you you think that should be changed or do do you know in Virginia whether it's if they have smaller juries or um i don't know exactly what the size of the juries i know one of my friends was uh uh brought up for jury duty for and he only heard very you know piddly type cases yeah most of it was uh robberies or things like that you know it wasn't any serious crimes so apparently even for the smallest crimes they give the person the you know any felony anyways they they give the person the option for a jury yeah well i guess we do yeah i guess we always focus on criminal trials with with the jury but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in in any sort of a case that even where damages are are are uh are are the results of some sort of a uh an action that you're bringing against someone else you can ask for that to be heard before a jury takes a heck of a long time i guess to get there um-hum in some states i i i don't know uh i should imagine Virginia from what i read uh uh is like every other state it it's faced with uh uh-huh uh enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system because i guess everywhere i read that there's a shortage of judges right right not that they won't appoint them but there's no budget for them i guess or huh and the courthouse that goes with them and the bailiffs and the clerk uh or clerks yeah whatever so it seems uh no i i i don't think i'd change it the more i verbalize it i i don't think i'd want to change the system right uh i don't think i would either i don't know what we'd replace it with yeah i know it uh does seem like the the the the purpose of getting people in jail so that you know the the i can't think of the word i'm looking for anyways the deterrent yes for people to to commit the crime uh to not to commit the crime is sort of gone away people have i don't know they just don't care any more the benefit i guess of crime outweighs what the deterrent is you know people that uh and yet there are there are so many there are so many people in prison i mean the prison population uh as far as i i uh you know my impression of it is that it's that it's doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty hum i mean it so so i guess our population has grown some too but there there definitely is uh uh you know to me the one of the worst things that could ever happen uh from what i read and see and understand i mean i don't think i could handle prison yeah well i'd be interested in finding out what the uh i mean it was very difficult percentage of drug related type things are and uh well there must be a a a a a very great degree of that but yeah but there again i i don't know if the the jury system itself uh comes in to play there i would think that one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability of course that it's a constitutional right that the press must have here is the the interviewing of jurors after the trial i mean that it seems to me that that that when a jury makes a decision they shouldn't be asked uh before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision i mean i don't huh right i imagine there's a certain certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that but i i would think i if i did anything i'd protect the juror from from any sort of an inquisition after um well i know uh on the other hand though when uh after the Barry trial up here you know that was a big local trial as well as national yeah yeah oh yeah yeah well i do a lot of business up in Washington i was there during the during the trial actually yeah yeah and the opposite was true of me uh after the case was over i was like somebody get ahold of these people and find out why in the world did they vote the way they did you know it was like well pictures isn't good enough we want to see i don't know what they wanted i mean yeah yeah yeah they want the guy to i don't know i mean just because you feel like he was being kicked on which he certainly was you know i think uh no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be prosecuted oh i felt that way i felt i felt but it doesn't matter the guy was obviously guilty no but yeah i always balanced in the in the situation i remember the jurors uh i thought to myself how did how did they only i think they only found uh found him guilty on one count which was uh not even which was a class something felony which was not even punishable one one count yeah uh uh to the degree that they thought it but i don't know maybe when you're there in the room in the courtroom yourself and you're sitting there and you've got to make a judgment on somebody and the prosecutors do a lousy job or maybe the evidence was as sensational as the media presented it i mean i i'm not making excuses for right that might be it well yeah i think we're getting but i think i'm getting a call coming in okay all right nice talking with you thank you well it's been nice talking to you um-hum bye-bye  do you y'all do you get together with family reunions or yes we try to uh we have not in some years now and i think we are going to try to have one this summer oh that will be fun if you haven't done it in a while my aunt is planning it oh where is your family from uh Missouri oh southwest part of Missouri so you are going to have to go there that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh yeah they are all getting very very old all my aunts and uncles so we need to see them soon oh yeah my family is from Kentucky most of them is down there uh-huh i have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas right do you all get together often or we did when i was growing up it was every summer we got together now my grandmother just passed away this last year so uh-huh right you know she was the i think as we get older it is difficult more difficult to uh when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now so it is uh uh-huh i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these days yeah but uh well it i still have elderly parents alive so uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that it sure does and if they are well we in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together we just did it word by mouth you know by word of mouth right you know my uncle in Louisiana he is the only one that you know had to travel uh-huh and now i have got a sister in Germany and oh my gosh we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family yeah so the yeah and we need to have more and more of them i hope i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world yeah because it is so fun i mean yeah it is we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters oh i see yeah she has got a huge family and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them you know have got kids uh-huh sure that makes a big crowd yeah it we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures yeah is that is that right yes and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun that is wonderful i hope yeah well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this June so i don't imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost June yeah well i so we have always had ours in a park or something but it has away been the same park and there is nothing really special there only thing is it is big and it is open uh-huh yeah that's we have it usually at this uh at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains and um-hum and uh you have to have it uh fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there uh-huh in Missouri in Missouri yeah it is too muggy it is not it is just uh very humid and the old people cannot take it anymore well that was part of the problem with well that was part of the problem with the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming uh-huh and like i said we was just stupid kids we was like eight and ten years old um-hum and our parents came and caught us we had been playing in the sump it was part of the sewage cleaning system isn't that great yeah yeah Kyle don't i have got a four year old yeah well that keeps you busy yeah yeah but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better yeah it would have been something for the young people to to do but yeah well they there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool just about a foot deep um-hum yeah yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway every family has all that going on i am sure so oh but i love it all the different foods because that yeah oh i do too that is the best part of it that's the yeah everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic and oh grand yeah so how long did you say it has been since you all had one i do not know i think it has been uh four three or four years or five even uh since they have had it tried to get everybody together they are just spread out so much and and we really need to uh no matter how what kind of crowd they get yeah i hope well i have been married almost five so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then we've lost um-hum oh well just our grandmother that is surprising yeah well time flies so fast it may have been that that long since we have one it is hard to remember but i think it has been about four or five years um-hum so uh anyway i i hope both our families get to have one soon oh if i can ever get down to Kentucky it has been like four years since i have been home yeah it is difficult with little ones i know when we had had our yeah that is the reason that is the reason i don't i would get on a bus any day by myself but i won't do it with the babies um-hum because uh i have got uh a four month old and a four year old sure oh Lord so i am just starting and i just quit too oh i am telling you that's uh uh i won't be adding any more to the family reunion no i hope it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that yeah they are good kids though yeah so uh i am not too upset anyways i've enjoyed talking to you enjoyed talking to you good luck in everything all right all right you too bye-bye bye-bye  what do you think about gun control well uh i am probably uh closer to being a what is it the ten is on the end of uh no gun control uh-huh i guess i am probably closer to a ten than a one i believe i am uh i am not opposed at all to having a waiting period for you know for the purchase of guns yeah uh i think that is appropriate uh a background check on people that uh excuse me especially especially people that buy handguns um-hum uh but i believe that uh you know the Constitution gives uh the individual the right to own firearms for you know for their whatever their own purposes are as long as they are legal purposes and uh i am opposed to anything that would limit what the Constitution allows yeah and i i think i think that is right uh the only thing i object to is like uh machine guns yeah i i i uh i agree with that uh although i can i can see where there might be even be a a potential uh sometime you know a need sometime in the future for the individuals to have yeah uh even machine guns available uh you know if if we were ever invaded of course now that is pretty far fetched but if the United States were ever invaded i think that the man on the street is going have to be the one to defend the country at some point or or might have to at some point and uh i think that there should be uh sufficient sufficient uh guns and you know and ammunition and things available for that do you think um like Reagan of course before that you know he was in westerns all that all that time and and uh he was real gung ho And then then just now just this last year it seems like he's he was uh and he was not that bill does not restrict anything outside of just having to wait seven days but right it is interesting that he turned around for some reason yeah well i i always wondered you know why he was so adamant about you know about being opposed to that waiting period um-hum uh you know even before i mean you know i i did not see that the waiting period was a you know it was a major restriction um-hum i think and i think a lot of times you know that uh criminals do not go out and buy a excuse me what uh uh a good gun costs like two hundred to five hundred dollars um-hum you know a handgun they go out and buy the cheapest thing they can right and and then they go rob a liquor store or something yeah and uh plus you know i guess my opinion is that if uh if a uh criminal or somebody with criminal intent real criminal intent wants a gun they are going to get one yeah that is true uh the drug dealer is not going to you know he's not going to wait the seven days for a gun anyway right so it is it is only the actually it is only the the uh the people that are trying to be uh law abiding people are the ones that are going to wind up being able to get the guns legally um-hum uh you know after even with the waiting period and i you know i cannot see that uh that there is anybody that that does not have criminal intent that would have uh any reason to object to that waiting period that is um-hum that is right and a lot of times like um what is his name i can't remember his name right the guy in the Austin tower uh Whitman yeah Whitman you know he was sane and and i guess they could have said like Lee Harvey Oswald Oswald was sane when he bought his gun you know but he bought his by mail anyway um-hum but later on you know something can happen they can they can have a brain tumor or they can break down one way or another right well uh you know Hinckley was the one that took the shot at Reagan and uh he bought his gun at a pawn shop here in Dallas i think or somewhere in the Dallas area right um-hum and you know if if he'd had to have a waiting period he didn't stay in Dallas long enough uh at that time to have waited the seven days right so if if there'd been a waiting period he wouldn't have had the gun uh or a least he wouldn't have had that gun he might've had another one yeah he might have but uh you know so i you know i can see that there are are reasons for having a waiting period that uh i think that anybody that you know anybody that does not have a a criminal background or you know any any real reason to not allow them to have one i think that anybody that wants one should be able to buy one um-hum that's interesting because i don't own one though i don't own a gun but that's you know that's my personal opinion anyway yeah yeah i do not either yeah that is true because you know once once they start clamping down on one thing or being against one group then the it gives them a foothold to to be against somebody else right and uh and the hunters you know the hunters uh with what game species there are left well especially i mean using a rifle white tail deers mostly right you know that is what people hunt for the most with a rifle uh you know they have every right to have a a rifle and be able to to hunt right you know they rifles and shotguns for you know for like you say for deer hunting and for bird hunting are you know that is kind of the the American way so to speak um-hum and that um i think it was a rifle that that kid shot that burglar with in Arlington or wherever it was uh yes i think it's two years ago or so now yeah i believe it was yeah uh there was a a uh deal on television just uh i saw it uh yesterday or the day before where there was an an Oriental shopkeeper in California i think it was in San Bernardino California you know um-hum That there were five young guys they were gang members that came in to rob his store and they all had guns and he had a gun somewhere under the counter that he got and he shot all five of those killed two of them but you know he he was really blazing away yeah i wondered how he managed that and uh i think he got shot twice himself and uh but he was okay you know it was just he was injured but not seriously apparently um-hum but uh you know it was really surprising but it was good you know from my point of view it was good to see him being able to defend him you know his his property and his store exactly and uh you know i i think that is you know that is the intent of the Constitution is to of that part of the Constitution is to allow people to defend themselves and their property um-hum and and more and more of that kind of thing happens i mean can you imagine i mean it used to be like with the dapper bandit is one guy you know um-hum with a gun and a a lot of the stuff that he did they did not publicize because that it would breach the security of the rest of the banks the banks right one of the things that he did is is um any counter top that was there up to maybe like four feet high he could vertical jump on top of the counter top and and jump down and and be um-hum with those people behind the counter before they knew it right you know and they they showed us a piece of tape of that one time but it looked like they had cut it up some and that was one of the things that was so scary about him right and not only did he he um rob banks but he uh at the time when he first started he robbed the Safeway that my brother was working at at the time and that is how he that is how he surprised the cashier he jumped he jumped back there with her and and you know there was nothing she could do by that time um-hum i had i had not heard about him robbing the Safeway yeah but then there is also there is the uh what is his name Bernie Getz um-hum the in the New York subway i guess uh well i would have even mixed emotions about him uh somebody carrying a gun you know out into the public on public transportation right uh you know of course he was his the purpose of him having the gun was to defend himself because he apparently he had felt threatened you know on the on the subway before um-hum but uh i am not sure that uh the private citizen carrying a gun is you know just the routine private citizen carrying a gun um-hum is uh necessary to yeah i would i mean if you are not if you are not uh in a position where you have to defend yourself you know uh in a routine basis then uh perhaps carrying a gun on your person is not uh is not all that advisable yeah and then uh i know that they are talking about here you know here in Texas about having a new gun law that would allow certain certain individuals to be licensed to carry a gun um-hum and uh i think they ought take a long a good long hard look at at who is allowed to carry a gun in those you know in those situations yeah right like the the judge what was it two or three months ago the judge in uh Fort Worth i think maybe it was Dallas but he he just convicted uh a man for murder and the guy jumped up and and apparently knew where the judge kept his gun um-hum and held it on him for a couple of hours you know and right he should he should either have kept it fairly well concealed or kept it a secret right you know i guess that i do not really know uh i i guess there is not really a you know a lot to say from my point of view except that you know the the Constitution says what kind of rights we have and i do not i really do not see the the point  hi my last uh auto repair was my my uh alternator went out i have a nineteen eighty six Toyota uh it's a little Tercel uh-huh and uh i have a friend a friend whose real good with uh repairing cars so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and uh you know get a replacement part uh-huh we went to a uh a a place called Quality Auto Parts an and their parts are supposed to be guaranteed and and everything and they're they're uh very reasonable so uh i bought the alternator we put put it on the car and it it didn't work and it blew out all the fuses oh no yeah how much was the alternator uh i believe something like sixty nine dollars something something on that order did he did he hook up the wire wiring wrong no he hooked it up right it it was just that the the part just just didn't fit the car so i took it back and uh he he took the alternator the guy in in the parts shop took the alternator and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them and uh he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator so we we went back and tried it again put it on again and it still didn't work and we took the car up to um a little place called Pep Boys i don't know if you have them in your area uh-huh but uh they're they're pretty reasonable uh car repair place also so uh took it up there towed it up there because it you know wouldn't start or anything and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and uh took them about an an hour to um figure out what was what was blowing the fuse and it was it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse anyway ended up taking it to the Toyota dealer and the only problem was that uh it had to be a genuine Toyota uh alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it that that you know they sit in there and everything but there's just some little difference that um causes it not to work uh-huh they probably built that in so they could make money and i yeah yeah i guess so and that was my that was my last experience well i had a weird there's a little sensing device uh in front of my um um i'm not sure right in front of the fan fan it's a it's an air conditioner sensing device i don't know why it actually there's a metal piece that fits through the belts uh and somehow that broke off and uh i i still can't figure out how it broke and uh anyway so a this piece obviously um i have a Subaru and uh i think you can only get it through Subaru dealer etcetera so uh-huh uh this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks uh-huh goodness are you able and and i haven't had too many problems with my car i got a eighty eight Subaru GL XT and it uh uh-huh uh and then you know just basic maintenance and oil changes an i and i do not do my oil changes and i will not do my oil changes i've i think the first time i tried to do one ended up um trying to get uh you borrowed somebody else's jack and i did this and i went and bought everything so after buying the filter and all the oil you're looking at ten bucks at least or somewhere in there an uh-huh uh-huh and uh and then to go to the trouble that i figured it's easier spending eighteen bucks at Jiffy Lube yeah so that that's um you know as far as any maintenance on my car that i shy away from the oil changes that's for sure uh-huh well my car is uh it's an eighty six and i really hadn't had any any trouble with it until until that and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it and uh and this was just recent so i really can't complain about this one how did you put that many miles on it in um well i used four or five years i used to work uh it was a seventy mile trip everyday you know two ways was seventy miles oh a hundred and forty mile trip no it was it was just seventy miles yeah oh thirty five miles each way yeah and uh i did that for about three years and it really it really added up i've only taken uh maybe two trips that were about four hours long down uh down to Shreveport and uh the rest of it was you know it's just basically driving a long ways to work and now i drive like twenty twenty three miles each way so i'm getting a little a little uh little relief but still i drive a long ways yeah but i guess because they're highway miles you know it's not so bad on your car as as if it you know were just regular street uh-huh do you work for TI you know yes i do okay do you i was going to ask you you know as far as how we're getting compensated for what we're doing right now um i don't work for TI and i'm just i get these green i don't know what you want to call them fake points point things and uh i just wondering how i go about getting my cash uh there's a number that you call it's the same number that you that you call to make a call oh okay you you call that number and and uh somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message and you can leave a message okay i know someone that did that you leave a message and they'll they'll call you back okay all right well that's good to know i haven't been doing this this is the first time i've been called in a long time and i haven't been doing it so oh really and uh i've done it maybe twelve times uh-huh well i don't know if i've done it quite that much but uh mine is mixed up too i have to call and get it fixed um uh let's see before i had this car i had a um um i bought an Audi five thousand uh-huh but i bought it i bought it used i i just bought it from a friend who was going to who just charged me what the dealer was going to give give him for it for a trade-in and uh it had a whole lot of miles on it i i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it an i an i did get a couple of good years out of it and the uh the engi ne messed up on me and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the automotive for the Audi dealer and uh he took the engine apart and you know he just said he couldn't fix it so the engine never got put back together again huh oh well i i was driving a sixty six Plymouth Fury wow i think those old cars yeah yep and might might be a pretty good bet because you i don't know i oh that that's when they made cars though this things was the body was in good condition and you know it ran fine it was starting to burn some oil uh-huh um and um but i had to you know get you know i after about three couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car so uh-huh i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventy four yeah well you know these cars made in the sixties and stuff i mean the steel i mean the thickness i mean it those thing they're just the you just don't see cars like that and they last a long time and they were simple too the engines were simple and durable and uh-huh yeah some people will still buy them you know they'll yeah it's easy to it's easy i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars engines and transmissions and if you i guess if you keep trading changing them out you can keep a car for a long time course i guess i could do the same thing with the the Toyota that i have i just don't know how much they'll charge me to it always costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it you're just better off buying another car yeah i guess so but i just think they cost too much in the in the first place now a days  what type of news media do you prefer for keeping up with current events okay normally i watch uh TV okay uh usually twice a day the news shows themselves or uh like network news or national or uh oh basically network news okay how about shows like uh Sixty Minutes or or Twenty Twenty was it once in a while depending what i think's going to come on when they put on the previews yeah i kind of watch for uh what what they're going to cover on Sixty Minutes if it's not if it doesn't look interesting uh pass on that yeah that's about what i do but uh usually i hit the headlines when i walk by book stores or anything else on papers but i normally don't buy newspapers yeah i'll only get the newspaper a couple of days a week but uh i get a lot of calls from uh the Morning News and the Times Herald where they want to sell me the paper at a special rate but uh no i'll only read it on on Fridays and Sundays typically Fridays and Sundays why Friday Friday because they have a house and garden section in the paper oh okay Sunday's usually my big one yeah i get the Sunday paper because of the TV schedule but i'll flip through and see what read the headlines see what's new yeah i enjoy just point blank reading basically the headlines and i go especially if i've seen something one way or the other and i hit the TV to find out actually what's going on around here yeah i i don't listen to the radio for news that's strictly for entertainment while i'm driving to and from work oh it's same way here and for waking up in the morning have to set the alarm whatever news they cover they usually read out of the newspaper that day what about when um Desert Storm was on oh i thought CNN was great but uh i was glued to the TV all during that time watching CNN but after after it was over i haven't even tuned in to CNN since yeah well see i had the radio going on that almost all the time especially between jobs on that and that's when i hit the radio but uh-huh when they stopped i stopped yeah there has to be absolutely nothing else on TV before i turn on CNN usually but uh now i like see i usually i hit the six o'clock and usually the ten but uh sometimes i have to search on ten because they get boring they pick up the same thing on six so i usually have to search to see if anything is come up or not yeah uh i'll catch uh some of these news briefs that they have say at the top of the hour in the evening right and they'll mention the subject and say they have details at ten i hate it when they do that because i usually don't catch the news at ten o'clock and they don't fill you in at that time on uh what's going on even though it's something interesting that you may want to watch do you ever discuss at work um yeah usually with the people i work with uh uh we don't talk too much about the news but if something comes up uh yeah it's a topic for discussion at the lunch table now see usually when i was working at TI we hit about eight o'clock in the morning we all just what was news and coming up and all so we just hack it out between all of us one way or the other uh-huh no we don't discuss too much uh too much news except for at lunch unless there are rumors for pertaining to layoffs or company business things of that nature but uh well ours was kind of strange because we'd hit um since we were all females and uh we'd hit either the blacks because two of us were black one one two three four of us are white uh-huh and so it would be a cross between all of it going in together and uh i really enjoyed that i really enjoyed that because we got a cross section of viewpoints yeah and it was fascinating in the morning so we ended up getting there well we were all there usually by seven thirty you get a lot of different perspectives that way it was it was fascinating it really was i really enjoyed it and i think everyone else did otherwise we wouldn't keep doing it every morning uh-huh do you get any news magazines but no okay i don't get any news magazines but i do get a uh a photography magazine that does have a lot of photo journalism in it which is interesting oh that would be interesting instead of reading about the news you get to look at the pictures i'm not uh i don't seem to find time to read too much except of the stuff i'm studying right now uh-huh but uh news wise that way no but i have realized most of mine uh from the TV i think has increased watching the news okay since the since the war yeah yeah i think the coverage has gotten better are are you real satisfied with the TV news coverage um are there other things that you'd like them to to spend more time on they're they're very limited they have half hour to provide provide all the news weather sports and what not and uh most of the major stories are the same across all the network major networks but uh they do have uh uh scoops and specific stories that um i'll say one network that another one won't cover well see i'm like as i said i pick up on Sixty Minutes or Twenty Twenty usually my favorite is Sixty Minutes uh-huh and i'll pick up on them and find out what they're going to see and then i'll pick up the rest of the stories stories like that and get into like that but yeah not uh most of the time if a really interesting one thing or another i'll go a little bit further but usually it's i just don't have the time yeah i think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh TV networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news but i can understand now why some of the newspaper's circulation has gone down because it's so much easier to watch the TV and keep at least ninety percent abreast and watching you know reading the newspaper and forget it yeah well it's like i read a lot at work and i really have to make an effort to read anything when i get home i think that's why uh uh reading newspaper suffers to watching TV and TV is more entertaining uh it uh usually have it on all the time when i'm at home whether i'm watching it or not well i got tired with newspapers because i seem to stack them up without reading them yeah um that's why i stopped that's uh that's a weekly chore get rid of the old newspapers that haven't been read i found out when i got the newspaper that it i'd read the headlines front page and maybe through a couple other sections and then i start packing them up and i'm going i never read this what am i you know why even subscribe to it when i'm not reading it yeah well i get the Sunday paper tomorrow and i'll pull out the TV section and put that aside and i get out the sports section and read that and then i start clipping coupons and if i have any time uh later in the week to read the rest of it i may pick it up and uh glance at it but u h i usually don't scan it cover to cover well see like when they have that recycle program on was it Save the Earth Save America i think what it was yeah i watched that twice i recorded that because there were some things in there i wanted huh that i hadn't written down so i had recorded that but you can't find that in the newspaper that's interesting no but see i take that as far as my concern that's news to me uh-huh because i enjoy something like that but uh i wonder about the rest of the world in itself how much they get or how much i talk to people that i work with at night now and the younger group they don't watch too much right they don't even see it but i think they're being raised watching TV more than newspapers yeah i believe that's true so i wish they'd put a little bit more depth in some of their stories uh-huh yeah well think that's that gets back to what i was saying before about uh the say the network news coverage they only have so much time to provide so much uh coverage of the news and they can't get very in depth in the with the within the limitations of the time that they have to present it i think they could use a little more of it a little bit wiser and put a little more positive in some of their stories than complete negative all the time well sure but uh you're talking about uh sensationalism here that you have to report the news and typically news is is uh or types the types of events that uh shock people or uh uh major crimes uh court cases things of that nature and most uh it's just a fact that most things that make news are are bad types of occurrences they aren't uh positive in nature well that's too true to a degree if they can put a complete half hour TV program on of what police have done to um or fireman you know off handed when they go in and find people or going down all all sorts of things you know what i'm talking about yeah there is a show on sorry about that there is a show on in fact it was on tonight at eight o'clock called Cops have you ever seen that right i've seen parts of it that's one of them that's very very interesting gives you a whole new perspective of the police department um there there is lots of stories out there about people what they've done out of you know stop on the highway and stop someone uh just because there was an accident one way or the other right to me that's positive yeah well i think they actually came up with that to show not just to to fill in on Saturday night but to promote the image of the police department because it does show uh what positive impact the police have in the society not just that they're always there when bad things happen see so you wouldn't see like that's a cop show fine but there's positive in many different areas oh yeah that they could push a little bit more on TV well like environmentalist and uh  so what movies have you seen uh well i have uh seen Dances With Wolves which is probably the the best movie that i have seen lately uh i do not go out to films very often uh-huh so as far as out of the house so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in uh and i see some that way but uh i am not real current on films how about you yeah i saw Dances With Wolves and uh Home Alone and i hear that's really good but i haven't seen it yet yeah it is about a little kid that that his parents go off to Paris yeah uh-huh and they they forget all about him the oldest daughter they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of oh cute and he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble oh dear so she made him go sleep upstairs uh-huh oh and there is there is a couple of burglars uh breaking into the houses in the neighborhood oh and he hears them or something and and uh yeah and he sets up traps for them all over the house who wins uh he does oh great great yeah i had heard people talk about it and they say it was really cute but i hadn't seen it uh-huh uh we usually wait and eventually eventually it comes out on video and then we get it and see it that way right and that is it movies are very expensive uh movie theatres here they are six dollars uh for evening performances and that is kind of steep uh-huh i think i don't know how much is it in Dallas well it is six dollars and then but you get um matinee prices but yeah you can do that but it is difficult if you if you work or you know uh-huh uh that is taking the middle of the afternoon and if i am looking for entertainment usually i i have more uh time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day to uh see things what do you think of movies in general as far as the as the trends well i think they are a lot better than they used than they were well like um in the early eighties or the during the like the Smokey and the Bandit era uh-huh when it was they i don't think they were very good during that time at least there weren't as many good ones yeah did yeah the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect uh the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a uh-huh a tougher rating which suggests that that you know it will be more enticing to the to the public and a lot of times it is added for no real uh valid reason uh-huh uh which does not make and i think Smokey and the Bandit was a little bit like that yeah uh but Dances With Wolves did not seem to have anything added it was just all legitimate kind of uh film and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many Oscars uh because it really was good even though it is such a long movie you know they said oh people won't won't be interested in a three hour movie but it certainly gotten good acclaim everywhere it has gone and it was shocking at the end too so yeah oh oh yeah absolutely uh but much more true to life and i think that is that is the point yeah that is right uh they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good i hate sequels too i hate these uh you know number one two three four uh-huh uh-huh usually if a movie is good once is enough yeah especially Jaws right that was on Prime Time Television here uh recently at seven thirty in the evening and uh it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie and children young children could see could have seen that movie uh-huh uh at that hour and i thought that you know that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age uh i mean when they were young and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the TV right uh which was a it was a good movie i mean it was well done but uh that is one reason why it was scary uh-huh so but i do not know that i have seen any of the uh sequels to that i think one is enough yeah just more of the same yes uh-huh that is what people say in one of them they have a mother shark uh destroy a whole uh marina and aquarium oh which is kind of far fetched yeah it just a touch yeah well the whole movie is kind of far fetched uh-huh but i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched they hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody not not too often that has gotten to be a whole camp idea idea now though you know if you hear that music you know everybody knows what you are talking about yeah it's funny well it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs well uh every once in a while i go but it it has to be like somebody that i like or yeah you know i did not i did not go see Field of Dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good uh-huh and then when it was i i found out it was Kevin Costner when it was on um i guess ABC the other week then i right yeah i saw it then too yeah and then i really liked it yeah it was good it was very good but uh um uh uh-huh see i have uh teenagers in my house and of course sometimes they rent movies and you know have friends over or something and sometimes movies are here that i did not i am not even aware that i could have seen you know because my family tells me that that that it had been actually in the house before huh but i'd missed it but i did see it on TV and i thought it was good yeah it was really and then and then uh Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player i thought they made him up and then i found out you know after i saw the movie that they they started talking about that scandal and oh really yeah when the when the anniversary came up that was around the time of anniversary and uh-huh no kidding oh i did not realize that then it was on the news yeah uh you know the character that uh James Earle Jones played uh-huh uh uh i teach in school and we are doing a book called Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison uh-huh and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him yeah uh i do not know i had not heard anybody talk about it but uh he certainly could have been uh which was kind of interesting yeah you know someone who uh who was a real activist but then took up the cause uh kind of gave up you know because he didn't think anything was happening and so uh it was kind of fun yeah and i wondered who it was too i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh they were suggesting that this Ben was something of a recluse that he had stopped writing and had stopped you know and that is true for Ellison he he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it huh and uh has pretty much dropped out of public life but he is still alive and that you know that's what makes it so interesting uh-huh and that book have you ever read that book uh i don't Invisible Man what is that Invisible Man Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison uh no huh-uh it is an incredible book it uh really is very very interesting i highly recommend it uh did they make the movies after that or uh the yeah the movie the in Field Field of Dreams came out after uh that novel uh-huh so it it could easily have been patterned after him but the the movie did not have anything to do with with the story that i am talking about but i just thought the actor the uh author could have been patterned after that uh right i mean that that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him certainly uh-huh sort of interesting so well i guess we have talked probably our limit time limit haven't we oh yeah okay very good it was nice talking to you okay it was nice nice talking to you bye-bye okay bye-bye  okay what do you read uh well i read everything uh i guess uh what what's your favorite uh well i like all kinds of in fact i was just reading uh a magazine now an automobile magazine uh i like historical uh books Time magazine newspaper how to how to do it type things uh oh i'm not much into magazines i do read them i like uh Good Housekeeping and stuff like that i'll get ideas out for my own house and yard and stuff main thing i like Pierce Anthony i love Pierce Anthony novels um-hum oh no yeah no i'm not into soap soaps and all that stuff i'm uh not into novels at all really other other than historical things uh uh i'm kind of a a chore person i like to do i'm again i'm i'm fix it person i i read all those kind of things figures what like those uh magazines you get through the mail yeah i'll buy car magazines course i'm an engineer i read the engineering magazines and the money magazines and uh i well i am reading historical uh not not a novel but historical book now about uh uh Russia before uh the the Czar not before the Czar during the Czar's time and what it was like and everything uh-huh what about like those Time books that they put out about uh uh oh ancient discoveries you know the how they found out like that uh ancient man performed performed uh brain surgery successfully stuff like that uh-huh oh you mean the ancient astronauts things i've read some of that i i didn't quite some of that is uh it is very interesting without question i i don't really know that they have the answers in those books that they they make conclusions in them that may or may not be uh-huh yes oh uh-huh true but they're very interesting that that they've what they've discovered oh i like far out facts or whatever i like to read stuff like that but i'm a yeah superficial buff i can't think if they i just superficial i like i like it if it's fun i don't get too into it yeah you are what kind of buff oh okay oh yeah right well i'm kind of a a hobbyist so i i read all those things that uh and being an engineer all those books that would bore everybody else you know how to do things uh-huh yeah well i'm one of those crazy people that reads the directions it always make my wife mad i because you read it when she ever there's something i say well have you read the directions no i hate reading the directions i say well engineers we we are the few people in the world that read the directions yeah you're an engineer are you an engineer for TI yeah okay uh i worked at TI for a little while um-hum uh we've got a book that says uh How Do They Do That and it answers everything yeah oh really yeah and i'll read well not everything but a lot of silly little questions oh yeah that like what makes a firefly light you know oh yeah those are oh interesting oh you like science things uh i haven't gotten them in a long time what is that uh one that's on TV that book uh National Geographic is really a fascinating book uh uh if you ever get those or even now yeah uh-huh well that don't but i haven't gotten them in years uh they they were kind of expensive i know people just collect them like they're yeah uh they have wonderful pictures photographs and just amazing photographs that they've done yeah we used my little sister was blind and going to school and she would have to come home and i cut out different she wasn't fully blind just legally blind um um-hum yeah but she would have to cut out different colors and that is the best book to go through those National Geographics it is it is they they they uh the photographers just got fantastic fantastic pictures in those things uh they're great well now i do like National Geographic and stuff because i like i said i like reading about i don't know animals i love reading about animals um-hum the gorillas and stuff and the sloth it fascinates me yeah that's something moves that slow oh yeah and it's just weird you know i haven't uh of course it was it all books and things or was it anything say anything but newspapers i've forgotten what the question was exactly but uh what do you read i guess in general or oh well yeah well we can talk about anything we want yeah uh i i glance at all newspapers i do like uh since the read since the economy is doing so bad i never have read the uh uh financial pages more often than now you know and trying to analyze and look for some good news in in there you know uh to see if the well for me there's no immediate well what you know the financial page doesn't hit me directly which i'm sure it does if i get into it but like i said i don't keep up on all that well i've only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything i thought well uh see if there's anything in there that uh yeah the uh would be see positive you know you always look for things with this with this terrible recession that we're in uh to see if there's any good yeah with everything going down oh yeah yeah it's uh hopefully uh we'll recover here uh yeah i know i heard Bush say that you know we're either bottoming out or seem to be yeah but that's Bush saying it yeah right and he he yeah i know i don't really know if uh any one person knows uh uh what some of the problems are uh but there're there're some there're some interesting things in the paper really yeah well i like Ann Landers yeah no i like getting the paper and reading the want ads and just i do skim over it it but mainly i'm a front page person i don't go into the details yeah no i glance at it i i with with the uh so much uh you sound like you have a family too but with a family and everything there's just so much going on that i uh actually i'm more of a radio not more of a radio buff but uh it's easier to do when i do some chores or yard work or anything put the radio on and listen to that and well i know at TI they have most of the stuff on the printout don't they i mean on the computer where you can read the daily news oh yeah i do every time i come in uh i'll punch up but they call it T News and all that i i do get uh it gets a little bit of everything even the the last page is uh uh-huh is sport uh listings and and different things uh and world news you know about uh-huh now when i worked you can read it in one minute you know huh when i worked at TI i read that more than i read the regular newspaper um-hum because i would read that every day because you'd find ten minutes here that you don't have anything to do i know you do being an engineer yeah there are sometimes when you've got ten or fifteen or even an hour off yeah not much not in the area i worked in we had an engineer in there every ten minutes yeah yeah so oh yeah it it's it is uh interesting uh with the computer to read the computer news and all that i i guess that's uh that that is a source of reading i hadn't thought about that in that respect uh yeah well it just encouraged me to read it oh yeah yeah it it does have a good uh simple uh you know again you can read it in uh a lot less than ten minutes it's usually you can you you can page through uh-huh yeah i don't read everything on some of the stuff's pretty boring i i skip over some of that but uh uh it is well see that's me with the newspaper especially financial page yeah yeah yeah well i don't uh i read it so less and i watch so little TV i didn't even know what the deal was with this uh oh i i can't remember his name now him and his wife are getting divorced and he's a tycoon or something what is his name oh yeah uh uh Trump Donald Trump yeah yeah Trump i didn't even know i still don't know what the whole deal was with that well i guess because he was so rich you know when you're that rich uh you always get into the paper whatever if you have a family problem whatever well he had a young girlfriend he was he's well into his forties and i guess he got a young girlfriend who uh and uh and then every every time you take you you are that rich you just get uh in the the in the news immediately immediately you know yeah immediately so that's all it was he was just having an affair on his wife uh which is tough well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know huh he was uh uh essentially like you said a tycoon uh Donald Trump and had it all he was high roller for about ten years and then he is now essentially bankrupt you know oh that's got to be hard to go from really rich to poor and so uh he yeah yeah which i'm sure he ain't poor no right uh who knows uh what he's really got but uh he was kind of an arrogant arrogant guy so i think the newsmen uh enjoyed uh writing about him on his way down you know yeah and his wife was very uh uh seemed to be very smart and actually running some of his business it was uh she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his uh did very well huh Ivana Trump uh oh they they've been on all the news and everything in the in the papers and uh on Barbara Walters and everything else well see that's what i said i like i don't watch much TV anymore either hum but i've got three kids so it's hard to watch TV except for Donald Duck oh yeah i can imagine right uh uh i know what you mean really uh well i've enjoyed talking to you okay yeah well uh hang in there and good luck with those kids yeah and have a good holiday bye-bye right bye-bye  okay what you mean my voice yes oh no i am from Kentucky oh well originally so i heard that the topic today was gardening and lawn care uh-huh ooh i know we're about to hit it here a few minutes i figured i could make this call and get it over with we are going to mow and trim and edge that's all we have been doing all weekend oh you know what it seems like we are doing it here forever we bought a a large house that was completely unlandscaped i mean it it was probably probably was up to your shoulder in in thistles that was all that was there and we hired a professional landscaper to do it uh-huh and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted or the plants do not make the winter time and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year um-hum probably through the Fall too and uh rip up rip out all the rest of these junipers or anything that requires uh more care than i am willing to give the kids and replace it with hollies uh how many kids do you have just two okay but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more what year i mean how old are they four and five four and five goodness um-hum i've got a four year old a four year old and a four month old and an eight year old stepdaughter oh well i have a twenty six year old stepson and i do not know if that counts well you do not have to tend to him well i did for many years so yeah oh you did okay it is over with yeah it is over with he is gone but back to gardening are you one of these uh Howard Garrett organic enthusiasts or a Neil Sperry nuke the lawn with chemicals if i can just nuke it i'd do it but i do not i just it is like oh i'll get out there and pull my weeds i do not have a real big front yard but i do have half of it is a flower bed just about all by the porch because the porch is pretty big i live in town um-hum um-hum but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts i do not like it and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff and i just plowed through the whole nine yards got up everything there was some plants that are just spring bloomers and i um-hum the leaf when the blooms died the leaves were just horrible looking um-hum so i just broke all them off it was a hyacinth have you ever seen those oh yes oh they are pretty in the Spring but the leaves i do not like them you know once but all right now are you sure they are hyacinths because that is a bulb yeah it is a bulb well you should of just ripped the whole thing out no because i do like the i like the plant in the Spring i love those pink flowers they are just pretty so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down because i want them to come back up next year have you had is this the first year they have been up yeah well let me tell you they do not come back very well at all maybe they will if up further north but down and you are not that much further north i have probably planted oh around here um maybe six hundred bulbs of hyacinths no i have probably have done hyacinths but i have just learned with from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming oh of everything because they do not take the heat here And if they do come back next year they are going to look real puny oh they will yep hum about the only bloom bulb that repeats well in my area is the uh uh daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb okay now i have got some daffodils and we everybody down here calls these flags uh the irises i guess um they call them flags that is what they call them down here they get uh just one bloom on the plant i do not i am not sure what they are called but i do not much when does it leaf when when does it bloom well i think they are stopped blooming now in the spring it has got gay oh they come in all different colors the blooms are on some of them is yellow purple white just all different colors and what color and you only get one of them well i mean per bulb you get one big flower that looks like a lily i don't know what they are called i have always called them well i don't know what i have called them but when i come down here everybody told me they are flags you know what i bet you they are and i am a pretty i am a pretty good gardener because i have killed a lot of things here and and planted a lot of them and i i work on a uh landscape committee for our neighborhood uh-huh our neighborhood is a planned development with i think it is seven hundred and fifty five families uh-huh but we have about sixteen acres that we have to plant i am going to bet you that is a lily because if it is yeah it is some type of lily and i will get uh is it what color is is yours blooming i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue which i would not would have liked those in the front because they match my porch and stuff better and then some on the side of the house with the dusty purple color with little purple spots that it it will fade into a solid purple and what does the foliage look like does it green spiky leaves now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a a lot higher and it is a bulb oh oh oh oh i bet you those are i bet you what those things are um is a Dutch iris Dutch irises i'll bet you it is a Dutch iris uh-huh does it does it on its little on its on the flower does it have a beard on it at all any kind of fuzzies you know i i really do not know i am going to bet you that that has got to be blooming this time of year it's no they're they've they're died down i am sorry they are dead now they bloom in the Spring well i was just going to correct myself because they would have bloomed pretty early yeah t hey bloomed in the spring well yeah right about after the daffodils right about the same time or after okay i will bet you those are Dutch iris i would took i took and just mowed over them last year um-hum and uh we've been i i do not much care for them after the bloom dies they are not pretty well and to me it just looks like a bunch of leaves but i took them out of my front yard and i just threw them on the side intending to transplant them or throw them away or something yep and forgot about them through the whole Winter well i went out there this Spring and they had took root right where they were on top of each other and they told me that they are the hardest things to you know to kill but they are real easy to grow well ooh does that help well then it is not it is not a Dutch iris then oh gosh i don't i am not sure what it is they said that they are irises it is some type of iris though huh but they call them flags up here or down here down here well i am not so sure that Texans really know what they've what they have got yeah i do not know what it is i'm i'm not on i am just getting into gardening this year did you just move down here uh we moved here a year ago yeah last Spring we moved in here May this house May of last year so it was really too late to do much ooh who who who who because i have got a flower i have got i have probably got do do do do he he i do not know how many square feet it is a big circular driveway the whole uh perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds and oh i am into that and it and it looks quite formal i mean it really does it looks quite formal but it has been about three or four years of uh uh playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here well that well what kind of blue i am wanting blue i want blue and purple and you know just different shades of that because my my house is gray and blue looks so pretty against it you want blue um-hum ooh blue is hard you know do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all Summer i bought well i would like to have one that would bloom next year too that will come back up okay put in a perennial blue salvia now it's going to grow about um the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall and it will send out a flower spike you will see them blooming now it is a wildflower here but you can get them in the nursery uh-huh i am looking for a pen i want to write this down because well that is where i went this year because i waited too late to really plant stuff but i did not know that these hyacinths like i said i do not know anything about plants i did not know the hyacinths hyacinths were going to die yep well the you know nursery men will sell will sell you things here and they are they are kind of in a labor of love the other thing to do if you really really like the hyacinths and i do is that before you plant those bulbs stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them yeah that is what i did with my plants i had bought these uh colossians yep celosias or whatever and they will not grow down here okay perennial huh-uh um-hum blue salvia salvia uh-huh and now that will bloom all Summer long and it will it but it insists on full sun okay i bought me me oh i guess i just went and bought me just about nineteen dollars worth of little buds buds planted uh already grown uh-huh uh-huh and it looks pretty good out there i will tell you another plant that is purply it it it is dark purply kind of a purply blue red it is really a pretty plant uh-huh uh-huh it is sold down here as Purple Buddy now it's not yeah it is not a perennial it is an annual but it will take the heat down here Purple Buddy Purple Buddy Purple Buddy it's proper name is gomphrena how do you spell that G O M P H R E N A gomphrena and is sold as Purple Buddy or sometimes sold as straw flower and they make uh oh about a foot high plant and they send out this this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it but that purple ball okay  okay well i do not know how big a city is Rome i mean you have heard about Dallas and the the crime here is pretty bad well Rome pretty small but uh we hear a lot about uh New York City there is a lot of crime down there and i am i am afraid to go down there because yeah i was going to say uh-huh you know i mean you hear about people getting mugged You leave your car for ten minutes and it is stripped when you come back so yeah have you ever been there no i have not only to the airport that is uh probably enough to see um are you in college right now no i am i work at for the Air Force so there is a base up here and oh okay are base that's interesting interesting concept are bases safe you know bases are pretty safe because they check your ID on your way in and yeah the they uh minimize the access right but even so we had a um um at New Years we had some people come in and uh uh-huh like attack one of the planes because they were protesting uh the presence over in the Persian Gulf oh no sure oh great that's wonderful yeah well Dallas uh we lived in Minneapolis uh we moved here about ten months ago and so Dallas is pretty uh well we live in north Texas north Dallas which is like a suburb near a suburb called Plano so we are out of the city but it is uh it is bad everywhere in terms of uh you know the handgun situation um the number of rapes the number of muggings just it's it's i would not say it is not as bad as New York but it is pretty scary you know people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods and you know they call them ornamental grates but they are still bars yeah yep that makes it bad for getting out during a fire yeah it really does and if you're a little bit claustrophobic but uh i don't know i mean the jails are crowded i i i'm not a criminal justice specialist so i don't know what you know what can be done i'm i don't i don't know it seems to i think it is getting worse because i keep hearing things like i when i was home i went home my parents live in Boston but i went home and we were watching TV and you know uh-huh this thing came on where these a group of like five or six guys went and filmed themselves beating up people in the street and and robbing them and it was really disgusting and my mom was like they should just be all shot right now and oh i mean you hear were they teenagers or like that girl in New York that got beat up by you know when she was jogging in Central Park a couple of years ago um yeah yeah um they weren't i think they were early twenties they were young men huh yeah but they so they weren't you know and were they uh were they were they obviously poor or deprived you know that is really strange sick i know and how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder those are a thousand bucks yeah unless they stole it and i mean that is one big thing down here i mean they have like uh and they are not all young i mean they are eighteen to twenty four some of the young men and women but i mean you can you can see the Crime Stoppers ads on television or sometimes it's the same people that have been that have been observed and they still can't catch them yeah and you are wondering how you know um we lived in Minneapolis and Wisconsin i mean there was all kind of i i know i i i know it is getting worse i do not know what the world is or is not um the in a small town in Wisconsin near Madison um a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun and killed his parents and his three brothers and sisters uh-huh and the child had and he they said that he was twelve years old and he had uh he had not uh displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever you know and you are thinking to yourself um i know yeah i wonder where i do not know i wonder where he gets it you know you must i think TV is bad because they uh show all sorts of violence on that and i don't think a lot of parents i mean i don't i don't know how it is in the Air Force base but uh i just don't think a lot of people because of the economy both need to work you know i just don't think a lot of parents are that involved any more yeah they don't they don't talk to their kids and take them out and and aren't there all the time so the kids are off to their own devices a lot right and discipline i do not know how your folks were but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that uh my parents were oh definitely the superior and i was the subordinate and you know it was sort of like there were boundaries and i do not think i do not know i think today a lot of parents um are ruled by their kids i i i think so definitely when you go to a restaurant like kids are running all over the place they yeah right i mean they're not learning such as well like boundaries i mean i don't i see it in work place too sometimes i do not know how old you are but you sound a little bit younger than me but i am in my thirties and i i i see um even people that work with me that are ten years younger that you know they kind of have an attitude that i hate i i hate to say it but it's that's just what it is it is an attitude like the world owes them something yep but right i i see that too in the Air Force especially oh yeah a lot of uh especially since a lot of us are engineers where i work do you are you in the Air Force okay i'm in the Air Force and so people outside the Air Force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do and so all the young engineers are like well i am just going you know get it for all it is worth and that you know and i am like you are the one who signed up if you did not want to do it and sure right right right and the Air Force is one of the bitter better military supposedly military military experiences i mean yep it is i like it but uh pardon me i like it so far i mean that is are you going to be a career person i'm digressing but i don't talk to many people in the military so i am oh probably not but um they pay for my college so that's the way to do it i mean and that's you know at least the Air Force is i don't know i just um i am nervous in Dallas i mean i you know i mean i go to like an aerobics class or something you know i um seventy women in your average size exercise class in a public um parks and rec building and you are supposed to feel safe but then there are all these it doesn't matter race but you know it's an inter-racial mix and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards leotards yep and i do not even think that way but i mean you just think to yourself you you just i mean nobody can think that that it can't happen to them no matter who they are or where they are at you know it yeah and you never know who is watching either i mean did you i do not know i was in the grocery store this morning we um went to New Orleans for four days and came back late last night driving it's about seven hours um and that's a very we had never been there that's a very very neat town to visit uh in terms of the French Quarter and all of th e things you hear about but the crime is so bad there uh-huh right i mean in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do how to carry your wallet um uh-huh this is New Orleans oh i'd hate to be there during Mardi Gras let New Orleans yeah i would never yeah you just don't don't even bother it's not worth it uh the when we came back i don't know if you have seen i was in the super market this morning and on the cover of Time magazine there is a girl she is in Boston she is on the east coast somewhere real attractive young girl college freshman i college coed i think she is a freshman she'd been dating a fellow for several weeks and they went back to her dorm room and date rape i mean and it just uh-huh uh-huh she she looked anguished i mean it was really just sad i mean didn't pick it up and read it but i should have but i just looked at the picture and thought what a world i know i mean i do not yeah i do not have any uh cure you can't trust anybody it's it's really scary no you really can't i mean i they we lease out a really nice two story town home in North Dallas and they have a real big thing here people i mean even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting you know they everybody wants your business kind of thing and my husband is the kind of guy he's right he's sometime he was raised on a farm in southern Ohio near Dayton and think sometimes it is just he and i are very different in terms of that i i mean i basically have started not to trust anybody in general street smarts right and uh he opened the door i came downstairs and i was real upset and i probably got more nasty than i should have but i just said Howard you know oh my God i would not i mean well you you hear about people opening the door and getting blown away or people you know oh yeah And it does i mean it is it is not a reason i mean i have been to New York You shouldn't deny yourself going to visit and all that uh-huh uh but it is not any worse i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by uh are you from Boston yeah Home Owners Savings and Loan in Boston and i know i never felt uh-huh i mean i've been to downtown New York City and i've been to downtown Boston and i never felt any safer on Milk Street in Boston staying at the Meridian i didn't pay for but i mean i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city in any other city i have been in you know right so i would say one thing do not deny yourself the New York experience but experience but go with people that you know yeah i wouldn't want to go by myself no uh but i mean it yeah i don't know i mean i i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals uh i think the handgun i'm not real big on guns myself so i mean uh-huh i think our justice system needs to be stricter i mean because everyone they do it and then they get out in a couple of years it seems like are the New York uh are the New York i do not know how the New York state prison system is but they are booked up yeah are they booked up that is a way to put it they are booked up Are they paroling uh like murderers and i mean here it is just a real big deal they parole people that have killed police officers and then they are out doing it again right um i do not i do not know because i am not real up on a lot of news things but you know you just hear about that that you know it is a lot of repeat crime uh-huh uh-huh and you are like why are they repeating they should have been in there longer or i know and then you think i mean i have i mean i can remember i haven't been out of school that long but it has been at least ten years and you think to yourself was it that bad back then or is it just i think that like you said television is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it you know i mean people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something it seems like a lot of it that it is more like in Boston there was a case of uh a couple of kids fifteen year olds they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone so they they picked on this kid who was like new in town and they were like well no one was going to miss him anyway uh-huh you know and it like ugh that is horrible how can you even think like that oh God it it is yeah isn't it something i mean i i have a i am originally from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania and i have a niece and nephew and i just um i mean my ten year old nephew says things that he is aware of that i am just going Michael how did you hear about that you know it is just i think kids get too much too fast and all those sort of things in Atlanta where my inlaws live um they had that thing you know the high top sneakers the Air Jordans et cetera yeah right kids killing each other and beating their brains out you know right or the or the jackets the team like the Raiders and the caps you know stealing the hundred dollar jackets um oh for the sneakers yeah yep i mean it is i guess it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that they in Boston that is crime where they videoed that is probably one of the most bizarre i have heard of where they videotape themselves yep yeah it seems like a crime is turning into a pastime instead of like you know be  well where what what's good in Washington DC to eat well i think we're very fortunate because um in the past twenty years Washington has really developed a a good number of quality restaurants um mostly although you have your normal continental we've gotten the excellent excellent ethnic restaurants um we have Ethiopian restaurants we have Latin American restaurants um you know besides the normal range of French and Italian and things like that so uh we try to experience because i am Italian background and my husband is Chinese we really try to uh experience quite a bit of difference in cooking styles well you have a lot to thank your husband for noodles oh God yeah but i live in a great place i live in Berkeley California in what they call the gourmet ghetto it's uh uh-huh it's it's it's got every well it's it's a very uh polyglot community you know got every every kind of ethnic background you can think of but um-hum just up the street is one of one of one of only two five star restaurants on the east coast less than a block i mean on the West Coast i think there's only like four in the US but oh my well what uh-huh is it continental uh well no it's French actually it it is French uh-huh it she uh yeah yeah the the name of it is Chez Penny you may have heard of it but they uh they they they specialize in flower salads actually uh-huh and i'm sure it's quite i'm sure it's quite pricey and they got you know well actually it's like thirty five dollars for the meal and that's you know and each night is a different that that there's never the same meal twice oh so it's a price fixed and you go in for the menu that they have they yeah and you go in you know and of course it's booked for months on end yeah yeah but they also have a um a uh i understand a buffet or something that you know people can just walk in oh that's interesting uh-huh you know combination this is like during the day what kind of food do you like oh good any specific any specific time oh no no no i'm one of those people that as long as it's good it really doesn't matter and and you're adventuresome oh extremely yeah i was one of those kids that would go into a menu go into a restaurant when i was a kid and and and would not order unless i had never had it before um-hum uh-huh uh-huh well we're very fortunate we have we have two sons and ever since they were even even very little they we very adventuresome i mean they tried frogs legs an and they tried rabbit and all sorts of things so uh we've never had to have the problem of picky eaters well it's oh i was a i was a picky eater when i was real young but then i got to the point where i discovered that you know and um-hum there was something other than than Twinkies in the world oh well they they've been they've been adventuresome since they were i mean even preschoolers they'll they tried anything oh that's great yeah so um it's been fun it's been great and uh of course in the area of Maryland where we are of course crabs are one of our big delicacies oh i know i know i i used to live back in North Carolina and i remember going to up to to Richmond James River and we'd get and and flounder you don't we don't get flounder out here on the West Coast and uh-huh uh-huh oh i know but you get some other kinds of fish that are just wonderful i know that you have abalone out there yeah that's that's true that's true and fresh i there's nothing to rely i mean fresh abalone is wonderful yeah it really is a lot of work but it's it's good really is yes yes but uh you know Baltimore also is a wonderful eating city uh yeah Baltimore Baltimore i saw a movie about Baltimore recently Abalon that's right i'm okay okay and Baltimore's got some great dining areas it's got little ethnic communities little pockets of ethnicity in the city and it's absolutely marvelous the it's sort of one of these underrated cities and they're some great restaurants there uh-huh um it there are mostly um besides the little ethnic things you've got your great seafood places and there's one great German restaurant there called Hausners the owners of which um traveled all over the world and this place is room after room of art so that you feel you're in a museum except it's completely over done and it's it's a real place to bring people for something to talk about and it's a very German restaurant they've got the whole gamut of German dishes huh so uh when we go out i guess we look as you said you like to try when you were young something different we try to go out for either two things something to make it a festive occasion and to try something very unusual or else we go back to a few of our uh for Chinese restaurants we usually follow the chef if we know the chef's in a restaurant and what their specialties are so there are certain Chinese restaurants this is something i learned from my husband where you only eat certain things sure and uh other things that they don't produce in you know in quality but other aspect other Chinese restaurants you would eat other things so uh we we do tend to eat out at least once a week sometimes more although with two sons in college now that may be it may be a little less yes well uh uh of of course without two two sons it's it's it's also easier to go out isn't it i mean yes really you know i mean it certainly is so uh what's what's your major consideration when you go out to dinner well uh basically it it's it's it's it's good food and and uh price comes into it some you know not not um-hum yeah which would so it's fun to find good food for a reasonable price too yeah well that's what's really great about where i live here it's in in an area that's within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants i'm not kidding it's just uh um-hum oh that's oh well how tempting it's in you know it's just just down from the from um University of California Berkeley and uh and it's um-hum and that that's what's good about it is that the the the the prices are extremely reasonable and the competition is so keen that the food really is good so you know you yeah yeah we have to we have to drive any restaurant where we're not in walking area of any even a store so we do have to drive but within you know within a um fifteen twenty minute drive we have a whole span of of restaurants that we can chose from and unless you go into downtown Washington and the elegant areas uh even the some of the areas in Washington you can get very reasonable and very tasty meals and uh one one more time what was the name of that restaurant in Baltimore the German Hausners Hausners i'll Hausners H A U S N E R S um-hum have to remember that well Linda it's been a pleasure talking to you yeah if you ever get out there well i enjoyed talking with you too all right bye-bye all right you have a good one bye-bye  how has your weather been recently well the last two weeks we have had records yes uh we've been we've had between ninety and ninety five degree weather with about eighty six to eighty eight percent humidity record what oh wow that's something we've had a really wonderful Spring it's been rainy yeah it's been comfortable it been cool and we've only had a couple of really severe weather storms uh which is unusual for northeast Texas generally we have some um-hum you know there's there's always at least one or two good hail storms before the season ends yeah i know what you mean by good hail storms yeah last Thursday though it was just raining buckets and it was probably in the low eighties hm it was really a nice late Spring day very comfortable just really was nice had plenty of rain and within three days time all of that moisture is gone the sun has come out and it is H O T i mean big time hot the air conditioners in the buildings are saying oh no not again um-hum hm oh yes i know unfortunately my air conditioner broke down uh two days ago so uh things have been like a sauna uh um-hum um-hum i can imagine well uh typically though what does your weather run when does your Spring actually start well it's pretty Spring usually starts uh in May um-hum and we usually have seventy degree weather to seventy to eighty degree weather in May and in June and then uh toward the end of June it starts getting hot and uh hot um-hum um-hum meaning you know ninety and above i consider ninety and above hot uh and we usually have about the same humidity but unfortunately uh we had a very early Summer i'm i'm hoping that we'll um-hum um-hum yeah again maybe get some cool weather but uh i don't know uh it it doesn't look very encouraging because they're calling for the rest of the week to be equally as hot so oh wow right oh boy i know that it's been about eight years ago i guess now right here in Dallas so i guess it was late May temperatures got up into the nineties and by early June it was rocking a hundred and it stayed that way till September hm we had ninety one consecutive hundred degree days oh my gracious wow and i didn't know whether we would survive at all oh but oh i guess not that's you don't have as much humidity though do you uh well actually you know we affect our humidity a great deal this at one time wasn't a real humid area but we've built a lot of lakes and a lot of reservoirs and that increases the relative humidity i mean it if it's there to evaporate it's going to go up into the air and the hotter it gets the more evaporates um-hum right um probably put in more trees and things too uh might uh uh it seems like the area there more treed seemed to um uh hold the humidity in uh even more well we have attempted to reforest some areas but as a matter of fact at one time this was uh a very dense forest in this area and for farming and for construction and things a lot of the forests have been cut down and then of course you know they bulldozed a bunch of forest when they dug out the reservoir moisture yes i know oh but for the most part we have very mild Winters here we may get one snow storm i may actually see white on the ground one day but if it even ices over a half an inch worth of ice or just a little bit of snow man businesses close down traffic comes to a snarl i mean nothing happens if it gets enough snow you can see it on the ground well don't feel bad it does here too and we get snow all the time uh they don't get that awfully much but they get enough unfortunately that uh uh if if they aren't used to it it's not like having um oh yeah uh-huh right snow two you know uh three to five inches all the time or quite quite often they seem to be able to handle it when they have it like that but here uh the schools close when there's half an inch of snow and uh right yeah oh yeah that's true they sure do everything else closes down so uh um-hum well you know the one of the things i have noticed is that the weather changes over time as well i was raised in Amarillo um-hum and i can remember when there was really only one snow storm a year in Amarillo it started in October and stopped in March or May April and it you know there stayed snow on the ground all Winter long to to sun depth right but actually that has changed considerably uh the the Winters are no less cold but they're dryer right right yes it's been the same way here uh we haven't had nearly as severe uh a Winter in the last five years even um-hum than we had uh i've been in Maryland for twenty years so uh um i'd i'd say when i first came here you know it it was quite um-hum common to have several snows and uh you know they they build in uh ten snow days for our kids back here in the school and uh the last three years they haven't taken but one day um-hum um-hum right oh wow that's something well i don't think there was a single day out this year for our kids they i don't they don't put ten in there i think they put three so uh it has um-hum but good grief here three days for snow days actually one year before last they took a snow day because it was flooding uh Spring flood and they just couldn't get to school so they just canceled school okay right so there's just too many we're in a a very uh they're low hills you don't notice them because of the trees and because of the so many buildings built around but there's a lot of hills around here which means there's a lot of gullies which means there's a lot of creeks and a lot of flooding right right right right and uh that can create almost as big a hazard and i drive a little Nissan when it floods it drowns ooh yes right you wouldn't wanna you wouldn't want to go through too many puddles do you have much uh many many problems problems with um lightning uh with electric storms there well yes uh anytime there's a storm there's going to be plenty of it yeah one of the oh really okay because of that that's one thing that we have here see i'm originally from California so the contrast between uh-huh the lightning storms i experienced there and the lightning storms back here where it hits in the back yard you know uh uh have been uh quite an experience but um yeah right uh we seem to have a lot this time of year we seem to have a lot of uh where it's still i mean last night it went down to sixty degrees but it's ninety it's it's eighty two right now here so uh yeah ooh goodness it really did climb fast didn't it yes so it the the contrast in the Spring is so uh you know different i guess that it uh breeds some uh well i am a little bit concerned this last week our temperatures not drop down below the upper seventies at night which means that you you know we could be looking for a very warm Summer i really don't want that um-hum yeah no i don't either i know what you mean because electric bills go up and in fact uh i was at my daughter's on Sunday and they had their first brown out uh it just electricity just went off for about twenty minutes and then came back on oh um but it went off in the whole neighborhood so uh uh it's this isn't uh oh my goodness this is still May it's not a real good time of year to start you know because uh uh it kind of looks for the but the the Summers have been longer and um hotter um-hu m that's right i think that a lot of it has to do with i agree  some of the the more recent uh changes that i've noticed in society is i guess over the last ten to twenty years or maybe the technological advances you know ten to twenty years ago there wasn't a VCR in every home and there wasn't uh oh i know the remote control was a great big box that was connected to the back of the TV some some of the uh that's true yeah and the old remote controls that were all by sound and you could drop a coin or clang some dishes and turn off the TV or change channels and all the things that have changed over the years yeah but along with that i unfortunately i guess there's been a down side to a lot of that stuff i mean another three or four years you're going to have a land fill full of VCR's that and the parts and things that don't work and um-hum a lot of those things just don't go away and uh i guess the environmentalists have done their jobs that ten to twenty years ago i didn't think of it that much i knew about all the the uh organizations that tried to do that for a living you know let you know what what environmental impact was but just kind of recently uh the world's waking up to that so that's a change that's come along yeah you got to well let's see you i guess you grew up in the you were a teenager in the seventies right okay did you go to like Woodstock and all that yeah yeah no no never got around as it were but i uh i paid attention to it all being there so that that has changed people are uh i think the the outspoken people people who make a difference and make a change that age has come down it seems like uh you can make a difference at a younger age these days you don't have to be a an older part of the establishment to make waves no like that one little girl that wrote who did she write oh i think she was in some kind of a airplane crash seem like it was an eleven year old girl wrote Gorbachev Gorbachev or Noriega or someone oh yeah yeah i thought that was a lot it's true they can uh they can make quite a difference at no matter what the age nowadays plus there seems to be uh uh there's a few negative changes that have come along i was just thinking last night how different uh my kids' childhood is from uh when i grew up i i was allowed pretty much a free rein around my house to ride my bike uh you know all several blocks away even at the age of of ten or eleven years old i could ride uh-huh a couple of miles away i'd ride to school you know and it was it was right at two miles away from the house uh-huh but it's just not safe anymore whereas here uh yeah i won't let them go you know more than a block out of my sight there i'm just a little too paranoid these days with what's going on and uh hum-um um-hum yeah we get you know reports from the police will give us warnings about this neighborhood and some activity that's occurring there and then you know occasionally it works its way around to our neighborhood and we have to keep a real close rein on them won't even let them go out of our sight for a while and then uh-huh how after they catch that guy you know you can let him go out for a while but it's uh it's kind of sad well how old are your kids i've got a nine year old and a seven year old and uh they both like to ride their bikes off into never never land and you know be okay right well we used to ride around well i guess it would be a city block um-hum my mom didn't mind i wouldn't dream of letting my little boy take off yeah i used to uh i grew up in kind of a good combination of between the country and the city um-hum uh in East Texas and i had while we were in town we'd ride several miles away like to school and the like but when we were in the country we would ride ten twelve miles away we'd spend a whole day just two or three of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and come back and you know as long as we told the parents what roads we were going to be on and if there any um-hum trouble was they could come find us but uh can't do that now just no safe place to let your kid go that long and of course it probably wasn't that good of an idea back then either it just uh hum-um well no but back even when i was growing up it wasn't drugs wasn't as now drugs was pretty bad but they weren't near as bad as they are now um-hum and this child abuse wasn't as bad as it is now either right and there's uh so many missing kids you know they they're saying that the uh uh the education is going to be enough or at least a major part of the drug deterrment and though i remember when i was in school they had a a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the science classes and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff but that was nothing compared to the you know campaigns that are going on now but i guess it's just the the class of people or the area that we're in but i i'm not in contact with any kids that think it's it's it's it's a positive thing to do i mean it is it is really looked down upon even to the point of smoking i mean that kids are so ingrained uh-huh that they look down on them we have to tell them you know don't say anything in public to a stranger about his smoking you know not not quite that's not quite accepted yet now if he's in a nonsmoking area you might want to say something but well they uh they're so outspoken on the topic that uh it's an interesting change in attitudes yeah that is because there's coming coming along with the education even in my time smoking was just cool yeah all the cool people did it yep went outside but my stepdaughter's getting like that and that's pretty hard because her granny smokes and we smoke so it yeah it won't take but a like uh maybe generation or so before it uh it it no longer the cool thing to do i don't know oh yeah have a smoke free hopefully hopefully we can get away from it yeah really it's quite an expense too now they keep deciding that's the thing to tax yeah they do it's what about two dollars a pack now yeah it keeps going up and up well i guess there's uh it's i don't know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on that realm and Russia's no longer the major enemy and well who is the major enemy now i i don't know if there is one one easy one to uh to pick that's part of the problem i don't when i was growing up i was scared of Red China yeah yeah now everybody told me that they had the biggest Army in the world which i guess they still do because they probably still do as far as humans go yeah because China's real densely populated unless they of course there you wouldn't be able to go over and attack them but i don't know that they'd be able to go anywhere and attack us they can't get all those people across the sea they don't have the ships to get them anywhere so they may have a huge army but it's going to stay put yeah hm uh it's kind of an interesting uh interesting problem not having any one enemy to focus on as a society tends to uh let that go out of the mind you're no longer concerned with the the weapon systems and the the defense area so now that Russia's gone as a major focused on enemy uh that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to people's lives so that's an an interesting social change i guess yeah course it'll surprise them some day when when all the hostilities start back up and some people aren't prepared for it so oh i don't think anybody was prepared for this last war  are you a computer professional uh well i would like to call myself that yes but i'm sure there's always something new to learn because we have a growing growing uh computer world out out there but are you working at the Texas Instruments or are you at home no i'm at uh Texas Instruments um-hum okay uh what's what's your application for PC's oh golly numerous uh application presentations uh memos uh uh spreadsheets um just all kinds of things oh okay i don't do any plotting though i don't do any you know i don't do any uh device creations or anything like that um-hum like in AutoCAD i don't do those but we have that capability here oh okay well i got involved in uh computers because i have an interest in speech recognition uh-huh which is probably why i got involved in the TI switchboard project um-hum that's been ongoing for quite a while now is the speech recognition it's uh i don't know how old it is but i know they've been pursuing it for a long time and will probably be pursuing it for a long time to come that's right yes a lot of uh glitches to get out of it to work out of it uh-huh yeah well i bought a uh PC oh well i bought a series of personal computers of one kind or another but the latest one i bought for the children to use uh for their educational games and and for entertainment games and i soon discovered that it was running faster than the IBM PCAT that i had purchased to do my uh uh postgraduate studies oh that's interesting isn't it so i've uh i've taken over the children's computer oh my word and uh enhanced with uh uh uh Texas Instruments DSP board um-hum and i'm using it for uh speech recognition research at this point well that's wonderful how are you advancing on your uh endeavors well i've gotten to the point where the program will phonetically label a sentence that i speak into the microphone well great that sounds good and uh it's it's just now up and running in that mode and i've got to make a lot of improvements and uh improve my models and um-hum adjust coefficients and try to improve the performance a little bit but the first results look promising yeah well that's wonderful that's wonderful now if we can get everybody together that has got all these uh uh new inputs that they're doing for speech and if if they could get them together and compare notes they probably would do well to jump a couple hundred feet in that area i think we're getting to the point now where uh there's a lot of people who've done research in a lot of individual areas and we're sort of entering the phase now where i think we're starting to pull some of these results together and getting them to work together um-hum well that's good do you have do you have a group that uh you can interface with each other like uh who's interested in speech well not really uh but that wouldn't be a bad idea though do you think that well my company has has expressed an interest and they've asked me to do a lot of research so uh-huh i've been traveling around the company country talking to uh different groups i spent uh three or four days in Boston earlier this year talking to MIT and uh Bobrank and um-hum and a place named Sonotek uh just to find out what their state of the art is and i see what's out there that can all be brought to bear on the problem and i think the focus of my dissertation is to uh to look at four different uh technologies that have already been researched and see if i can't make them work together in synergy to to get a step ahead right um um-hum um-hum and uh so i think that's probably the way things will go in the future they'll they'll they'll start pulling together the different aspects of speech recognition i would say that there will be well there'll certainly be a lot of commercial products on the market in the next five years um-hum um-hum and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century so it's that that soon yeah uh there'll probably be some you know reasonable breakthroughs in terms of uh bringing products to market um-hum it's going to be interesting to uh uh look at i'm not involved in it myself you know but uh just hearing what is going on at TI is very uh fascinating um-hum and i don't know that much about it i know that um in the group that i was working in there was an area that was really focused on speech recognition however i'm not in that uh organization any more within TI i'm in uh a different area of TI now working on something totally different um-hum so uh my interest was spurred and then it was uh taken away because i i um was moved out of that area yeah yeah i think it's an interesting field and oh it's definitely very fascinating my primary interest is in speech understanding uh-huh uh so once we get the the basic word recognition or something resembling word recognition um-hum uh my interest is in extracting the understanding and in developing uh man machine dialogue type operations like intelligent tutoring systems that uh the tutoring system can sort of gain some insight into what the student knows or doesn't know and modify it's tutoring program accordingly oh that's wonderful and uh getting the interactive speech is a key part of that that's like almost giving them a um evaluation but right and going into the direction where they're gifted in um-hum that's wonderful well it's it's all of parallels techniques that teachers ordinarily use during the day they they're teaching a grade stool grade school student to add and subtract they they pose problems for them and they see where they make their mistakes in in carrying or uh in borrowing or something like that and they then pose problems which will um um-hum um-hum you know point out the proper procedure and then test them again to see that they've learned that fact and so that's that's where the artificial intelligence comes in is is in developing that kind of an art in a machine well you're you sound like you're very current with all that information uh i know it because you have children too and you're also interested in the uh uh voice recognition it's been so long since my my children my grandchildren are in school now but i don't have to worry about them any more just worry about your children huh and uh let let the let the parents worry about the about their babies right but you just know that their doing well so but i don't have any idea what's going on in the schools today hm i'm not active in any school other than paying my school taxes  okay well uh what's your opinion about capital punishment well Cathy i think that uh capital punishment certainly has has a place in our society um maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated uh even even in the remote chance of repetition right i think i would agree with you on that too i i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation uh keeping them you know paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped that might be true um um what i don't know is where do we draw the line right uh do we say that everyone who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime uh or do we extend it uh beyond that uh-huh beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder well either you know uh i have a a nine year old daughter and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes that that i would consider basis for murder yeah yeah well that really gets into into a sticky issue uh i could see that too i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for but gosh and and who's going to decide which is how bad you know something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me and yeah it's gets into a pretty sticky issues yes it does uh a lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and and uh to what's allowable and and where are we right uh you know if we were lived in a different country then murder is not so bad yeah but over here where we're promised the civil liberties of pursuit life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away is a a heinous act yeah in some eyes i think some people give up that i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than think what most people think of them as i don't know what um Texas's criteria for capital murder is do capital punishment is do you know are there some set guidelines like only under these circumstances i don't know i believe it's uh at the discretion of the judge or or jury uh-huh i used to live in Virginia and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only um if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty which i think is a little too limited i tend to agree with you there um my belief is that is that uh any crime that's freely committed you know freedom of choice these these people had a choice of committing this crime um-hum that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life yeah such as rape deserves punishment by death but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person yeah in general terms i'm not so harsh but then whenever i hear of a specific case you know where someone did something then it's it's like yeah put it to them so i i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh too as far as that goes because yeah i think you're right that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life just because you know they they ruin someone else's life oh i i can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food right than a person who commits a crime to uh either for the thrill of committing the crime or the thrill the feeling of power that they get from it or to acquire drugs for some other i mean acquire funds for some other illegal activity um-hum you know that second group of people falls into the the group that i say give up their rights the the first guy i you know i just assumed that it was a guy the first person that that went out to rob a store for food that to me is is a different set of circumstances where he he deserves help instead of uh the loss of life right yeah he didn't go out with the intent of hurting someone else that's right or with the or with no regard for someone else's well being what about uh like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that say fifteen sixteen year old would you consider uh capital punishment for them i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen uh-huh there's some and and i certainly don't know myself but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the the consideration of of long term consequences right yeah what age that they're accountable for their actions begins you know i i have an eighteen year old and uh it well he's nineteen now and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year uh and i have an eleven and eleven year old and a nine year old and i don't don't see it in them yet but i'm i'm not sure where it begins yeah i know that they are lowering the age of uh whatever is considered a minor i think the kids certain kids are have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be like i think i read about a boy that was nine or ten that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them and they were trying to charge him as as a  okay now you can tell me what you do uh well i work with computers just like your son uh-huh and i actually do research in speech recognition oh great and so as part of the reason i'm participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes but um uh-huh uh-huh i was working well actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se uh-huh uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but uh-huh yeah well the one John works for seems to have a lot you know good benefits and the pay is decent um-hum yeah the uh well actually where i was working with the company one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive because we're we're paying our own insurance right now uh-huh uh-huh uh um-hum um-hum um-hum for it um and i'm we actually had a little baby so i'm taking a little bit of a time off from work ah congratulations oh great i had i had a granddaughter and um so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits because it's more important with a family and you know our doctor's visits routine doctor's visits covered my health insurance only covers um right your emergency care and so um-hum do you have major medical benefits right yeah but i don't that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is right well my our deductible is five hundred but it's for each each person yeah that's pretty hard that's pretty high event yeah right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick it doesn't cover right that's that's right that's doctor's visits things like that and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too oh yeah it certainly is yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not um um-hum wow not very good um-hum but it's a it's a type of area we live in of course living expenses aren't as bad either though which makes a difference and probably the medical care care is less expensive too well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh um-hum uh so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower uh well from what i've seen from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here they're not that much different well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan uh-huh is that right and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston uh-huh oh that's a big difference and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but that's a huge difference just between uh-huh uh-huh you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable oh yeah should be so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that i'm really concerned about and most companies don't have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have yes uh-huh you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and i'd go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is and it'd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too um-hum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know and i it would be more convenient more productive i think uh-huh and uh it it's it's i don't know how they do it i really don't you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and all the preparations and your and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that um-hum um-hum and that to me well that you know those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with um-hum um-hum life insurance and uh retirement plans but oh i don't know i think those benefits you mentioned mentioned sometimes they're even more important than you the wage itself yeah if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times right because you're you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that it's worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that uh-huh um-hum um-hum oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better you know everything else being equal because your life would be so much easier and there's a question of quality of life also uh-huh uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on what's going on probably you know with your child yep right and you you you don't feel like you're a half hour away if she something happened right yeah and you're less preoccupied with it i think right yeah so but unfortunately there aren't i think IBM has started having that in certain locations i don't know my daughter one daughter works for MCI and they don't they where she works they don't have anything like that uh-huh is that locally uh Pittsburgh uh-huh Pittsburgh Pennsylvania yeah because Pittsburgh's a big enough city too but you know i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones um-hum um-hum um-hum just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and yeah things like that because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies uh-huh like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week um-hum and um you know call call my own days call my own hours and oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah yeah and and you know which many times at a large company it's almost impossible um-hum um-hum to do things like that they say you're going to do it this way and that's the way it's going to be yeah right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and you're not allowed two weeks and one day um-hum yeah yeah yeah and so it all depends on what your position is there too true well that's true in any any company i think yeah uh i've i've never well i can't say i've never i've maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home you know out of the home um-hum uh-huh but uh the rest of the time i've been an Avon lady and a lady was that when you were um well those have its pluses and minuses too i've been a consultant recently and so i don't have any benefits at all and uh-huh um-hum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they uh-huh uh-huh usually consultants make very good income right and they they refuse to give him more salary is that right because they say they can't pay more than this and that and they're not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so it's new it's harder to get uh oh uh-huh uh-huh the uh your increases and things but um um-hum a consultant consultant consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else you know so it stands to reason they should really have have more benefits yeah well the right well he's been doing a long term he's being called a consultant and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place uh-huh uh-huh and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits he doesn't get well we don't care about retirement benefits he doesn't get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that um um-hum get factored into somebody else's salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know it's a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum yeah and they'll do it  okay is uh that a sport you like to participate in no actually i'm a spectator and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's or my late late husband's interest in golf uh-huh my husband likes golf also he's uh i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it but he he limits it pretty good i um have tried to go out and play golf he would love it if i would go out and play with him but i stand there and swing and swing and i can't even hit the ball yeah i don't either um-hum i can't even play miniature golf well well there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not but i am very good at watching it on television right um-hum and he was really uh enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held and what the nature of the hole was and oh so he's really into it wow oh yeah he was a good golfer and as and did some you know instructions at the country club for a while oh but uh golf tended to be so i am not really deeply involved in any following any of the sports but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players yeah right more because of their personalities than their sportsman uh-huh well part of it was the personality and their sportsmanship another part of it was i'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for so you know the competitor and i became involved in following his career right and uh i know that that my husband Tom Kite was his fair haired boy and he thought he was spectacular i said whoa i'm not going to i'm not going to stay interested in him so oh i decided Andy Bean was good competition any time they both played why he was just real excited when Tom was you know shown on the television and uh-huh i followed Andy Bean uh-huh we both followed Lee Trevino into the Seniors oh he's interesting i like to watch him yeah he is he is a character not just a golfer but he's quite a character yeah and there are some really really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models yes yeah i think you're right and i think it's critical it's critical to have a good role model yeah in any field any sports yeah yeah i like to watch those skins games do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amount you know for each hole they win they get the money for it i think those are pretty exciting uh-huh uh-huh well i myself really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf you hit a little ball you chase it you go find it and then you hit it again and lose it again uh-huh and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier yeah oh really i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated and mad at themselves when they don't do well oh i know oh yeah my husband and his buddies are not very good they play like maybe once a month or less and uh so they all hit like in the low nineties and they think they're having a really good game so um-hum um-hum oh yeah well my husband's average ran in the mid seventies so he wasn't bad wow yeah that is good he was pretty good but as far as influencing young people i think that that is uh that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age you can't play football at fifty five right but it is a good healthy wholesome lifestyle and uh anything can be warped yeah but i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to to move into maturity safely um-hum um-hum uh-huh something to stay active at and for a long time that's right that's right and a lot of seniors a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're you know in their later years yeah yeah yeah and they can still get good at it that's right that's absolutely right and it's something that yeah well maybe that's what i'll do when i have time later on yeah when you're too old to do anything else go play golf yeah but it's it's also something that husband and wife can participate in yeah um-hum or you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles true you know you can go to the country club together you can play with your friends he can play with his friends but you've both been out and exercised and you have enjoyed the day right yeah or my favorite just ride around in the cart with him go somewhere really nice like Hawaii and just look at the golf course you bet you get a lot of exercise that way um-hum well i'll tell you what if if they're not real good golfers sometimes it is not fun to ride around and listen to their exclamations all day long oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch um-hum oh mine had a very short fuse if he did something bad he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it he's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls i mean just get so mad he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal oh no yeah gosh now my husband has a temper but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course he's because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that and how immature immature he thought it was and stuff so i guess he's real laid back about it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh he he'll come home though and i mean he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds and he'd tell me what a great day he had and about this great shot he made and everything i try not to laugh yeah this one on this one hole uh-huh well i shot in the hundreds but i made this one good one did you have to listen to long stories about how on the seventeenth hole i hit it and went this way those are it's hard for me to act nice about that when he goes on and on um-hum well the one thing that is a is a drawback about it i think is the cost yes membership in the clubs is expensive the equipment is very expensive requires special shoes requires special you know special equipment there's so many right and then they want to play another course that's not they're not a member of and other fees it really is high that's right that's right that's right it it can get very expensive and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing yeah oh yeah yeah and they don't give those sessions away and nor do they give uh instructions away right as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in g olf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near Brookhaven uh-huh uh-huh we'll just take you over to the course and get you some lessons and let you see if you like it if you do then we can go golf together uh-huh i said oh whoa great i get to walk all around a little green field all day but those kinds of things happen though you you get a little taste of it and you say hey this is not bad uh-huh and you really begin to develop an interest in it but i am not an athlete at all uh you know i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball and me either and uh hung hung hung my fingernails in the net in volleyball so i am not an athlete maybe golf is a forgiving sport i don't know yeah at least you're just competing you're competing against yourself i guess more than everybody else out there yeah it doesn't appear to be um-hum i really i i haven't really acquired an interest in it but i'm open to try anything you know yeah that's kind of the way i feel the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned my skin is very fair so i'm going to have to golf in the evening or i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me and i don't think oh right  okay so okay we're going to talk about lawn and garden today okay um where do you work at or do you you wish to discuss that right what uh no i i'm in uh well i live in uh Richardson Texas and uh oh okay yeah we're neighbors okay yeah and uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden work uh and uh hi can you hang on just a minute thank you yeah i have no idea he didn't broadcast thank you uh-huh i'm sorry go ahead no so uh uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh when i get a chance i listen to Neil Sperry and do that and uh oh i do all the time i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him yeah uh i have his book too um-hum yeah don't do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh not in Texas tried tried tried some tried some different flowers and and uh bushes and stuff and uh uh have a have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you um-hum well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey i'm going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huh-uh i can do it much yeah yeah cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was yeah yeah well and it i thought well i'm going to do this all the time well good so i found you know and i've got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do yeah no which is at it's just unreal he said i needed to pull every leave off the tree and the tree is fifteen feet high and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase and i thought uh-oh this is this is unreal this is unreal yeah so uh i think i'll get my son-in-law to do it for me if he will but yeah what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest yes it's a disease that it's got and i don't know what happened to it uh and then it what well what kind it um well what kind of trees are they well one is a maple one is um huh a maple but i would much prefer i think it's not a native Texan tree yeah and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property and they don't get any care and they're Cedar Elm and they're just beautiful uh-huh uh-huh so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper some people have really a green thumb and you know and um although i don't have yeah too serious a problem but i don't know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know Sperry said you know that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles yeah the last two years that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from the prior two years yeah so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have yeah and i really hate to lose them but um that's one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i yeah yeah well that's that's one thing that we had we've had very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the uh what what trees were were there when we moved in uh uh um-hum were had been put in by the developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think yeah and uh right the quick growing yeah and they and he figured up last night at there were seven different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them we've lost to the wind weren't too good trees we've lost to wind uh uh um um-hum three we three we've lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty three and uh and then uh a year ago we lost uh can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees did are they still there did you cut them down at the at the ground level or did you pull them up by the roots or how did you get rid of them because if i another one well i i don't know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches and yeah well we didn't have we didn't have any that were that oh that big when they uh went two of two of them uh the wind the wind blew over uh um-hum oh in in terms of getting them down uh um-hum because i don't want stubs in my lawn because you still have to but yeah yeah now the the one that the one that we lost the last one that we lost a a year ago uh up up until then they don't hadn't been big enough but what i just um-hum used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as i could and then the base to the ground um-hum uh got some got some chemical that you drill holes and pour in that helps bore i see try uh a stump killer yeah uh-huh helps rot the stump killer yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter but uh this last one had a fair sized root and some guy uh-huh was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didn't want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty five bucks and i said fine and he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it yeah and they get that saw and i think it's a kind some kind of a screwing a screwing thing that just rips it right out yeah yeah and it it just it just ripped it right right out yeah right out and uh i took the it it left the it left he left the chips and i used those for uh mulch sure put them up mulch around around around the other shrubs and uh sure uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that i filled in with and and it's filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh um-hum a blessing in disguise i mean you two fold purpose yeah yeah yeah but uh yeah well you do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing lawn yes um-hum yes i have a i have a self-propelled uh Snapper yeah because i'm sitting on a hill and it uh and it's very difficult to address oh yeah yeah i uh yeah i i i uh we just got a a old push uh uh Sears mower i it's been fifteen years now since we we first moved to Texas we've had it and i keep waiting for it to die but every year it just seems to hang on and uh and uh i do it my do it myself but uh yeah well a year a year ago i took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said well that's good they're very expensive uh no it's it's too old we won't even work on it and and i took it back home and it's can't kept plugs along but uh but my son's uh one one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have oh booey yeah yeah they always try to give you a song and dance  okay can you uh give me your thoughts on what women's roles are or how they've changed well um i'm in my i i i've seen the changes i think in my generation most of all because i'm a early baby boomer and uh i was brought up uh to sort of get married and raise children and uh be very domestic and uh when i went to college or went to high school i did very well i was urged to become a secretary or a teacher because those are typical roles and uh things have changed and i i've ventured off in all sorts of areas and so have most of the other women in my generation and we're all in business or the professions and uh and uh heavens we're we're uh astronauts and things like that who know who would wouldn't have been imagined in nineteen sixty eight or something how about you yeah well i was kind of same thing it's you know i was i was brought up in a small town and and women tended to just get married and take care of the house um but as as times changed um the price of things i guess started rising and it took more than one income yes so more um more and more of young women were staying in school they were getting a better education and they were going out into the work force yes another thing that happened that i found is that you know when i got married i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced or or when i was younger i didn't know anybody who had ever been divorced yeah in this day and age people are as likely to get divorced as to stay married and very often the woman has to be able to earn a decent living and uh so there's an additional reason for her to be capable of holding down a good job yeah i think perhaps uh um years ago it was a stigma on a family to have a divorce in it yes and whether it was warranted or not people just stayed together because of what the family thought uh people little bit smarter today than that they uh uh yes there's a family unit and it's and it's very difficult if there uh are children especially young children but in a lot of cases it's probably it would probably more difficult if they stayed together but uh i think women are taking a uh a more active role in politics i i think that uh within the next ten or fifteen years you'll probably see a woman vice president or a woman president and you'll also see a lot more uh congressmen and senators uh women i i agree with that and i also think that they're taking a lead in in the arts and in business too and uh as as the years go by they run surveys to see how many women are CEOs or on the boards of major companies and the number is creeping up very slowly but it's definitely increasing so that probably ten years from now is that right you think they you think that's the case yes it is i mean ten fifteen ten fifteen years ago there were no women on the boards or or or CEO's of major corporations unless they inherited the firm from their father you know that sort of thing oh yeah if it was if it was a family owned business you mean but right if it was a family owned business but now they're they're in the board room and they're trying to get ahead and make it in the business world of course to some extent the laws are helping them but uh uh you know there's no no no holding back their ambition on the other hand what it does to the fabric of society and the family remains to be seen yeah i still i still think it's it's uh it's a two tiered system i uh i know of of uh women engineers and and uh supervisors that are uh they have to work twice as hard it seems like to achieve the same levels that a male does uh i don't know if that's just my imagination or not but it seems to be that's uh the ones that are up there seem to have a little bit more intelligence than their counterparts i i i if there was if it was up to me i think i would have uh more females because it seems like they try harder well i think that in a way they're they're being tested right now we're going through a testing period where capability is is everything and if they succeed then the the the generation of girls that are growing up now will have it much easier because there will be a precedent they'll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies right they'll have role models they'll have protectors sorry they'll have protectors yes uh there'll be more and more women that are up higher and higher yes um and also they say that the bulk of the wealth is controlled by women now uh just through i guess uh uh the men dying off and just leaving their uh fortunes to women so that's going to have a big impact uh if you've got money and brains you can you can wield a lot of power um i guess just by virtue of living longer in a way you're right because they do it does does come to them but they've got to be young enough to enjoy it i mean if they're just old ladies sitting around waiting for the end to come it doesn't do them much good yeah yeah it must be the culture's different uh down there than up here also um they're kind of uh the old Yankees yes you know it it takes uh uh it takes a stick of dynamite to get them moving off center in a lot of cases where uh the Midwest i think is a little bit more aggressive because they're closer to the west coast where they're uh highly aggressive you know uh ideas and or it seems like new ideas start out there and then kind of work their way east i don't know if you've found that to be true well i'm in the middle of the country and and it seems to me they could they start their from start from both coasts and work their ways inward uh one of the one of the things that that i'm finding is that i've lived in Texas i've lived in New York and uh i have i've done a lot of visiting out in California and i know that we're lagging behind here and yet i really do see uh women's roles have increased and they're gaining new respect in fact i believe that the mayor of the top five major Texas cities are all women um and that goes back to your original point about politics yeah so uh uh you know it's going to get to a point i some men are going to wonder if they're falling behind uh-huh the uh i think the only problem there is the men that themselves that feel threatened by by a woman yes uh by her intelligence probably uh those are the ones that you're going to have problems with i think uh a lot of the at least my kids they seem to have a a more open mind today than uh like when i was growing up i think the young people today do have an open mind it's just not as much uh typecasting by sex by gender uh you know uh a little girl can say i want to be an astronaut or i want to be a fireman or a policeman or right or a Rhodes scholar which was impossible when i was going to college uh Rhodes  well crime's not very bad out there no as a matter of fact i understand we have one of the lowest crime rates in the area but then we aren't we're only a city of five thousand uh-huh right how's Richardson doing it's been a lot worse this year um they have a lot of drug dealers over on you know where Spring Valley is and Coit yes uh-huh it's real bad there has been for a few years especially on the Dallas side um Dallas is just across the street and and uh they've closed down a bunch of apartment complexes and uh you know like that and they're having to crime sweep uh-huh well i wonder why it effects certain areas because i i i've lived in the Dallas area perhaps for about uh thirteen years now and i used to live in that not in that particular area but on that side of of Dallas uh-huh and that was always a a fairly good area in there if i remember correctly yeah it used to be but um i guess it moves in different uh areas at different times um the only problem that we have here are are you know just very minute sort of crime we have neighborhood crime watch programs and then the uh city police patrol the areas at least one a day and when you're not at home you're to notify your neighbors of course that you know you're going out of time et cetera et cetera and not do the things that are so obvious to uh potential right get someone to pick up your papers and your mail uh-huh set your lights on timers and right yeah but um other than that that's about the only thing we're doing in Sachse uh-huh the murder rate really seems to be up in Fort Worth and Dallas well especially Dallas last year in Fort Worth this year i think i saw on TV just this evening that there was a pregnant woman and and some members of her family killed was that over in Fort Worth uh-huh yeah this morning uh-huh hm and apparently they already they already caught him or they're talking about somebody else they're talking about two million dollar bond for somebody is that right yeah i never i never heard all of the story about that i just heard it from people at work and on the radio uh a little bit uh-huh uh-huh oh it's really been Fort Worth has really been bad because of the kidnappings and all the armed robberies i wonder why over there i mean i'm glad it's not over here if you have to have it but um i don't understand why certain i i think i think that um they're just getting well they had that crazy person that kidnapped the the woman and took her all they way to Saint Louis before they were caught you know uh-huh and she called the FBI was it over in that area last year that they had the man um that was in the mall and this other man shot his wife in in the mall area she and she was screaming and heading towards the entrance to the mall and they shot her and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the the guy was that over in oh i i think that was Redbird oh oh that was Redbird yeah it's real bad too hm everywhere there's a mall there's bad crime though as a matter of fact this summer early early actually earlier this spring i had gone to Collin Creek mall and my hubcaps were stolen yeah and the police officer told me that um the the malls are a very good area where these people like to go and steal the hubcaps they just steal one side yeah yeah exactly uh-huh and and take off they stole the emblem off of one of mine did they yeah well i don't know whether that's a faddish thing or what apparently and then it costs us so much to uh replace those things uh-huh yeah surely from the insurance and yeah they also they tear off the hood ornaments too and one of them costs thirty dollars so uh-huh uh-huh and your deductible of course doesn't mean that it's it's under that it's it's normally right that's right yeah i don't know uh-huh um i really don't know what else to say does that about cover it yeah i think so okay i mean and they said take what steps and we already discussed that you know you know uh-huh about the only thing you do is is to provide the um protection in your own home and then be careful when you do go out at night if you go out at night and um certainly that's about the best thing we can do and uh right they have any laws against that sort of thing yeah i work at Valley View and they have horse patrols and um and they have the mall security that that drives around probably around the mall at least once every ten minutes at night especially because they have so many stolen cars and they've had um uh-huh oh really three three armed robberies of uh jewelry stores um and uh and they've all been in the middle of the day you know um and uh one of them was three hundred thousand dollars that's quite a lot of money isn't it yeah really is and it gives other i imagine other uh potential crime people uh ideas too but i've seen they've stepped up security quite a bit uh-huh and the police are around a lot more now so i imagine they're going to need more police officers too yeah if they do that then they use they use undercover too yeah i guess that's true uh-huh well even here in Sachse we have one undercover police car right uh-huh and actually if we had to call him a few times and they're usually on the spot in about five minutes oh yeah course as i say we're a small town yeah small town but still you know yeah at least they're there right so well i've enjoyed talking to you yeah it's nice talking to you okay have a good evening bye-bye you too bye-bye  do you use your credit cards very often um no not really we use gas cards more than anything okay is that just out of habit or convenience uh basically convenience uh-huh uh which led to habit i guess okay i don't use gasoline credit cards i used to have one but i didn't use it uh i used it so seldom that i'd get letters from Mobil uh reminding me that i had a credit card to use oh really yeah we don't we don't ever we don't carry a whole lot of cash with us so we use the the gas cards because our families are both out of town and like when we travel and stuff we use the gas cards right so you basically use them as an alternative to carrying cash yeah yeah and then we have a an American Express that's through TI that Steve uses just for TI stuff are you uh solicited a lot uh for other uh credit cards yes yes a lot what what uh criteria do you consider on whether or not you'll accept a particular card uh probably the uh uh if there's a premium each year and the uh the APR yeah i won't get a card if there's an annual fee and there's it's it's kind of hard to beat TI right and so uh you know usually we just trash it just tear it up and trash it and most most of the time it goes unopened yeah i i i think that Texan's is charging thirteen point nine percent uh interest yeah if if that much they're thirteen something but i'm not sure if it's i think it's a flat thirteen right now it could be could be i don't uh use them often enough to even keep tabs on it yeah but most of them charge between eighteen and twenty one percent per year yeah i think that's and then you're then you're if you're that lucky you get to pay them another twenty five bucks a year just to be that privileged to get twenty one percent a year right right and i look for a grace period too so that they don't charge interest on from from the day of purchase yeah yeah and of course no annual fee yeah that would that would help a lot i i'm not even sure why i mean the purpose of an annual fee i'm not really well i i think it just generates revenue for the companies that uh for the banks that sponsor the credit cards well i guess so because it's not any more prestigious to have to pay it uh as far as getting another card where you don't i mean you know no uh i get uh applications for cards from oh different places for various reasons uh i got an application from Home Depot for their card oh really and uh the incentive there was that they'd give you ten percent off on your first purchase with that credit card yeah so i got that card just so i could uh make a major purchase have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card right and get a discount on it right yeah that i did did the same thing with uh Foley's they uh uh had a fifteen percent discount on a purchase if you just apply for a card yeah right i did that with my husband uh he was off working at TI in Austin one day and so i went out to the mall to kind of look around and hit Mervyn's and found some stuff stuff after Christmas on sale and ended up getting fifteen percent off already off of it already whatever it was lower and i think that's the only card i have that's yeah uh-huh you know recently is gotten a Mervyn's card and i used it for i think for the first time when i was in Houston this weekend and i have i've had it for months yeah yeah i always maintain a zero balance uh i don't like owing anybody anything yeah yeah i don't i don't like it a whole lot either if you want to borrow money there're better ways to do it uh i think you can get a loan through the credit union for about uh oh i don't know nine or ten percent now i guess yeah yeah and uh keeping a credit cards uh charged up is just uh not a very good way to uh to make to make use of borrowing money yeah i never understood how people could i mean there are some people who say well i can't charge it it's at it's limit and i thought God how can you charge a credit card to its limit it just it just i guess it's that that you know lack of discipline when you have a piece of plastic that says pay later you know yeah it's the buy now pay later plan and uh live for today yeah and i just it's that yeah it just borrow worry about it tomorrow nobody bothers saving any money yeah and it just i don't i don't really go for them and i in fact i had my own before we got married and ended up cutting them up just for the fact that TI had lower rates yeah sure you know and decided and i mean when i tried to close with Chase Manhattan it was just like pulling teeth oh yeah i mean i couldn't close they'd send me a statement every little this is your new you know balance with bonus points or whatever you know and it's like look i closed this months ago and i don't want any more of your letters i don't want anything and well you have a credit balance well send me a check you know right yeah well there's a a basic problem too with not using credit cards that they are good credit references when i closed on my house mortgage uh the mortgage company was looking for uh references credit references and i didn't have any credit cards charged up at all i keep the balance paid off so they make lousy credit reference then yeah yeah yeah yeah they do but we we were in in that same boat a couple of years ago and they had said well just list your major ones and and the balance still owed on it you know or give it a balance still owed on it and right that's all we did when the balance is zero it doesn't help much right i get a lot of uh pre approved applications from various organizations and i throw all those out yeah and it's like well who are you to approve something for me without my permission anyway right but i think um i think what you can do as far as i don't think as many companies when you are a good customer i don't think they report that as much as they should their delinquent customers right uh-huh because a lot of times you have to write a nd ask them to report it to the credit bureau so that you look like you have good credit as far as you know paying off you know your cards early or on time or whatever yeah uh-huh that usually doesn't happen unless i've heard people say well you have to write to ask that and i say well you know if someone's so quick to turn you over because you're thirty days late um-hum i think they should they should do do that more often yeah i think you're right uh what do you think about that uh Discover card i well uh funny thing about the Discover card is i just pulled a uh one dollar check from them out of my briefcase today that expired uh last month i didn't cash it uh they they sent me a dollar uh refund from last year's purchase i i used it one time oh really and uh i got a dollar credit a dollar check but i didn't uh cash the check and the check expired but on my last statement i noticed that they credited my account with a dollar credit the dollar you didn't cash could very well be oh oh well i was wondering how that that worked because it's like you know we'll pay you for and i'm going wait a minute you know i've got so many uh well i don't have a lot of cards but i've got a lot that i never used uh i stick basically with uh the Texan's MasterCard and uh very seldom use the American Express card yeah we don't we wouldn't even have one if it wasn't for TI and Steve traveling we just sure corporate card you know i would never pay thirty five dollars or more a year for uh use of a card no and uh we basically just have the we you know we cut up a lot of cards when we you know like it's just as easy just to use two you know instead of paying so much  i guess we're ready okay so what's wrong with our school systems besides it's really screwed up some of them well i i don't think i don't think all of them i think maybe mainly Dallas school systems because Richardson is fine and my son was in Garland and Plano he was in all three them Richardson Plano and Garland and i don't have any problems with with with them as far as you know well um well it's been a long time since i been in uh involved with public school systems uh i think my youngest girl has graduated and she graduated in eighty nine so oh my goodness i think the biggest problem for now days with the school system is some of the parents i don't wanna say all of them because i'm not one of them but some of the parents thinks just uh they're baby sitters and they're not um-hum you know they're putting a lot of responsibilities off on the teachers and i don't think they should i think they should also get involved well i don't know if uh you mean they keep the children they want the teachers to keep the children longer under a shelf it's in there under there hello okay uh what do you mean by that statement do you mean they want the children uh the teachers to keep the children longer than they're supposed to or are they to train them no more or less train train them yeah in all phases of life uh sometimes more discipline discipline uh because really you mean just in they wouldn't be too much of a discipline problems i think if parents would um well the discipline starts in the home well that's that's what i'm saying and carries over into the school when they are school age and and that's right but i mean you have kids you have kids going to school with guns knives that's that's from the home but you know it's i don't know i guess parents aren't and i think the school i think oh that's well like when i was growing up you know you didn't have all this problems i mean we had problems in school but not like this nothing like the guns and the and the and the violence there is in the school with kids well it's just gotten uh completely out of hand as far as the violence in the schools and i don't know what the solution to that is at all i mean its just uh yeah hum-um to me it's utter chaos i don't know how some of those teachers function because uh they are being violated by the students and i know that there are some schools that are patrolled by um private police and even public police and and and they're not getting any satisfaction from that effort yeah um-hum and they're not getting any paid neither i mean there's not you know it's like a hazardous job now to in some schools i should say not all schools some schools you know it's i think uh i don't know what the solution is if the government doesn't know how are the um there's somebody that needs to rise up and have a plan that is going to resolve the many issues that are facing the public school system and i wouldn't know where to start since i haven't been involved in the public school system that much well i've been involved and you know what i still don't know the problem i mean i wouldn't know where to begin to solve it i mean when my children were in school they were in a in a private school system so i mean we just i mean they just knew that they had to toe the line otherwise they would uh suffer the consequences and and that was enough for them i mean they just were very responsible kids and i didn't have any problems with them yeah and i believe that uh that starts in the home and then if the children are influenced i guess they're influenced by their peers yeah and uh monkey see monkey do a lot of times and then but see that also begins at home because he and it kind of my son has well i i've seen a lot of kids you know and it's like i tell my son that's not my child what that child does don't you do i say well see i'm not his mother and i you know you will get in trouble for something somebody else parent may or may not let they child do but you know right from wrong so well i guess that's the bottom line if the children do know right from wrong yeah and uh with uh with so many of the parents being disorganized themselves it's no wonder that the children are so you have to look at that uh factor also where those children are coming from and what kind of home life they have yeah but what and then you got what about this other  Wayne i've uh feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available how do you feel about it well yeah i feel much the same way i've uh two kids right now one is two and a half and one's nine months and uh yeah that age of course everything you do they're trying to learn to do and so uh it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn you know that that they need to learn at the age you know yeah reading and uh reading and playing nice with others and that sort of thing yeah we went through this with our children and now with our grandchildren and i've always tried to do things with them uh like when you're at the little league helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself i was able to help the coach in in just controlling the kids if nothing else and we've always uh oh tried to take our children and now now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to i think that's just part of their overall educational process is to get out and see and do things right uh-huh yeah yeah so it's uh we have uh lived several places around the the US and we have where we've lived we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area like when we lived in Tennessee we we took them to Washington DC to see all the capitol and and things like that when they were small and that just uh it helps i think the children to when they're learning in school to say well i've been there and i've seen that right uh-huh yeah yeah so uh that's the type yeah it certainly does because uh you know the things in the books seem so dead to the kids and you know unless they've actually been there or whatever because i remember our family well we went we went everywhere and uh uh seeing New England and uh being on Plymouth Rock and stuff like that was uh yeah really made the whole thing more uh visual and you could uh read the things in the history books and understand what they said when it was like we need food we need to raise food quickly because this this place gets very cold very soon yes yeah yeah yeah we've uh gone through that uh i remember my parents didn't do all those type things and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that and even now with my grandchildren i feel it's a very important thing to be done right because if uh kids don't look up to you or or can't can't feel they can spend time with you they're going to find someone else and uh yeah you know nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to emulating or whatever yeah well i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is uh when my son was i think it was in the sixth grade they had to write uh a little brief autobiography of themselves and about what they had done and what they wanted to do and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to uh have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him a real a real point of pride with me yeah that is nice yeah excuse me we sound like we both have colds yeah well it's um well it's uh uh ten o'clock here in Falls Church Virginia so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold and the wife says well you need something to do talk to the guy on the phone oh oh oh well you're kind yeah well i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of Dallas Texas so we're we're kind of far apart here yeah we've uh this is a very interesting program i i've heard about here on this and when i signed up for it it uh looked like it could be uh make a real contribution in in participating and uh right yeah i'm uh electrical engineer by trade yeah uh here in Virginia likewise we uh we do some projects every now and then we like to get support from uh other other companies as well so yeah yeah i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan so you know trying to work myself out of a job but it's it's been an interesting uh roughly oh nine months here and uh oh again this is our home area we've lived here about seventeen years and it's uh we enjoy living here it's where we originally started out and we've lived up north for a while in Chicago and over in Tennessee so wound up back about two hundred miles aware away from where we started out yep well uh that's about all i can think to talk about right now it's been a pleasure talking with you okay right bye-bye thank you bye  um i guess my music taste musical tastes uh run pretty much the gambit i listen to a little bit of everything oh well that's good uh yeah uh i i grew up in east Texas listening to mostly mostly mostly country type music country and western type stuff uh-huh yeah uh and of course uh grew up also with rock and roll so i'm that's pretty much ingrained yeah uh right now most of my musical uh experiences experiences are with radio um-hum we listen to one of the local uh you what's usually the number one local rock type station uh adult contemporary soft rock Ron Chapman right hum yeah oh yeah yeah is that KVIL or yeah and uh so we we listen to that uh pretty much all the time huh well i grew up around here i grew up in Fort Worth um-hum hum and uh it's funny because KVIL back when i was a teenager was an AM station i think yeah and uh it used to have like the top twenty top forty all the time you know right right and i of course i was listening to rock music what what i called rock music when i was a teenager now the music is so different than what i used to listen to that i don't know if i could could consider it the same but yeah well it's i i was just thinking uh you know we we say or KVIL says i think i think they call theirs uh adult contemporary yeah yeah uh which means soft rock or early early type rock music and and that's really what i what i consider rock and roll right right yeah yeah well it's uh not rock my husband and i are both that way we we both really like the Beatles a lot and um right um-hum well it's that's funny because i even when i first heard the Beatles i couldn't stand them you know it took it took a a while before i really liked the Beatles oh really that's funny well i'm probably older than you then but but i uh i always thought the Beatles were great and well i doubt that yeah i i might have been too old for the Beatles that might have been what it was i was past that point when they came along uh but uh i i grew up uh listening to Elvis you know before even before the Beatles so oh oh that's funny oh yeah yeah see i liked Elvis a lot and he was like my hero and now my little girl thinks it's real funny because uh she'll see him she'll go ooh you mean you really thought he was neat right yeah but uh but uh yeah but uh my uh like i said my my tastes run run the range we listen to uh you know even listen to a little bit of classical type stuff my my wife uh plays the piano um and she plays a little bit of that and so we you know we listen to that she plays you know whatever what she can what she wants to yeah yeah well that's good um yeah but uh i guess musicians or singers in particular uh uh Willie Nelson's one of my favorites you know so uh it uh yeah i like Willie Nelson too in the in the country and western rein uh vein i really i'm enjoying quite a bit of the country music now yeah well see i the the reason i said my taste is probably different is i have always liked country music and my husband has always been just total rock yeah um-hum yeah and so uh we never could agree on what we were going to listen to after we got married because i'd want to listen hear country and he'd want to hear rock and we couldn't get along because his rock was too rock for me i like soft rock but i don't like some of the heavy metal stuff he was listening to yeah and um so both of us were real strong members of a church and uh we decided we start listening to contemporary Christian music so we started listening to one of the stations around here that we both really like it plays just Christian music all the time uh-huh yeah and we've gotten now where that's pretty much all we listen to and uh there're some really really talented artists that's you know song writers and singers that uh do just Christian music um-hum yes i uh right so of course you know Amy Grant and people like that are pretty well known there's a guy named Bruce Carroll and he's my favorite because he has a country sound but it's Christian lyrics um-hum yeah um-hum and he's a wonderful song writer he won a an an is it Emmy or what does it Grammy it's the Grammy awards they give for music yeah he won a Grammy for inspirational song of the year last year so right let's see the the Grammy yeah uh-huh well our our daughter uh listens to uh to quite a bit to one of those uh i don't know which station it is she listens to yeah our son our son is into heavy metal and our daughter's into the the the Christian type music uh-huh yeah well that's neat uh matter of face she went to a went to the concert down at uh Reunion last week uh oh Sandy Patty and yeah well that's pretty neat well see i'm excited that kids these days are liking decent music and uh Sandy Patty right yeah um-hum i mean all the songs of of course on on this station have real good good lyrics and good ideas and that kind of thing so i really encourage my daughter to listen to that and she right now she loves it i don't know right yeah yeah yeah if it'll stick with her she's still young in elementary school so oh yeah well that's our daughter's an adult so but uh so she's yeah well that's that's good that she still chooses that but you know i like the country sound there are several i like i like Willie Nelson i always like Don Williams my dad thought i was crazy but yeah yeah oh yeah i love i love his uh he's always been one of my favorites and um then my husband on the other hand he i guess when he was like in his early twenties really got into the heavy metal kind of stuff before we got married and yeah um-hum yeah so then he'd want to play that stuff and i was like oh that's giving me a headache uh that's uh our son goes you know goes off into his room and and turns his on he he's not around much either either very very much but yeah yeah yeah he'd go into his room and turn it up you know and we'd do our best to to live with it or get him to turn it down so and uh that's right but uh you know it's i'm not uh i don't uh don't find too much of the heavy metal stuff that i want to listen to yeah yeah yeah well i still whenever they um have these advertisements on TV for um records that have like all the songs from the seventies i was i was in high school like from the early seventies and uh um-hum so all that music brings back a lot of memories you know and i'm always thinking oh i'd like to have one of those albums but since we made this agreement that we're going to listen to Christian music i think oh well i'll probably set it on the shelf and would never you know play it let's see yeah that's yeah so instead so instead y ou buy Sandy Patty and Amy Grant and yeah that's right we buy things that we know the whole family can listen to right that yeah that uh i was trying to think there's some uh we go to the First Baptist Church over here in Richardson uh-huh and uh there some some of the musicians some of the young people from there that have become oh that's neat semi pro i guess musicians our daughter's gone uh gone on a couple of choir tour things with the with the young peoples' choir uh-huh oh that's good yeah and uh you know she she really gets into into that singing with that group you know and yeah well see i'm an interesting person because i go to the Church of Christ and there's a lot of people at Church of Christ that think uh uh-huh now that's you don't have music in the Church of Christ that's right and and i think my personal opinion is they're missing out on a lot and i love um this you know that KLTY that's what i listen to all the time and i oh yeah i love all the music that they play on there but i have a lot of people that go to church with me that kind of criticize that and think that uh it's wrong and all this so uh it yeah well i guess uh you know there there there are are ways to express your feelings and your beliefs and uh music is one of the ways of expression and you know it's not uh yeah yeah yeah well i told my husband the one thing i like about it is uh you know you kind of think about whatever you listen to i mean you just you may not realize you're doing it but you do and uh when i listen to Christian music then i'm listening i'm thinking about something good you know and um-hum right i'll be washing dishes or something and i'll think about a song and it'll bring back you know some ideas and so to me it's just a good influence but there's still a whole lot of other music i you know really enjoy listening to my husband and i both kind of really got into REO Speedwagon yeah right  so PC's personal computers do you have a personal computer no i don't not at home i work with them quite a bit though um-hum hm i i work with them at Kelly Services doing uh data entry oh okay um-hum what do you what do you think about them the well i think they're useful i think they're in some in some instances they're they're over used well that's not the right way to say it um you mean instead of people or well i think that uh some some work places where i've been they they set up like everybody has their own PC um-hum which a lot of times everybody doesn't need a PC and it really without them knowing how to use it properly it slows them down more than it helps them accomplish something right they spend more time messing with the PC than they would actually accomplishing the task that they're trying to do if they didn't have a PC at all um-hum and you really have to be able to type pretty fast before you know before it it really saves time uh-huh that's true um-hum and you have to you know be familiar with the like there're so many different software packages it you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most um-hum a lot of times uh people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly and so they waste more time with their trying to uh to figure out how to do you know other things than they would if they if they actually understood what they were trying to do you know like uh they want to to format a report a certain way um-hum and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could they could do that in uh about you know half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly to set up the boundaries correctly and right exactly how many lines you're going to use in it and uh-huh a lot of times they they they do it manually on the computer which just really is a waste of time and then if they ever have to change anything in that in that in the document they have to go back and redo it all manually whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly the package would do that for them um-hum whenever they wanted to make a change so i i've seen that as a problem can't can't you put can't you put it on a disk and then just edit it if if you need to when you go back right but in some in some cases the with the formatting what i'm talking about is that they would set up they set up a certain um document and it may be eight pages long right and they set it up manually so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually um-hum and and and um and um then when they have to make a change say they want to insert a paragraph they've got to go through the document and reset all the page breaks manually rewrite the whole thing and rewrite the whole thing instead of having the if if they had set up the formatting on the system itself it would do that for them and save them a lot of time but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with very different length lines oh no no you can left and right justify the whole thing it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block hm it'll it'll automatically it's like typesetting it'll automatically do that for you and it divides the words by itself usually it doesn't divide words they usually have it it have it space the words in a line rather than divide a word oh okay um-hum that you see like in a newspaper right they typeset they don't usually break words in a newspaper if the if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line they just they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines right um-hum they space it out in in the line itself oh right and most computers do that most packages most software packages will do that for you they um um-hum and i've known people that have used a package for for five years you know and i would say well have you you know you know more about this package than i do how do you left justify and they would say i don't know um-hum and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was to caused this to happen and they would say how did you do that and i'm like well it's really easy and they were like well i never knew that and that obviously they'd never considered looking it up you know um-hum do you think it's a lack of training um or it's just that they don't use the materials that are available to them sometimes it's sometimes well it's it's a number of different things sometimes they don't uh they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual some manuals aren't really designed very well um-hum but some of them are and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that it that just a a basic general user can understand them so i think um people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time because they think well it's quicker just to do it myself when it's really not right um-hum it's better to learn it directly from the manual well i think so especially when you have to trouble shoot some things um-hum exactly because a lot of the times the computer the program still has uh bugs in it and you have to work around it uh-huh hm have you worked mostly on IBM um uh the the with PC's they're either IBM or IBM compatible mostly um-hum yeah that's uh that is you know the industry standard that's all i've seen in offices is IBM um-hum uh-huh there's a lot of of really good IBM compatibles too they don't have to necessarily be the IBM brand but they have to adhere to that industry standard right well do you think it's been five minutes yet or oh probably oh okay well well it was nice talking to you thank you bye-bye okay bye-bye  well i know that uh i have only like two or three favorite television shows uh-huh i think one of my favorite then is from the guy Stephen is it Brochco who does like LA Law uh-huh and uh he also did Hillstreet Blues i like those type of shows oh yeah uh-huh yes yeah we we really enjoy that too uh-huh uh i don't get a lot to watch a whole lot of TV we have a couple of young children and so uh-huh we're usually outside and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows shows that if we get them in bed we usually watch that and L A Law is one of my favorites uh-huh oh yeah me too i know they uh i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the reruns in the middle of the season yeah and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns they start showing some of their newer stuff yeah so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that oh and so you must watch a lot of uh Disney or cartoons then well we have on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers that kind of stuff and i think those programs are really good for children i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there um-hum it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing you know not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff and they usually right uh show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world so um-hum um-hum my son older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so oh that's true that's true well i noticed that my kids are uh older now they're uh getting close to the teenage years but they did we watched all of Mister Rogers and everything but even some of your uh cartoons can be very violent um-hum yeah and uh you know they they talk about death and we were watching uh oh gosh that Bugs Bunny just last night oh yeah and um uh i think it was on uh i have to remember which channel but anyway uh we were watching that and it was talking about opera and they showed like what they thought an opera would be and one of the things was to kill the rabbit kill the rabbit oh and i thought oh how violent you know to kill the rabbit so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end uh but then of course the the rabbit comes back to life and says well see this is how an opera is supposed to be and i thought gee whiz if a little kid was watching this you know that would be pretty violent even uh for a small child well yeah and you know they especially boys i mean they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever you know um-hum right and showing them something like that really doesn't teach them that it is that's right that's right well i don't think cartoons portray that but like no and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend i think is the hardest part you know yeah yeah a cat has nine lives yeah but they don't they just have one like we do oh so that's really funny but uh we've gotten uh-huh go ahead i i was just going to say i know that at least before our kids were born we used to always enjoy watching the Cosby Show Thursday nights usually had pretty good with that and as far as um very good comedy um-hum um-hum i like to watch Designing Women if the kids are in bed by then yes yes yeah that's true that's a good show i used to watch uh Dallas i don't i don't know where you're at we're we're in Dallas uh-huh Dallas yeah yeah i used to watch Dallas years years ago and somewhere in the middle i got uh bored and uh so i in fact i didn't even watch the finale uh you know that's about how disinterested i had become yes well i did watch it just to see what it was and wasn't it wasn't really that great so i think after a while they just kind of you know there's no new stuff they can do they've done everything dirty in the book you know so uh-huh well actually uh-huh yep yep i know i know was was it actually based on a book well no i imagine oh but you were just talking about okay everything you could think of you know had a hard time and i think maybe with Dallas as far as they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first okay yeah right that's true that's true where i don't know i never watched Knots Landing but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around stay um-hum um-hum yeah in if you notice and if you notice on Dallas they lost all the women yeah yes so the men mainly stayed but the women were the ones who left and i thought that was very interesting and wondered kind of wondered about that uh well anyway that's a whole new issue oh goodness so anyway i don't know if our five minutes are over yet yeah oh but we uh we also have the paid uh television channels uh the only thing i don't like about it especially with teenagers is that all the violence the sex the nudity and the curse words uh-huh you know and so i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me so uh they had to have picked them up from uh the T V yeah one nice thing though about the cable company we use they have uh they have that little parental uh uh key yeah yeah um-hum so i i have that at home and i keep the keys with me where you can lock up the channel or whatever yeah and that's about the only way that i can that i can do it because their natural curiosity you know to go towards that way and want yeah yeah and i don't know the way the generations are up growing up now i mean i just think they watch so much more T V i try to limit what they watch they aren't sitting in the house watching T V all day um-hum um-hum because i think it's good for them to have physical activity and that kind of stuff too so yeah and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings it's the only cool time to be outside that's true well and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high well true well it was nice talking to you well it was nice talking to you too okay talk with you later good-bye okay bye-bye  are you in the market for a car recently yeah i just bought a car oh what'd you get i got a nineteen eighty three Cavalier station wagon uh-huh what what convinced you to get that one well a a friend of my father's and he'd driven it all over the country and it runs great um-hum oh incredible how many miles on it it's like it has a hundred and fifty three thousand and it's still running real well yeah oh great yeah we have um right now we have two cars um i have my husband and myself we have two sons who are drivers um-hum and one of which is a um an eighty eight Plymouth Voyager Van and then we have um about a year ago we picked up a second hand uh uh Audi um-hum uh and uh that was a car you know a car a sedan and uh we got that i don't i'll the major things the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova and a well my son was driving and someone came into his lane and hit him and fortunately he was able to his i mean he was checked out of the hospital was out of the hospital by that night but the car was completely totaled um-hum and Mike and they had been my sons two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that which was hit by another car um so i mean i got i was getting really nervous so i finally said we i want a really solid car so we found the Audi second hand i guess right now my criteria for cars is uh uh solid being solid able to take an impact right and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car um-hum but the the things that i would want would be a solid car another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes right uh our our van which is a a delight to drive does not have i i think the brakes on the Plymouth van is just are terrible hm um if the road is at all wet and i'm and i don't go all that fast but the uh it it just doesn't hold it doesn't hold well at all so uh i i definitely would want to get antilock brakes so i don't know uh do you have any particular things that that are priorities on your list well it's i didn't really need power windows but it has power you know windows and steering and air conditioning and and uh yeah i guess down there air conditioning's a must isn't it um-hum oh yeah it it has a stereo and a cassette player and um it he's told me it gets forty two miles to gallon uh-huh that's incredible that is incredible um-hum so uh we we get about our the uh van gets on highways can get about twenty eight the Audi does not have good mileage that's the one drawback it's a powerful car um-hum um but it does not uh i mean i if i'm on a highway and i can get twenty twenty one miles in per gallon i consider that lucky i'm lucky maybe maybe sometimes i've gotten twenty two it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving and that's a to me is a real drawback i wish i would you know i could settle for twenty eight or um-hum but uh the um the frills on that car are nice but they're not necessary for me except air conditioning in this area uh in Washington DC area it gets hot and humid um-hum really um-hum it's really humid yeah uh so air conditioning is definitely uh definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer um but i um i i don't need uh you know power windows are nice but i don't need them right although i must say when you're driving in the east and there are all these toll roads come into a toll road push that button down it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up instead of having to crank it um-hum crank yeah um-hum yeah but or you know if you want to have open windows to be able to open if you're alone in the car just to press buttons and but you know i've lived all these years without them i probably could have lived a little longer right you don't have to stretch that's true uh one of the things that we have uh we've liked when we've gotten a new car and this this used car has it is a sun roof um-hum and those are really nice in in good weather that's right so uh so i guess if we get a new car it definitely would have to have antilock antilock brakes i'd love to get uh an air bag um-hum and a sun roof and uh just so it'd be a good solid car i guess that's those are my my major criteria everything else is you know a luxury and they make the car more expensive but they often add more things to repair when things go wrong right so uh but if you were to buy a new car now a brand new car what would you look for um yeah like you said antilock brakes and air bag and uh i'd i'd really like to have a car that's dependable um-hum yeah yeah that that you drive you know like a American made car that's as dependable as Mercedes or something you know that's isn't that true it's it's funny um uh that you use uh the Audi's German and i have to say it has been pretty dependable um-hum yeah sometimes one advantage of an American made car is if you get stuck anywhere most local garages can fix you up yeah they have parts uh-huh but once you get if you start once you get something fancy you get stuck somewhere off of the main area you can be really and the parts i know the Audi parts are terribly expensive right um-hum i i mean it just i shudder i would not get the Audi again just for that reason but i would love i wish an American an American that you know engineering would make something as solid as a German car you know we certainly have the technology but it's amazing when we bought this Audi i mean everything is more solid in it right uh it you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic um-hum and i know and i i and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a for a solid car i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up right but uh do you need air conditioning down there yes we really do because even today it's it's supposed to get up into the nineties so yeah oh we've had eleven days in a row over ninety um-hum they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that oh well listen i enjoyed talking with you it was nice talking to you okay and enjoy enjoy your car yeah have a nice summer thank you you too it's going to be a hot one okay bye-bye yeah bye  okay have you participated in anything like that well a little bit we mostly do our newspapers we keep our newspapers and stuff like that and we take them to be recycled um-hum uh we we have a pretty nice recycling center uh in our city now and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there they're open like two days a week and you can just take it up there and drop it off it's kind of fun and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to um-hum yeah help the earth i guess and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them yeah yeah my husband was complaining the other day because he says every time i turn around you're telling me some new rule about recycling like yesterday i was telling him you have to you're supposed to squish the plastic jugs before you take them up there you're supposed to what every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule that we're you're supposed to squish up the you know like collapse the plastic jugs instead of taking them up there solid but what are you supposed to do with them oh okay and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags they won't take those we like to put our just put our newspapers in a paper bag you know and then carry them up there that way and we have to bring the paper bags back every time uh-huh yeah but they won't take them do you um take your papers somewhere or does someone pick them up we we usually collect a you know collect a quite a bit and then we take them take them in uh-huh we um we don't take our cans up to that center though our aluminum cans we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them yeah we don't we don't um use aluminum cans so uh-huh we generally don't have those to do yeah it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth yeah worth bothering to go in and do do you um have any ideas on anything that would make you know they they charge you you know it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage uh-huh and i know a lot of people it would would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup and some communities are trying to do that now and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling right they they charged you by by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a landfill yeah that'd be a good idea that that might be a better way to do it and then people would would know that it was gonna cost them money to not sort their trash yeah right yeah that would be a real good motivation for people you know because then it would then it would make monetary sense to them you know to say hey you know if i just spend the time to to sort this out where this stuff can be recycled then i don't have to pay for them hauling it off right yeah my father was telling me about some program he read about where you buy your bags like you buy your garbage bag from the city and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything so however many bags of garbage you throw away that's how many you have to pay for uh-huh oh yeah that's about the same kind of thing yeah yeah that would be a real good idea i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of they're talking about going to curbside pickup in our in our city Rowlett Texas do you know do you where that is where do you live oh okay yes and i don't know if they decided to do or not but i think they said it was gonna add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that although i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even break even point without charging people yeah it seems like they would be able to i don't know um i guess it just depends on how they manage it i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff the center that their got now where you take your stuff in i think i think that should be making some money uh-huh since they just have to hire someone to man it a few hours a week yeah and they sell i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it yeah but i wish that uh uh more of the cans you know like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable i don't a lot of that's that recyclable steel and i don't know anybody that takes that yeah that's true this the my husband likes Pepsi and those cans are steel instead of aluminum so we can't can't ever recycle those i think it's a good reason to quit buying it hm nah i didn't know that because we just usually if we're gonna um buy sodas they're in the the two liter bottles yeah that's what we buy the most of unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to put the cans in a cooler yeah but well that's all i can really think about for recycling it was good talking to you um bye okay okay all right bye-bye  there you go what do you think invades your privacy oh well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something you know that that try to sell you the newspaper and uh what carpet cleaning and uh what else roof repair uh and enough well i think it's a waste of paper the people that always leave uh junk mail and because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time probably eighty percent of the the junk mail that you get is is um something that you don't need and the same way with those calls what is it oh MCI MCI really does even when you tell them no they keep calling back MCI what's that MCI it's the long distance telephone company oh now see i i really don't have much trouble with i just say no thank you and hang up um-hum well they won't they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason they just keep calling back i had a carpet service call up three times um-hum all within in an hour but i uh i do telemarketing uh-huh so uh i'm very polite and i just say no thank you and say no thank you very politely and i hang up and uh don't bother me after that yeah so i think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me and they try to get information out of me like the Census Bureau United States Census Bureau that bothered me um-hum oh yeah um-hum i didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even right that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government and i don't understand what their need to know is um-hum and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy if somebody wants personal information out of me but telephone calls i figure they don't bother me one way or the other um-hum uh i know when i do telemarketing um i'm a soft person if if someone says i am not interested i'll just say fine and back out um-hum and i make very good sales but i'm not uh as i said i'm not half as pushy as these people because i don't really care i mean if if they're not interested fine you know that's it you can't force them to be right no and i'm not pushing something down their throat that uh i don't think is a good item anyway that i don't think i could do anyway uh-huh but i feel like oh movie stars or sure it's part of their i guess they're portray being a movie star they get themselves in these rag sheets but uh i think they go too far i think that's invasion of privacy oh yeah because they follow them around twenty four hours a day yeah oh yeah and you know they do Ted Kennedy of course he's breaking the law all the time so it's a different story then you know but but Ed McMahon i mean you know who cares about Ed McMahon he's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air you know and he has a chauffeur maybe he drinks but he never drives a car either you know it's not the same with Johnny Carson no i think my seriously my classification of of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information um-hum and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers without your and without your permission um-hum right this to me is is my invasion of privacy right anytime i can honestly say no or throw the paper away or but you can always write to uh oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail that i've done because i don't want junk mail anyway so i wrote to them when it came on the air so i don't get any of that bull that it works by the way oh good but uh the telephone doesn't bother me because i leave it half the time on uh you know answering service anyway unless i'm home um-hum so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other but i think that's the only bottom line thing that i dislike because it does other than the U S Census um what was it oh the the carpet place that called me three times um-hum that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place and called me three times i mean one should be sufficient that's right but if people don't use the telephone it's like i don't know when the police has their project going and i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things that's the only way i know um-hum and uh that's it well you have to have the telephone but you can't you know and and it's sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want well see there's no way of knowing that's you know that's the problem like the product i sell um-hum uh i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation the only way we'd get to them is by telephone um and uh most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide and uh reputable and they know that hey we're backing it one hundred percent um-hum but if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it because your normal companies that offer it do not offer it in the amounts that we do and they'd never have it then at that point hm uh-hum because we offer it in a very low you know quantity so i mean i i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned but it is nerve racking i mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone but at least as i said you can always say no thank you right um-hum i gather you get a lot of telephone calls sometimes yeah some days it just rings off the wall yes yes yes in other words you own your own home no no uh-huh i think that's where they hit most of us like i own my own home and you just know about what time like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time but uh i don't know i haven't been able to figure that out something else to do about it when they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and i'll give you a free something or another um-hum my answer is no thank you i don't need it and they say well don't you want to know what's free and i say no if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that they're taking something away from me and i don't like that right yeah even if i guess it's for coupons they they have a survey they run and it i guess it one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking uh-huh and they ask that you know they start out and they ask you even even to your income level i think that's you know whether you buy a TV dinner or not i don't think it has anything to do with what  well i always think i'm paying too much taxes how about you yeah oh definitely seems like although at least Texas doesn't have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe there'll be a day that they're going to uh enact this i think uh the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax yeah i think that uh we probably will have to have to uh have a state income tax because uh Texans don't approve of such things as lotteries uh uh well i i come i come here from New York and New York had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state uh-huh uh although we in New York we had to pay a state and a city uh tax and it was really a great relief when i got to Texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax though yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because other states take chunk quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so you're uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference right it sure does make make a difference a little more take home here uh-huh do you live in Dallas yeah Richardson area oh you do oh yeah i work at uh well mainly the Expressway Site is where i work oh i do too oh okay okay and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite yeah you know some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there uh or up to Collin County somewhere that you're getting out of the um Dallas County area because what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax uh-huh eight point five um-hum which yeah that really is pretty high is it the same is it uh less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County i think so although i really i don't go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience uh yeah i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up um-hum um-hum yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax and you can't do that anymore yeah it really hit me yesterday i had uh air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty two dollars for um air conditioning service where they uh-huh uh checked it and charged recharged it and put one one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they gave it it was like seven dollars and something and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldn't believe it and it the tax you know really hits you yeah yeah that's true although i wish i wish you know overall they'd try the lottery again when did you first come to Texas um-hum and then oh it's been i've been here for nine years okay well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty two really where'd you come from um well Ohio kind of my parents live in Ohio i had lived a little while in Michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh more years than i ever did in Michigan oh uh-huh um-hum um-hum well uh i did visit uh Michigan i visited Kalamazoo once my sister used to live there oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on Sunday uh-huh that's true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldn't close uh remember that well i'd say they closed maybe eight or nine o'clock the department stores on Christmas eve but uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and uh-huh and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one o'clock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was Christmas eve and when i came to Dallas uh-huh i thought i was going to do that Christmas eve and i couldn't find hardly anything open after five o'clock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck were you shocked like oh no i'm stuck i need to buy stuff and i think Target was the one that stayed open later than anybody anybody else and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there but boy i was i was really shocked and then another shock i had well when i went to uh to buy a slice of pizza and found out that i had to buy the whole pie uh-huh oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but yeah now but they but back then they didn't when i first came no right anyway well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think it's taken us Yankee's influence down here to get them to uh come to the the the you know the correct decade here and century um yeah i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car right right i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if you if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly uh-huh uh-huh it yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and uh uh-huh that would have been enough to to make me me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up couple a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems oh well i don't smoke so i don't really know what the taxes are and stuff on it well well they're like two or i i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now um maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes uh well i believe it's a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think it's maybe thirteen or something huh gee uh because i remember we went to to Oklahoma to this this bingo place this Choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton for uh uh ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount they're cheaper there well because it's you know the Indians i don't think they pay tax oh in in Oklahoma oh i got you okay and uh it was a Indian it well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there although i didn't see very many Indian people in there there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's it's uh-huh the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth i won a dollar yeah i had fun uh couple people on the bus won some money one one guy won two well how'd you do a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right  all right uh well that's an interesting topic yes it is do you have young people yeah i've got three small children yes three small ones okay would you feel like those youngsters could be raised with a balanced life understanding all of the aspects of their lives if they did not perform some kind of public service yeah well i basic feeling is that everybody performs some sort of public service no matter what career path they take unless they are just absolute dropouts um-hum and uh part of my reaction is that uh some people particularly those that are gifted and talented uh and highly motivated uh ought to get on with their lives and uh and do the thing that they do best um-hum you know if somebody wants to become a doctor or a uh dedicated professional and they're serious about it uh i hate to see their their lives put on hold for a year or two while they uh uh they do something that's uh not down their alley well you're looking at it from a perspective of something equivalent to the draft where you take two years out of your life and and serve as as a a a military in the military however they didn't say that it would be required required to be two consecutive years what about the option yeah of requiring these young people to have two years of public service in association perhaps with their education and that they get you know how we have uh life credits in college um-hum experience credits why could those not apply in exactly that way you actually are using that as a part of your college education and it's a quote public service course um-hum well i think uh i hate to see things mandated for people because i like to see people have their choice freedom of choice let's not get into that subject uh uh-hum well it would be like an elective yeah it would be the equivalent of an elective do you want to serve in the Peace Corps or do you want serve uh maybe you know on a on a some sort of a social agency where you do volunteer work or perhaps you'd like to do reading for the blind for a couple of years in your spare time um-hum and it might be uh three hours a week that's what a class is yeah three or four hours a week then they have a balanced view i think of what is out there i know that a lot of young people are raised in a very protected environment mom and dad don't want them exposed to the kinds of things that they had to endure or they had to go through they want a better life for their kids and they do put them in this wonderful little cocoon and then when they get out in the real world and life does give them a good smack they go to their knees um um-hum because they haven't had the experience in helping people therefore they don't have experience in seeking help or in being helped gracefully uh i i myself have done a lot of volunteer work but i am very apprehensive about accepting help um-hum yeah i'm very independent and i don't care much for that and i raised my children to be very independent and yet they did their share of volunteer work we went to the nursing homes and carried Christmas gifts and we visited sick people those are all good community service behaviors and activities and they don't require a big bite of your life um-hum yeah i think one of the reactions i had was when i graduated from college i was all set to uh go into military service and and do my part um-hum and uh when it at the end of my four years and i got my degree and i started talking to uh some of the recruiters for different companies um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh one of them sat me down and he said hey you know what are you going to do in two years in the military uh where are you going to go and and what's going to happen to you um-hum um-hum um-hum and they persuaded me that uh i could serve my country better by going to work for one of the uh military industrial companies in direct support of uh military operations um-hum defense uh-huh and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret uh not going into military service right right but you did serve yeah but in in a different respect and that's what i'm saying you don't have to go into the Peace Corps in order to be of of service to the community yeah yeah and uh everybody has there uh soapbox i have a lot of people come around to the house uh uh trying to solicit funds for some environmental action or preserve some form of wildlife um-hum and i turn them down uh because i i choose to contribute directly in terms of energy and i've been involved in research diving on several occasions to uh um-hum um-hum uh gain information about the environment and it contributes to the uh body of knowledge so i'd rather put my money in that form directly and i think a lot of people do things like that that uh um-hum um-hum um-hum they have their own applications that get them involved in the public oh yeah i do a great deal of you know i would rather expend the personal energy than just shell out a few bucks and let my conscience rest i feel like that you um-hum you i don't know the the benefit to you is much of greater value if you are physically or emotionally involved in what you're doing it's it's no big deal to be emotionally involved in writing a check yeah i mean you know you don't really get involved and you don't really comprehend what you're accomplishing um-hum and i think that's important and that's the reason that i think that there should be some provision even if it's not mandatory yeah at least provide the avenue through which young people can do volunteer work even if it is not a two year stint in the Peace Corps uh yeah well i think an awful lot is available at the present time i have a niece who's with me for the summer um-hum and uh she had done volunteer work for the Sierra Club um-hum in uh years past um-hum and she currently has a summer job with them so she's um-hum she's getting paid for what she used to do as a volunteer but she's getting more more actively involved with the uh Sierra Club um-hum yeah yeah but that's that's the thing that she wants to do you got to remember though the nature of the person we're when we're involved with here you you can expect someone like that perhaps to be willing to volunteer to get expend the energy to go out and find um-hum the area where they match very well yeah but it might be of interest to put in some sort of a formal system like they do the screening system in the military service okay you know what are your interests and what are your aptitudes let's see if we can match you to a job that you prefer um-hum particularly with you have the education to deal with it i don't know that may or may not be uh a useful choice but i do know that there are a great deal of young people out there who would say why do i want to go you know out and get mosquito bit and sleep sleep on a hard ground when i can sit here in this cushy bed and not go out and and uh i can have my music and drive my cars and have fun through the summer yeah and there are a lot of th em who just do not have that sense of consciousness and i think maybe something in place might build that sense  um what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the Boston areas well the the the major major major cause it seems up here is simply i live right on the ocean so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland but the major cause here and we always seem to and it seems to be validated by the press is the car pollution we don't have too much industrial pollution um-hum yeah yeah uh car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that that i can really put my finger on here um that isn't the same in the Washington area because we don't have any major um industry except for uh government and services and the the transportation situation is such that uh all the car pollution is is absolutely awful um also the worth of the hub of three airports in this general area there is uh National Dulles and then uh Baltimore Washington and it interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from uh uh airplanes is extraordinary is that so i didn't know that yeah and that's always something that you know you just don't real you don't think about well most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution uh but the uh apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes is a very significant factor yeah i would think so you know uh i i guess it talked about all types of pollution i happen to read just read something the other day at least in the Boston paper there were three things that that come to note one is that the carbon fluorides that are uh being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer and again and now they've located another one or rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere so car um so i'm quite concerned i don't think it's involved any longer with with uh hair sprays or those those no i think it's now is what uh from what i understand it's air conditioning units and and we certainly turned into an air conditioned society yeah yeah um-hum society has especially recently yeah i know in Florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned and i do quite a bit of business in Washington and i mean you know what it's like here oh yeah it's quite is is the it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned yeah yeah yeah we just had the and and i guess refrigerators are the same way they release that that's right so solutions to this would be i i you know improved yeah well well i guess the first the to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get getting people upset about animal rights yeah i mean this is so so basic it's human rights in the sense but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused but demanding that um uh we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward um improvement of polluting vehicles and not just cars but also buses um planes that something can be done i mean i can't imagine that well if we can't send people to the moon that we can't improve these things well i i think yeah no i think that it can be done simply because uh uh we've we've every car now in America that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter converter yeah um-hum and no lead gas was came to the pumps and and that's been done there's the lead pollution has that problem essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was was licked um-hum and i think that there are there there are solutions certainly we don't even need a need a research anymore it's just a matter of passing the law and passing the law depends on how heavy the car industry the automobile lobby is and that uh for buses that's right well and also to make it economically feasible that's right that's right uh and particular also in buses i don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus oh yeah well that that the the smell is awful and but you know i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that diesel fumes actually have less pollutants in them than gasoline fumes that you know um-hum yeah um-hum uh-hum so i guess you're better off sitting behind a bus than a car although i can never i could never uh really a a rationalize that while i was sitting there yeah but even of course in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels yeah i mean i'm i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than we we've taken the intermediate step but i don't think fossil fuels are the answer well we you know up here in New England uh where i've right close to where i live is the Seabrook Nucleus site which is practically a you know guerrilla war up here went on for years um-hum yes i mean uh my my daughters marched in the uh uh against the Seabrook and i kind of uh my feelings were that we needed this bridge to to uh to yeah jump from whatever it was going to be from fossil fuel to whatever it was going to be yeah you don't throw the baby out with the bath water and condemning nuclear use yeah unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years yeah yeah so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left or there isn't and uh and uh i but with the pollution issue uh fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway no uh so you've to look you've got to look elsewhere so uh but it is something that's a little frightening and in fact well i within our family we have said said my husband i have two sons uh well one one is already in college in New England yeah yeah and the other will be going in September and we just feel that when we leave uh this area we're we're going north not south yes uh i like the mentality north and i also like the fresher air up there that's right so i mean that's the way we will be going yeah but um so i i i'd be interested in having spoken with somebody also from the far west on this issue to see how they their attitudes are well since since Texas and Louisiana and uh California that in that ranking order the worst pollutants in America um-hum i mean i read that the other day i mean Louisiana Louisiana for a small state was it was amazing but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine and California seems to be taking steps i mean um-hum you you read about the the fairly fairly stiff laws they put in on cars now they're they're enforcing but uh again uh that didn't occur without a crisis nothing will occur i guess without a crisis the smog and yeah um-hum yeah i mean even California was notorious for its smog years ago before it even was an issu e out here yeah exactly exactly well the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned is the no smoking rules on airplanes and in restaurants and it it really is a pleasure for me although i guess smokers don't think that well that that's that's personal that's personal air pollution but that to me was pollution that was its most personal personal uh pollution that i can think of yes yes yeah well i i definetely definitely advance that well listen i enjoyed speaking with you and let's hope some there are other people that feel the same way surely something happen right on thank y ou bye-bye you're welcome bye-bye  okay hi do do you have lots of credit cards yeah we well we have quite a few but we don't really use them a lot we have well we like a lot of gasoline credit cards because we like to be able to stop you know when we're traveling and stuff wherever there's a station but as far as like MasterCard and Visa uh-huh we don't use those too often what about you um i used to have a ton of gas credit cards and now i have one or two of them but i think i've even let some of them expire but i was living out of the country for a while so i wasn't using them too much and i don't drive that much but i have uh-huh you know MasterCard and Visa and you know i have a MasterCard and an American Express now i got rid of the Visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards but as long as like my right MasterCard is um free as long as you spend about i don't know three thousand dollars a year or something like that and so i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card when i have the choice um-hum yeah and um i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff the stores around here don't let you do it too much oh really and so i don't but i was living in France and there you pay for everything by credit card but it's not really a credit card huh oh is it like an automatic debit or something oh huh it's a it's a debit card yeah and um just you know it's many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash bye thanks um yeah because they're just so well set up with it really yeah we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase but we always have the money set aside already to and then we just pay it off the next month we never pay we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all right well yeah i i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do yeah and you know i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date or this last month i mailed the check to them on the twenty second and they didn't get it until the thirtieth and it was due the twenty fifth gosh uh-huh and yeah so i thought i and so i got hit up with a credit uh finance charge on it which pissed me off yeah because um you know i really did mail it in time right yeah but they have no proof of that i don't i don't want to i'll probably talk to them some more discuss it but i i never um usually never pay finance charges yeah that yeah we we screwed up one time like that too we mailed it and they just never did get it and we had to finally mail them another check i had that hassle one time and i that went on for months and months and months because and they eventually found the check and deposited it and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and um late fees and things like that and i said well i mailed you a check and you eventually did deposit it huh so you know i guess i don't know who the the burden of proof is on yeah i don't either you know it's kind of a because you never do when i pay bills i don't make a Xerox copy of it or i don't no you figure you'll get your check back if you have to um right or i don't get a i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i you know at the bank yeah to have a proof of when i mailed it and i mean you can't do that it'd be ridiculous really i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state you know where if something's wrong right you don't want to end up having to pay for it a couple times i've had to write big credit card companies and say you know i didn't really get this or well you can i don't know what this is right or i returned it so don't charge it yeah well that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer and the computer um yeah didn't wasn't didn't do what these people said it would do we need to just put external cards in and it wouldn't do that so he brought it back to them and they're supposed to modify it uh-huh and so i called the credit card company and said well we haven't really taken possession because it's not useful for us we can't use it uh-huh and then they said well then don't pay it and then a month later i had to dispute it in writing and i was out of the country and got back and i took care of it as soon as soon as we got the computer back and it was okay i mailed off a check but then it was too late so now they're hitting with a finance charge oh but it's sort of you know it's it's half our fault yeah since it well yeah if you filed that letter with them then they'll kind of and so we right if i had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually it would have been okay yeah so i learned that for the next time yeah i am like you too about the yearly fees i don't uh i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card right now both the MasterCard and the Visa we don't have to pay a yearly fee on and uh-huh since we don't pay the interest it doesn't really matter what the interest rate right yeah is to us as long as we don't have to pay that yearly fee now we had American Express cards and my husband had always had that before we got married and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something like that i can't remember but we decided let that one go and yeah well my husband and i both have that and i don't know what we pay for his card i pay i think i have a gold one so i think it's like seventy five dollars for me uh-huh yeah and i'm not quite sure what it is for him but i had really like there nowadays i'm not sure so sure that it's worth it but um in the past there you know there are some places that only take American Express um-hum yeah and then they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card if my husband and i both travel yeah if it you know a couple of plane tickets and a little bit more and you're over the limit on the credit card and um with the American Express they say there is no limit there really is but they tell y ou that but then that was one advantage but that's that's like i don't i think it's seventy five dollars for me and forty for him uh-huh for a year which is a lot yeah be but yeah like you said if you really if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff yeah well we should probably get another um Visa card yeah one another one that's free because there are some like i think AT&T has one that's free if you make two purchases a year it's more worth it uh-huh oh well so yeah that wouldn't be too hard to do yeah and so that's easy enough to do and if that's true that's um it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit yeah and get rid of the American Express because it costs so much have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to be stuck with that we've never had that problem either no no i and i don't understand i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand yeah because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process um-hum and sometimes it comes in right away and it's like oh well i guess i have to pay that too yeah because like many times i'll try i'll buy some things towards the end of the month thinking hey i won't get that bill until the next bill not this bill and it will come in on the next one you have to pay for it right away anyway right yeah but sometimes the is long like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months yeah i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something lot of places have yeah those i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute you charge it yeah immediately yeah but that's what happened with us like we bought a washing machine seven months ago and then i got billed like the next day oh oh gosh it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check but we prefer like with the credit card you get the automatic um one year guarantee so if something breaks things like that yeah that's nice you can uh return it so like the washing machine we bought it in October and you know if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee right and somethings like that are yeah i like that feature and the insurance like if you break it yourself even you know if you buy something that's breakable right or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be and so so that's you know another advantage and then even things like airline tickets you automatically get flight insurance which um you hopefully you never use but like if your baggage but things like if your baggage gets lost yeah you get money for that oh really to buy new bags and things like that oh i didn't know that and yeah when you rent a car you get that and sometimes you get discounts with the cards and so
