 well let's see um i i like to go out to eat i really do but being from Dallas um i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every week month we have a really high turn over rate oh yeah and and this is i mean there are streets just called Restaurant Rows oh really uh you can get everything here from um a very spicy Indian meal to you know the favorite barbecue and and uh just anything your little heart desires around here so here they have to entertain us to make us come back and i guess it's all one big game because you you just never run out of places to go you really don't yeah uh that's good i never really thought about that but uh a good turn over would be sort of nice course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it would be sort of sad to see it go under really and and we go to you know like an older part of town and we just notice how many oh well that restaurant's changed and oh gee there they've changed and oh we've got to go try that one you know and it's it's really you have the pick of the you know the crop here are they big into ambience ambience down there or is it more like uh Texas to me makes it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing oh yeah you know your your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff um you can get that too no they've got everything here from the uh French Room which is ultra ultra to um um yeah right uh-huh Dean Ferrings uh uh restaurant which is the Mansion on Turtle Creek i mean we've got beautiful places to go you can get as dressed up or as you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out um-hum hum so you know i guess uh some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the um um likes Chinese uh-huh and we're always searching around for Chinese and now of course they've added the Taiwanese and and um uh there's you know any any part of the country you want to hit they have got it i mean Vietnamese restaurant we went to you know last week it's great it's good stuff you know but it's so it's very very mixed and uh you know i think um uh-huh if you like food like we do i i don't know if that happened before or after we moved here but um yeah you get a lot of uh great variety of things here yes so but if you were going to a restaurant say um where would you go oh well we had uh we have a lot favorites here uh in Northern Virginia and of course we've got DC to call on you know and there's all sorts of things down there one thing about DC is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where you know it's the guy used to be the cook for the Capitol and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years you know and he's got a big clientele and um oh okay so there are there are some hangouts if you want to see people know it's it's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there's there's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that ah um we don't hang around with them because usually it's you know ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that yeah right so uh but uh my wife has a a friend that work runs one of the restaurants down there and we've been down there and had French cuisine and um i don't know i don't particularly care for that sort of thing just the the type of food just because i do like uh you know getting a meal oh i see and uh most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason i i don't know what they say about Chinese i'm always hungry after a French meal uh that's true too and uh but the the atmosphere is just wonderful you do feel like you've gone out you know and done something when you go to a French restaurant or a restaurant downtown well as out here you might to another place yeah have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied it's not so much a an event you know out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant yeah well and there's they're starting to get a little bit different um they're they're realizing that more of the the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs getting away from the city so there a couple of jazz houses that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that which is kind of nice oh there you go yeah oh we're sort of in the middle of uh the extension of the Cajun country too so we have um a lot of ambience provided by you know the the bands and everything you know like you said jazz bands and things like that you know you go out and you um-hum you eat your crawfish and jambalaya and stuff you know i i really don't like that stuff but my husband does he loves to cook it so he and a friend of his get together and they cook i mean you know like for a bunch of people and yeah right uh-huh and uh it's really in fact we do a lot more entertaining i think at home than we do going out so when we do go out we really you know want to be wowed by um the presentation so to speak right and uh you know but but there are little places um and like i said some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants just to and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around and it's the fastest thing to do and uh-huh yeah so we sort of enjoy the you know both parts because we have two uh two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to uh one's called Captain Pell's um-hum which is a crab house you know being so close to Maryland Maryland is you know a big place for crabs with the with the bay pretty much taking over most of Maryland ah right yeah and um Captain Pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside people just go in there and just pig out and everything and then um the other place is called the Vienna Inn which is uh uh Vienna is a suburb of DC also in Virginia and uh that place is known for the the rudest waitresses in the country are are at the Vienna Inn and uh people go there to be abused i mean just to be abused by the meanest waitress you actually go in there to be abused by the by the waitresses and the bartenders and stuff oh that's a talent and people come all over the country amazed at um the abuse they received and then it's on the honor system you pay totally on the honor system um and so you know you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever and they figure out the bill for you and you're lucky if you get change usually they they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks you know because um got to carry through with the abuse huh they yeah carry on with the abuse they say you need needs mints here guy you don't get any change you know oh gee well that's funny i we just went to an Italian restaurant this um just wonderful and they and it's like being in it i mean i've never been to Italy okay but it's just this big beautiful Italian restaurant very um low key in terms of the people are from California you know so they have their own adaptation of what Italian is i mean but it's it was a wonderful wonderful experience know they have uh women there going to SMU going to uh Southern Methodist Univerisity and and graduating in opera or something like that and they're all singing arias to you and oh wow and just walking around the restaurant singing and they make the food right there so it's display cooking and and uh then they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line for this place and you just take a drink of wine and you know and they don't count that really they just  okay are you a TIer no no no is somebody in your family a TIer no uh my fiancee works for the computers for the government and that's how he got it oh okay so who do you work for i just graduated from college so you don't have any benefits at all to talk about no you're just going to have to imagine what you would like as benefits or what i'm looking for oh okay okay well in in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers no huh-uh didn't get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well no um well i'll tell you a little bit about what TI has as benefits we do have uh like most companies we have medical insurance although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more um what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to um set hospitals in the area they call it network hospitals they're hospitals oh yeah i've heard of that yeah they're hospitals that they're uh agreeing with uh TI that they'll be a certain rate you know for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep costs you know costs down uh-huh now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors so it's almost like a um uh an HMO yeah you know kind of thing that uh only certain doctors are you going to be allowed to go to and get the full coverage if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get um-hum we have some dental coverage now um but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile Like i've had a couple of crowns recently and if you didn't have the extra dental plus um you only get like a third of your cost which can be kind of expensive with a crown so i i pay yeah it can yeah i pay for the extra dental plus so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more uh-huh um we do have pension although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that oh i like to think about that after you've been working for a while and you look at your pension account and you go is that all that's in there i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out um we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago um it's not an i R A it's called a four oh one K plan it's kind of like pension you put in so much money and then TI um meets you half way up to a certain maximum so like i put in a dollar they put in fifty cents so uh-huh that grows pretty good and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan um-hum course you can buy stock in the company but you know that's not always a real for sure kind of thing course not always safe yeah especially with this one you know it kind of goes up and down i don't know if it's any different than other companies but you hate to have it fluctuate and like you know last year it was forty dollars a share and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share and you go gee i'm losing money doesn't quite feel as good um-hum yeah and we get you know vacation normally after you're here for six months and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you and it's one nice thing about TI is after you've been here uh for five years you get three weeks um-hum oh that's nice which a lot of places make you work like ten years or so before you get that much yeah uh-huh and we get some we get uh decent holidays um we at Thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice to make a nice long weekend and at Christmas we always get two days at Christmas they float it around depending on which day of the week Christmas falls on uh-huh so that's nice so you always get two days at Christmas a lot of people just take you know that week i normally take that week somehow you know yeah you only have to take three days of vacation and you get the whole week at Christmas time yeah well um i can just tell you like you know from my dad and my fiancee like my dad well there's twelve kids in my family whoa okay so uh the the dental was very important you know to my dad but um i think they took the dental away now he worked for United Telephone System it's you know it's just another you know telephone network uh-huh and they took the dental away but now i think they're going to start getting into eye uh-huh oh yeah yeah yeah i think uh um i don't use the services but yeah i think sometime last year or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage you get discounts on uh glasses and i'm not quite sure there's certain places you can go to that have uh discounts for people that work here uh-huh so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that yeah and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock but my fiancee he's on that same kind of pension as what you said only for everything he puts in they'll match it um-hum up to a certain amount yeah like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar you know and then he's only allowed i think yeah i don't know if it's maybe five percent or something like that that he's allowed to put in and they'll match it so and um he works for the did you ever hear of the National Bureau of Standards um-hum okay well he works for them they changed their name now but that's that's where he works and um yeah he his vacation is really nice he's going to be there three years at the end of this month and he'll be getting three weeks vacation gee that's pretty decent yeah yeah okay you know of course it's it's for the government and he has all the holidays off right and you get some extra ones federal workers always seem to get you know you get Columbus Day and Veterans Day and those ones that you couldn't really care about so much but you get the day off anyhow yeah uh-huh he has it really nice it's nice where he works and um he seems to be very happy you know like his hospi talization and you know he has all that and with his doctors and stuff they have um a list of doctors that the employees can go to and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor you know and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any oh yeah okay but you have to go you know to certain ones but still that works out really nice you know yeah we're doing an HMO right now um and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars so but so you know sometime sometimes when you go you know the prescription like my husband always takes which is kind of like you know contact stuff only better um you that's like a buck a capsule that's not bad either um-hum so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirty four dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings then there's other times that you know maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars and you pay five anyhow um-hum so it isn't a percentage but sometimes you work you know you manage to make  well i usually keep up with news by watching ABC news on television and reading the papers here the local Dallas Morning News and then i also take the Wall Street Journal do you get a chance to do it at home or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work do you have a chance to look through the Wall Street Journal i'm not sure what you do yeah well i well i did at the office i generally catch the Wall Street Journal at lunchtime i use part of my lunch period to uh read the Wall Street Journal um well the then uh i read the the newspaper at home generally in the evening i'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning i understand that well and you have a little bit better newspaper The Dallas Morning News is a good paper Lubbock is kind of small and the AJs uh kind of dominant there's no competition so what you get is what you get we used to take the paper every day and i finally quit taking it because it stacked up i never got around to reading it and so i try to take you know weekend papers and then during the week i catch up you know on the radio on the way to work or if i'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home and hopefully i'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where i can kind of get a recap on TV uh yeah that's uh what we do to it we're never never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television so we catch the ten o'clock news but i catch the news on the radio coming no yeah to and from work but radio news is is rather short uh most of the news stations most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour it is uh-huh and if you catch the news stations uh you don't catch that much in the car oh i see yeah but uh i well uh it's frustrating to me because i really wish that i did have more i don't know uh what do i want to say i wish that i was around more news it's frustrating when i don't know what's going on i feel like it's hit and miss and i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis somebody will say oh did you hear about this that happened last week and it might be local and it might be national and i'm like no i missed that one yeah i have the same situation i tried the news magazines like Time Newsweek US News and World Report and yeah they'd just stack up i wouldn't find time to read them you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on on the stories or else all of a sudden you look and there's three uh three weeks worth laying on the coffee table um-hum and you wind up throwing them out without reading them because it's too much trouble to try and catch up so yeah that's true that's true have to depend i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that i don't think that uh my children even read newspapers other than the TV guide section of the there's is all uh strictly television news uh oh no a little bit that worries me because i feel like the news is so biased and yes they report facts and yes you can get an idea of what's going on but oh yeah you know it's an and i wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out but so many times you get well uh this is my opinion of what he meant by that and i'm like who are you to judge you know just report the facts yeah right right it's the same thing with the news magazines like Time and and the other magazines it's hard to celebrate uh to celebrate to separate um-hum the news from the comment because in the way it's presented their opinions is printed or presented as being the news yes um-hum and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news and i feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized i feel like they focus too much on things that i don't know you know so much during the Gulf War they would ask questions that uh you wouldn't want broadcast it's like if you tell us the answer to that you're telling our enemy what your strategy is but they keep asking these questions and i thought it was really well i don't know asinine actually stupid that's right that's right well so many of them also come through and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time whether it be the homeless or uh cancer or whatever and then they devote uh an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal axe to grind um yes and uh i particularly the local television uh i know the the Wednesday's Child Bit i agree and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something i'm not saying that's not important but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects yeah yeah that's true that's true and it's frustrating yes so so i guess i guess when i get to listen to the news it's it's probably television or radio i see very little paper but i i don't get to see that as much as i want and when i do i'm wondering why i wanted to see it so bad so that's yeah that makes sense we uh again like i say by the time i read the newspaper it's the the it's that morning's news from the day before and i'm reading it in the evening so i'm a i'm about a day behind most of the time anyway yeah exactly exactly yeah well i'm glad that it makes me feel like i'm not alone though in the world i i used to think that i was probably the only one that just i don't know was running around so much i look at other uh women workers or men at work that have kids and families and i'm like how do they seem so together all the time i always feel like i'm running a rat race yeah yeah we we so i guess news is just part of that rat race for me and my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own it's always there's something going on all the time uh you don't really have time to sit down and yeah and thoroughly read a newspaper as a matter of fact i read the Sunday paper this evening we had such a busy day yesterday exactly well didn't find time to even read it yeah that's incredible too yeah well that's about all then well i appreciate talking to you nice talking with you same to you have a good evening bye-bye  so well she lives in Utah so oh uh-huh uh-huh that's the way we always were we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up yeah so you know well i guess we're going to talk about children today okay let's do it so you ready my children are all gone already they're they're all out on their own uh-huh so uh do you want to start first do you you uh do you work okay no i don't i stay home most of the time but i know that it's very difficult to to find good help sometimes when and especially when your when you want your children to be taken care of uh-huh uh-huh right um you know there's a my neighbor she tends children though and and um there's a big controversy whether they should have to um have a a law a law to have them certified or or not and um you know there's pros and cons on both side of that because if they were then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing or some kind of something to be okay okay get an okay seal right um-hum yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers that's right that's right but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be you know the individual incidence or something yeah um-hum uh now usually when i have someone tend um my oldest tends for me now if i go somewhere but before uh-huh how old is your oldest he's almost a teenager yeah he's he's very good um but um oh well he's plenty big enough then before that i would i would use uh kids from our church and they did a good job for me um um-hum um um-hum um-hum but i've never had to leave them like in a day care center or anything and i've been very lucky just be able to stay home um-hum that's the way with me i i worked four years one time but but my last two children were uh both entering high school age um-hum and uh they were of course gone while i was working working so it wasn't a problem i saw and i stayed home the rest of the time yeah i so i didn't have that problem either now i have my my oldest daughter she has two children and they've been in day care uh she works full time um-hum yeah that's hard it it's difficult but yet she's the type of person that i don't know if she'd be happy staying at home well some people aren't uh-huh she uh she surprised me though she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do you know with with the family because she yeah the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children so she uh she spends a lot of quality time i think when she is with with the children oh is that is that right i think that's really important and uh she they've used the day care most of the time they tried once once they had a lady come in um-hum and uh she she also had a small child she brought with her and it did not work out uh at all it she thought it was going to she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out in the morning but uh uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh the the lady called and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble and this baby is the is the most pleasant uh real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually and and she was having problems with her and so she called and said things were okay settled down and was all right yeah yeah well my daughter decided to come and check and things weren't okay oh her her one son was watching the soapies which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies oh um-hum and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out oh dear and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby and so that ended that episode uh she was most upset over over oh yeah finding this yeah i bet so uh she they kind of had decided that the day care was better there is uh um-hum more people involved more than one adult they and the age groups are separated and uh well nannies have been an option uh but i know that at day care they have more of a a routine like at uh maybe in um preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on um-hum hum yeah story time uh-huh uh and the this one has been particularly nice it uh it kept track of what they did and they would tell the parents what they did that day you know if they said anything or did anything so it kind of it um-hum kept it gave you an idea of what your child was progressing in or doing yeah i often i always thought that if you were checking into a day care that you would be good to get references yeah uh on people that had been in that day care but was no longer there yeah yeah because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying you know if there was a problem they they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was oh i think so because if they were still there you know they might not they might not say anything right right and uh other than how else how do you judge other than from what others have uh what you see uh the cleanliness and that type of thing you can't really you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something and usually they aren't at that age uh um-hum um-hum you know um but it would be real difficult to pick you you know to find one and decide uh-huh well i know i uh about three years ago i i tended some children um and uh you know i i wondered if i would have to be certified or wheth er they'd just bring them and and we got to where well we were just friends and so they said no don't do that we'll just bring them um-hum um um-hum um-hum and then if it was a problem then then we'd sit down and talk about it but it never happened to be a problem and and so things worked out okay and their kids played with my kids and it worked out well um-hum yeah yeah uh it worked out good i'm going to i've decided i'm going to babysit my two granddaughters oh since they'll be going back at the end of the month and that's great i'm going to give it a try i i i sell Avon and Stanley products and oh uh-huh i've got that worked out my husband he's retired so he's going to deliver my products so i'll do my orders and that by phone well that'll be great yeah so uh i'll be able to keep that up a little bit but i think i think i'll enjoy yeah i bet you'll have some great experiences with them doing it yeah i i think i'll enjoy i i guess i kind of miss having a baby around a kid around or something yeah yeah sure why not and and you know the grandparents uh i always hear it's always fun when you can send them home at the end of the day instead of right that's right well they do say you enjoy them more uh somebody somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun they'd of had them first well that's right well uh my husband's mother lives right over here and she takes care of them sometimes for me and uh-huh uh-huh and just is a lovely lady and have always appreciated when she's sat with them uh-huh yeah my daughter always said she would not let me babysit because you do hear grandparents complaining and oh uh-huh you know because they're stuck with their grandchildren so much uh-huh but they're the ones that complain a lot are the first  okay uh could you give me your thoughts on uh on any trends well uh longer term trends i think that uh like past oh ten or fifteen years uh there there there seems to be a a trend and maybe it's longer than that of of politics is is strictly a what can i get for me or what can i get for my group and not what's best for the whole uh kind of a thing uh does that make any sense or yeah um you're talking about the uh political action committees and uh i mean the yeah political action committees that and i think it i think it ties in with the the budget deficit that uh the Congress and and uh is is they get they get reelected by what they do for their districts uh in terms of bringing in and bringing in money and and uh right in order to bring in money for their district they've got to vote to spend it in other districts and and uh the heck with the overall uh deficit and it yeah districts is geographical but it can just as well be interest groups in terms of of uh whether it's Social Security or or anything that that uh it's it's what what you get for your constituents one way or another not what what's necessarily good overall yeah we're uh we feel it up here in New England because we're small states so we don't have the represent and representatives that yeah that the larger states have you know like like Texas and California um but we've got we have political clout only because of the tenure of the people that are in there like for uh uh the sub yeah like Texas yeah yeah building you know Gratin and they're building down in Newport now yeah okay but you but once uh somebody's got to do it somebody's got to build the subs and i guess Virginia can do it also in fact i've got a a yeah the latest contract that was awarded Virginia sued or has got a lawsuit against uh Gratin to stop construction because it was unfairly obtained or something like that you know yeah and uh yeah but let's see you you do have uh long time uh long time power people there in terms of i mean Rhode Island's got uh right this um Powell and Chaffey and and and been in the senate forever and uh Powell yep yep yep but when those when those people leave uh the power's going to go um there isn't really anything here because we're not really big enough so the economy is going to going to suffer i think because the the yeah yeah the base that New England always had the textile base the uh the uh costume jewelry base most of that now has moved out here to overseas to overseas or down south so we're prone to yep yep um uh recessions like the rest of the country were before we were kind of stable uh the political power is the only thing that can stabilize it at least i think up up this neck of the woods yeah yeah yeah but there's too many now uh political action committees and where the money is coming from is coming from those states that have the big industries that can afford to contribute to those yeah so those are going to get uh uh the squeaky wheel gets the oil they're going to they're going to catch it and somebody has to do it somebody has to do the work like Boeing or General Dynamics or wherever wherever they happen to be you know you've you've only got a few plane factories or yeah well well i guess i guess i'm a little more cynical than that i'm not i'm not sure that it that all of it has to be done even but uh well i i think they should be outlawed myself the the the packs i don't think they should be uh but well in it well i but i i mean in terms of of not necessarily all the planes that the government buys they really need or not necessarily well in in in in particular uh planes and i true you know i see this here in in Texas that that uh got uh oh i can't even remember which of the companies it is but they've they've got a they've got a tilt rotor uh plane that they've developed and they want to sell but developed for the defense department department and defense department is saying well no we we don't we don't really need it it's going to be too expensive and it's not going to do what we need and oh like the yeah yep yep the the Texas people are fighting to have it built for just to just to keep and create jobs here right yep rather than because it's uh you know they they they certainly use the words well it's needed but but uh yeah look at look at the tanks now look at that New Abrams tank yeah and i have no idea what the cost is uh five million ten million no for each one now you can make you can make a a missile or or a hand held rocket that can take one of those out pretty effectively yep what what do we need all the tanks for i mean you can make you make you can make probably a thousand rockets for each tank right yeah yeah and you can give a thousand rockets of a relatively uninvolved uninvolved untrained uh person and he can take he can take one of those tanks out yep but yet i'm not sure who is it Chrysler that makes the tanks or one of one of the i think i i think maybe so and i think that or and i don't think we really need all that hardware and again and again like the Stealth bombers and and some of these things they they put on their drawing boards and they never fly or they never they never run right yeah yeah yeah yeah um is it because of of political clout yeah rather than need i think in a lot of cases yes yeah yeah but we don't have a watchdog agency to the military overlooks their own testing yeah which is good for us i mean it creates you know we generate a lot of income at TI because of the military contacts right right right you know that's true too but do you see any other trends or particularly interesting events that come to your mind um the savings and loans crisis yeah the political trends there are are most most of these people are lawyers that are now in in uh the government whether it's state or local most of them i guess you've been reading about the problems we've had in Rhode Island where the governor closed down a lot of the the uh credit unions and banks yeah because of uh it was privately insured but but stated well it certainly did certainly did when he first did it but i haven't heard about it for a while i was at are there yeah there's still a lot of people that uh still can't get their money out can't yeah um they still have to pay their their bills like their mortgages and things they slip them under the door to the bank and but yet they can't get any of their savings so it's it's it's a little bit difficult but most of the people there the trend was that on almost every single board of the institutions that were closed they were state legislators huh yeah so they had a conflict of interest because they tried to get through uh a bill stating that they had to have federal insurance rather than private insurance and it was squashed yep yeah  what would you serve at a dinner party well that would have to depend on the uh number of people and the nature of the party fairly small parties with people that i know i tend to be a little bit more casual and i would tend to okay to uh serve things that were buffet style perhaps we'd have uh oh i like those little little cocktail sausages in barbecue sauce or or maybe a sausage ball uh crackers and dips chips maybe uh uh-huh probably have some kind of a of a salad uh that's easy to pick up and spread uh-huh fresh veggies probably uh possibly uh blocks of cheese and chunks of uh deli meat have to include some fruit of some kind i prefer berries uh like sugared grapes and things that are very attractive to set out on a on a table uh-huh a little bit more formal dinner party you might have just a little bit more formal setting i don't have a lot of formal dinner parties so i can't tell you a whole lot about that right but i tend to be very lazy and want to do what is easy but looks and tastes good so yeah ours would lean more toward uh i guess monetary concerns rather than the formality of the deal if if we were having a bunch of friends over if there were six to ten coming over we'd end up serving anything with chicken due due to its cheapness uh-huh uh-huh and uh oh you can run a a a regular spaghetti or even a chicken spaghetti type casseroles anything that that can be spread over a large number of people for a few number of dollars uh-huh and uh oh if it's smaller and and for a given occasion my wife will will end up cooking a variety of of uh shall i say more fancy foods as it were but i grew up in a in a family that that had a a few formal things but uh my mother was deaf and and hung around the house a lot so she developed a uh a cooking habit that was just unmatched by most of her peers and we ate some very uh-huh good food and then large quantities of it and even to this day with the two of them uh retired and and none of the kids at home and uh-huh they still keep a large refrigerator totally full i i just can't imagine i mean even our refrigerator with a family of four does not have the food content that they manage to do so she still likes to to cook a large uh variety of foods um uh-huh my wife on the other hand comes out of the military type family and and they were always on the go and they never really had a a formal setting as it were and so she tends to cook a little more uh informal type things and when we have friends over it's usually just for a uh a light pretty much what we would eat anyway a light informal meal and they usually bring something a desert or a salad or whatever and uh uh-huh i do like the uh my wife's motto when she finds something she wants to experiment on she'll experiment on company because usually they're polite enough to eat it anyway instead of the family you know so so we do get some weird concoctions on occasion that she'll she'll experiment on things she has a real uh nice repertoire of uh desserts and uh uh-huh uh-huh i like to like to eat desserts well in recent years i have become far more conscience of conscious of balancing the diet and having healthy foods if i were having people over i would want hm healthy food to be one of the considerations most of my friends really would prefer a bowl of fruit as opposed to a big gooey cake hm interesting uh they would prefer fresh stick veggies as opposed to chips and dips although there are some hard crust chips and dippers uh yeah and i i'd like to have a little bit of nutrition content in the foods i'll be careful but for example about the kind of cracker that i pick to go under a spread hm i may be concerned about the number of calories that are going into the spread i know i watch my weight and i'm sure that most of my friends do too and i appreciate somebody being conscious of that when i go visit so i do try to cook more healthy than i did even five years ago five years ago i let my palate dictate uh now i'm more conscious along with everybody else yeah yeah that's interesting that's an interesting discipline i haven't uh i i probably should pay attention to that i i now that i think about it uh it does seem to be a bit of a change in what i've been served at different houses over the years uh about the kind of food uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well there was a time for example that i would've made a big gooey creamy pie for dessert now now i may use an angel food cake with fruit and a light whipped topping uh-huh uh-huh hm far fewer calories and far less cholesterol uh and just as edible very balanced very good yes yes uh-huh uh-huh and just as palatable i love peaches and strawberries and i sure take advantage of them in season yeah that's that's a good deal and uh as far as the the party snacks uh i may fix a trail mix or a caramel popcorn for snacking as opposed to what pure peanuts uh-huh right yeah or or something else that that really is loaded with empty nutrients with empty calories no nutrition yeah popcorn has got to be one of the the most filling and least uh you know bad for you as it were and it seems to be good in all those categories that they're rating these days oh yeah it's a favorite uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah uh-huh that's right few calories and few well if you don't drench it in butter i guess uh-huh well i tend to i i nearly everything i try to balance uh you can take everything to an extreme uh-huh right everything to an extreme and i'm not going to take the flavor and the pleasure out of the food in order to make it quote healthy i'd rather die than eat terrible tasting food right yeah pure oats yeah yeah and there are you know you people whose systems are accustomed to that kind of discipline can actually tolerate it much better than those who are not i know that when i began to add bran to my diet i had terrible bellyache until i until my system became accustomed to it hm interesting and uh by the same token when my husband and i first married he was accustomed to a a greasy diet lots of fried foods and i nearly died then because i was accustomed to fresh vegetables and baked meats uh-huh huh or broiled meats or grilled meats i prefer my meat grilled to fried anytime i may do a little stir fry or a little wok or something like that but i do not fry my foods that much anymore used to but i don't anymore yeah two reasons one it's just not that healthy and it makes my stomach upset second it's a big mess to clean up i'm not interested in cleaning up a mess i'll say yeah it's been a couple years we got rid of our deep fryer we used to have one of those little bitty baby fryers and we'd uh do everything from uh uh-huh oh yeah uh fondues to some other little uh meats even the uh French bread we used to actually do in in uh French toast as it were in the oils but uh now it's just more like a grilled piece of uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh bread a a that's interesting i hadn't i hadn't really thought about the changes that have occurred i guess the whatever entity is moving us toward healthy foods is doing well the whole nation seems to be moving slowly that way uh-huh well of course now we're going to find out two years down the road that we've done something terrible and our body is going to  okay do you have any pets yes i've had i've had a number of them in my lifetime and i've i am a golden retriever fan but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry yes yes yeah oh instead of being carried yes well they were they really wanted something teeny tiny and i uh really wanted that retriever's disposition uh the ultimate to tolerant trainable disposition so i called yeah really four or five dog trainers because i don't like the little dogs and and i asked them you know these are the ages of the kids what do i get uh-huh and they all said golden retriever and i said okay put it under twenty pounds and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frise which is a do you know what that is huh yes i've seen those they're cute they're cute they look like an airheaded dog but let me tell you they're calm they're not yappy they're trainable they're uh very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is they're not dignified like a retriever can be yeah so how old is your retriever uh-huh oh she's about four she's not completely pure we got her from the uh Humane Society when she was a puppy she looks like a golden she looks just like a golden retriever but she's a little bit smaller she's like fifty five pounds well actually you know that's the breed standard for females what you yeah what you see shown and bred now as golden retrievers this you know plus eighty to a hundred pound range is it uh-huh that is not breed standard fifty five is the minimum but they usually run about sixty to sixty five and the ones that are shown huh they are inside that weight allowance you cannot show your retriever if it's you know a hundred plus pounds so don't say she's small just say she's perfect uh-huh oh huh yeah she's perfect well she's got a brown nose instead of black too uh-huh which makes her i guess unshowable even if she had papers which she doesn't but but we love her anyway she's just a lot of company to us we didn't yep we haven't had any kids and we're expecting a baby this summer but up until then she's been our substitute kid and she was a lot of fun well they are they are the ultimate dogs to have around kids so long as your kids not scared of a big dog because i had a retriever actually i had a retriever Irish setter cross right oh which is a really nice animal and fortunately it was just like a retriever and then i've had a retriever i bet it had a pretty coat too it was gorgeous it was just gorgeous i mean just gorgeous um and they both you know both the half breed and the pure breed had the um what i consider the the the perfect disposition but you know what you know what scares me about golden retrievers huh-uh since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders which is probably where yours came from people that don't know what they're doing and yeah they breed them you know for a certain characteristic and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big for somehow big is perceived as better and when you start doing that you really tamper with you know the all the the years of uh culling litters and and uh you tamper with what the dog innately is yeah we when i was when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like retriever you know the short to the ground stocky golden uh trainable tractable quiet animal that could hunt and still be in the house and i ended up getting one that uh came out of a a a hunting stock because i wanted one that could still perform like a retriever did right oh and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb dumb retrievers and i'm and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined yeah we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever and those dogs have been having seizures and i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of a breeding problem oh yeah you bet you you bet you you know how they came up with the retriever don't you the golden it was bred out of several different retrievers and they bred it for companionship and uh uh disposition and and ability to hunt it was kept only by kings huh-uh oh but they selectively culled those litters i mean for many hundreds of years and since it slept in the castle with its master i mean it had it had to be of a disposition to make it you know an animal you could keep around that closely but but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect now you know that seems like a cruel thing to do yeah on the other hand you sure you know they sure created a a wonderful breed i mean a wonderful breed yeah they did i i had never really had a golden retriever before we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds and all the other we looked at some of shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very uh social and stuff and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling and that was mine uh-huh well i tell you you know the the German shepherd is the classic case of what i'm talking about because in America that's called a Rin Tin Tin phenomena uh-huh only in America is there a dog called a German shepherd that dog is bred out of three European dogs the Belgian Tervurien a German schutzhund and oh really i always forget the third one i can see it uh but the third one is a children's dog and oh there are distinct breeds in Europe now what happened over here was is that people saw the the first um which would actually have been a schutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was uh-huh and everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin and it was known as a German shepherd here so they created a breed standard the American Kennel Club did that said anything that is a schutzhund a a Tervurien and uh Alsatian that's the other one Alsatian oh any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here and what happened is is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect and they bred a dog that huh i the it's called a an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you that German shepherd the American German shepherd here was a a a such an unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute refused to use them because they would turn on their on their handlers and uh-huh huh uh-huh even um uh police corps which started you know finding other breeds to use because this thing this this thing known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible so about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this so they went back to Europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds and bred uh-huh to a standard what they wanted an American German shepherd to be which is a very heavily now schutzhund and Alsatian and it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog it's just you see them in Europe and they're just lovely huh but you'll see i mean if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition AKC conforming huh which means that their advertising that this is no longer an indiscriminate dog this is bred for and they had to go through and destroy a for a while there about seventy five percent of their puppies that they bred wow because they were looking for this disposition and nowadays you you'll get you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific you know breeder handler they'll recommend their shepherds as a children's dog but huh  um fringe benefits are very important in the company in the company i think to provide the employee with a sense of security do you agree with that or oh absolutely uh are you talking about benefits i can't think of one more important then than the you know the medical yes at the rising cost of health uh care now it's uh if you have to go out and buy your company coverage you probably have to spend three four hundred dollars a month to get anything that even came close to it insurance right um-hum that's right and uh even have dental dental insurance now which is really good yeah so uh we uh we've just got dental insurance after the first of the year it's been i think probably oh about eight or nine years since we had dental coverage and it sure makes a difference and it it really does and uh uh well let's let's see insurance i i guess that would be one of the real biggies you know to a consideration yeah i think the in the insurance area one of the things that we also got that we didn't have before what we haven't had in about eight years is the card for prescriptions where you go in and just pay a minimal amount for prescriptions and uh we have some that are fairly expensive sixty seventy dollars well now we pay eight dollars for them but with um paying twenty percent uh no that's just all prescriptions uh i know well see if you had a seventy dollar yeah okay that would save you yeah and it's a i think it's five dollars on generic drugs and eight dollars on a name brand drug so no matter what they are in fact you have to pay the certain basic cost um-hum for them you don't have to meet any deductible or anything um-hum but uh how about paid time off uh yeah that's uh just vacation and some sick leave not very much though do uh do you have a certain number of sick leave to you know days that are available to you or or is it well pretty much just depends on your supervisor uh really depending uh on what you need kind of it's a case that there if you need more than a couple weeks or eight days or whatever it may be then they they will consider it um-hum so that's been with the companies i've been with generally at a a executive position they're a little more liberal even though they're not supposed to be supposed to treat everyone the same still leave hard you know rule more liberal with time off due to the all the extra hours executives put in yeah but uh the uh i think pension costs are making it more and more difficult for them to provide per pension benefits too it's uh oh that's right yes because it just keeps going an up up and up there too but uh there's yeah well do as you get closer to that time you start you know you start becoming yeah the older you get the more you start thinking about the possibilty pension all of a sudden you know i can remember when that who cares so now i think oh wait let's let's maybe we better start getting serious about that right right yeah yeah uh my son has worked for a company for about six year he graduated from college what in eighty six so five years this fall and he started out with they had a Four O One K plan and he asked me if he should get into it and i said well very small amount uh you can put in there and you keep adding to it and they're going to match it or so and um-hum all of a sudden at the end of last year he had a sizeable amount saved up in his Four O One K plan just with the matching funds that the company is putting in and any earnings on investments so but he can't touch that though right no no he can't but he's only uh twenty seven years old and he's already got a good start um-hum even if he changes companies he can you know roll that over into another plan um-hum um-hum yeah we had i had that too there's a certain percentage of your salary and the company matches it fifty percent not half not not half-and-half i meant yeah they don't match it exactly but fifty fifty percent which is good yeah um i wish i had a company that did that but there's oh there's various intangibles also like uh you know taking pride in the company you work for being able to say i work for such and such company or i hold such and such position with this company and that's one of the intangible fringe benefits i guess a certain ego level there your company has a lot of prestige well it not the one i'm working for now but one i did in the past did so but um-hum um-hum i i just felt you know at a i need to find a company like that again well another thing our company does is as far as uh like uh taking classes either within the company or them offering classes to us or yeah or or external you know they pay close pay yes pay tuition and books or a portion thereof and uh check they we i think we we have a mandatory we spend at least ten days a year not or not well yeah about something like that uh in taking classes and they're offered within TI but you we have training plans everybody does yeah so i mean they really you know i i think uh our company really has a lot of good really good benefits oh what you can find there is so many of these things like uh working for a company some of the things they really enhance your experience in case you do have to change companies oh really yeah i mean it's a just makes you that much more salable shall we say um-hum if you do have to go and search for another position um-hum that's true everything you everything you learn you its yours and you you it goes with you wherever you go so the more you learn the better off you are it's right that's right yeah yeah the company i used to be with also took care of things like professional dues and subscriptions to like the Wall Street and other professional man's magazines in the financial areas so it uh there are there are more than just insurance and pension there's lots of other things that come up um-hum back in the heyday of the economy before this recession then of course there were other things available to other people i never even took advantage of them of uh like memberships in clubs people that uh had to entertain and such um-hum so there's all sorts of fringe benefits that's true so salary salary is yeah salary is what we do work for and what we have to have that's our initial motivation eh that's right it it keeps your mortgage holder happy huh it keeps your mortgage holder happy that's right that's right yeah having to salary again being uh uh being able to acquire the the nicer things that you want not just have to live at a a certain level being able to do things or purchase things um-hum that you want that aren't really necessary um-hum so um that's about all i have well i guess that i guess we've pretty well exhausted that okay fine it's been nice talking with you well nice talking nice talking to you good-bye bye  okay well i take it since you selected this topic that you have children no i don't but i have nine younger brothers and sisters you don't my goodness so well i have two daughters and um they're past this they've been latchkey children for a while and they're almost where i can start saying they're you know young adults so i don't have to worry about child care too much anymore um-hum um we're supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask or expect uh-huh i would assume it's you know if you were looking for a day care center or something like that well if i were looking or probably even babysitters would be the same thing exactly exactly um i think my my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children yes i would think someone older and i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children um-hum um-hum and i think that varies i think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child yes that's true also um you know it's it's it's once they get to a certain age it's almost more important that it's someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone who's you know really really qualified per se uh-huh um but with a with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency um-hum so well um i did a lot of babysitting when i was younger i'm twenty two now and i did most of my babysitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen but um the only thing people ever asked me well of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids but they really didn't ask me if i was used to children or not the only other thing they asked me is what i would expect in pay oh uh-huh uh-huh you know and um i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone would you know i would want to know i personally would ask for people that that person has babysit for before well i my experience i babysit a lot also at when i grew up and um coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now i think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a a lot of times babysitters i know i did this with my children it's you get somebody where you kind of know the family already um-hum and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions um-hum because because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself so they they thought okay she knows how to how to treat children yes well see when um i first got my babysitting my first babysitting job was pretty strange um this lady saw us at church and she was a you you know she was a younger lady she didn't really know my mom she knew my mom by name and that was it and um she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family so she just asked my mom if i could babysit uh-huh uh-huh you know she really didn't know my name or anything you know and i thought that was pretty strange you know and she had two children one was still in diapers when i started babysitting wow so um she pretty much you know just assumed that i would know you know how to handle them so i want you know i enjoy kids and i get along with them very well so there's no problem but uh with today's world and the kids today uh there's no way i can't say that i would just ask someone you know that i didn't know like that to babysit oh i agree with you but there again she she you know she knew knew of your family and she and she met in a safe setting such as church um-hum that's true um-hum so she was going on those two instincts just the same i know myself i never and i was very very protective on who babysit my children oh i would be too and and in it it really shocked me because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell she had just moved in the neighborhood she had her daughter with her and the daughter was oh about a second grader and she was actively looking for people who would babysit her child oh my and i thought well she doesn't know me or my children from anything and huh-uh it was i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because i didn't know her then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house um-hum yes uh-huh so i mean people are so different oh i know um well i really i obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything well i did i did have um my my child uh in a day care for just a short time and when my oldest was about two and a half and i worked just a part-time job and uh-huh uh in in those situations um what i did is i'd i went in and you know i made a few phone calls i went in and visited i asked questions such as how they would discipline a child um that was a concern with me um you know uh-huh you you learn a lot by going in there and they explain they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um that's you know that's as much as i know you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers um-hum you know that have done this over and over again but i well go ahead how did you stumble upon the day care center did you just look it up in a phone book or what was it um i think lots of people lot i think i went by location for one thing i think most people do that i think you start out with the criteria of um-hum you know do i know of anything or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care and yeah most i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth right right and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it you know i mean you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north uh-huh yes exactly you even if that's the best one in the whole wide world um-hum so there there are just so many considerations um-hum then again did um money come into play with it at all oh money is always a factor in my life definitely i've never you know i've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor um even in something as important as day care i know if i didn't have that stipulation i would have done things differently uh-huh you know um Montessori school would be something that i would have pursued but that's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at uh-huh um and i was very very fortunate in that i didn't have to do that on a full-time basis yes so and and then when you get you know when you get into the full-time basis day care  okay okay um well what's your favorite TV program well i tape one soap opera everyday and i watch that i've been watching that since i was in college i mean we made our class schedules around it so we could watch Days of Our Lives and then um uh-huh pretty much i like the thirty minute sitcoms in the evenings i mean i don't i don't get to watch them a lot but i do watch Murphy Brown and Designing Women hm so what do you watch uh well to the to the great chagrin of my husband i i love all forms of entertainment and so i i watch Entertainment Tonight with regularity oh yeah i love it but it comes on so late i tape it and watch it the next day yes oh you do well that's a good idea yeah because i was real disappointed because on Sundays i used to especially try to watch it and because they kind of caught you up during the week and uh then they put on some other goofy show after that right well that they're doing it Saturday nights now um-hum oh really what at the at ten thirty oh well i'll have to watch that then ten thirty hm for an hour i mean yeah i'm sure my husband doesn't care too much for that either no i just what can i say i just matter of taste and the the rest of the time right now there's not a TV series that i'm particularly yeah glued to uh i watch some of the anthologies if they've got something interesting on like Masterpiece Theatre or yeah Mystery or something like that yeah oh really yeah um channel thirteen had on a a thing about astronomy that was really neat but i didn't get to see all the parts yes we saw we saw we saw several of those not all of them huh and uh so we're we're we're pretty eclectic watchers we've i've been introduced to the joys of Star Trek so we watch that with with total total devotion the old ones or the new ones do you watch the new ones too uh yes only the new one i i i i never really was interested in the old one and uh and so but i like i like the cast of the new one so uh that's what we watch oh yeah well that's pretty neat yeah i don't even know when that comes on anymore uh Saturdays oh really hm well we go to the lake a lot so when i don't get to see it that much TV in the summertime and plus everything is in reruns anyway so i guess it works out um-hum true that's true um i i'm a very selective watcher i i look at the TV section and decide what i'm going to watch and watch it but as a rule i don't sort of stroll around the dial and yeah yeah without with the old remote control in hand let things catch my eye yes unlike certain parties yeah i've got my niece and nephew coming this summer so i thought well i ought to get the Disney channel because there's some fun stuff on there even for me to watch oh yes oh yes and also i don't know how old they are but there's Nickelodeon oh yeah i love Nickelodeon but they get that but where they live they live out in the boondocks of Oklahoma and they don't get the Disney channel oh well they would enjoy that so yeah i think i might have to do that but i mean just some of the movies that they have on there i would love to see so i might have to do that um-hum so would i i wouldn't admit it to anybody normally yeah i like the older movies better i think uh channel twenty one or somebody played uh Hello Dolly last night oh well yes you hit upon a a weak spot of mine i like i i have a thing for the actor who played Cornelius Hackel yes oh really yeah it was neat no i mean forty here twenty years later you understand yes because he's uh he plays the Phantom of the Opera now and oh i didn't realize that oh yes and his voice is somewhat developed to put it mildly and so uh but but i've already got that on tape so we didn't tape it yeah yeah i like old movies i love musicals oh i do too i mean i've got um High Society on tape that i taped and uh you know all the older ones um-hum um-hum right they were fun to watch they were real good on rainy days and there's nothing else on oh i know sit back and watch the old musicals i know i keep a little a little a little library and if i get stuck i can resort to my little library in all sorts of things oh yeah yeah because that does happen a lot there is nothing on anywhere on cable or anything it's surprising with all the choice we have sometimes there's no choice yeah it's strange well um did i catch you in the middle of something not really but uh you know luckily i wasn't i hadn't i hadn't started dinner yet oh yeah i've i've already finished mine i haven't done my dishes yet my husband's on his way home so well i do we have a time limit hm i don't know i got kicked off the other day because they said the lines were busy hm but i think i uh i don't i think that's unusual i don't think that's typical yeah hm well i've enjoyed talking to you me too me too and uh you keep you keep on watching for those old movies oh i will got to tape them thanks bye all right all right bye-bye  all right so uh you live in Dallas yes i live in Dallas now i understand that um the the real estate market out there has really gone crazy up and down up and down yeah i think right now it's it's kind of bad uh i don't live in a house i live in an apartment oh are are you in a house okay yeah uh-huh yeah we have a single family home in northern Virginia just outside of Washington well i guess the best i can do is is uh compare apartments if i can compare the one that i have now with the one that i had the last time the one that i have now uh has a lot more amenities i guess is the right word than the one that i moved out of uh this one you know gave us free cable and uh ceiling fans and uh it was practically new when i moved in here and the carpet was new and huh do you live in the high-rise no it's not a high-rise it's just a a two story building uh-huh uh but there's you know there there are a lot of buildings but it's just two stories uh on the second floor they have they don't have a patio but they have a sunroom instead of the patio on the first floor um where i am there's a patio oh okay so so you just you have one floor all to yourself oh okay yeah the rooms are nice and large and let's see i have i have two bedrooms and uh oh that's nice do you get your own washer dryer well i i i have a washer and dryer area and i i did buy the washer and dryer but they didn't provide it the one that i moved from didn't didn't have a place to put put them and that's one of the reasons that i did move oh yeah that is nice yeah get tired of dragging clothes to the Laundromat yeah so tell me about yeah i've always uh been pretty lucky the real estate out here's been pretty good its uh the the prices of well the prices came down last year we've we had sort of like a Dallas syndrome the past uh yeah uh year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern Virginia it just never happened before so it's really surprising everybody all the developers don't know what to do uh-huh just it's real good yeah it's a good time to buy if you're in the market yeah unfortunately we're uh we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids and we have a three bedroom house and it's pretty much filled up right now um-hum oh so you want a bigger one yeah um-hum get an extra bedroom or a basement right now it's just a a single level rambler uh-huh one thing about the houses in uh in Dallas they don't uh utilize basements the way they did in New York my parents in New York had uh a uh three family house uh-huh actual actually it was a two family house where the the um the downstairs and the second floor they had and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment oh and uh they had a basement and they you know they finished the basement and they were able to rent that out also but uh in Dallas i i just i i just haven't seen basements in houses yeah yeah and i've looked at a lot of them yeah a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there and that's what he said was that you know it just wasn't something that people had down there they put pools and garages on but uh no basements no it's not right i haven't i haven't i have yet to see a basement in a house hum maybe it's all the sand is there a lot of sand in i always think it's like a desert i don't know when i think of Dallas always well no no no no you know i don't see that kind of sand here um there are some areas though where where they have a problem with uh the houses kind of sinking a little bit into the uh-huh to the uh or the foundation sinking or something you know just a just a little bit some more than others but you you have to know the right spot to to pick where that doesn't happen and uh yeah well out here we um we live in what used to be uh like a prairie or whatever a natural you know natural grasslands and uh they it's just you go down four inches and you get to sandstone well fourteen inches you get to sandstone uh-huh yeah and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast it's just solid sandstone i see huh where did you say you're at Colorado no Virginia yeah it's sort of unusual really most of Virginia is clay Virginia Virginia that's right uh-huh anywhere near uh Virginia Beach huh oh yeah uh-huh yeah my uh my folks used to live there back before i was born they lived there oh uh-huh well different areas in Dallas have different kind in uh in Texas i'll say because down in east Texas there's a lot of red clay and um uh-huh in the in the Dallas you know Fort Worth city areas you don't see that yeah well uh Texas is a big state so i imagine the the type of houses and uh things like that are truly different from area to area but uh yeah yeah well that's the same way out here because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds Washington uh-huh and anything inside that beltway the highway the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive yeah so you know you really can't afford i i i could never afford a house inside the beltway that's why we came out here this is called the the the country you know with only you know maybe twenty miles total from DC twenty five oh from the city but um it's considered the country since it's uh you know that far out but um yeah we live out by Dulles Airport well i see yeah and uh that's one of the few places still in northern Virginia they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here and you know it's it's still pretty rural um-hum uh not too much of northern Virginia is like that anymore land has gotten so expensive they just can't afford to have low income housing like that so is your house in an area by itself i mean no we're in a development there's uh yeah there's another one half an acre away or a quarter acre away rather not connected to another one oh but it's not they're not connected are they uh-huh oh no huh-uh yeah its uh a stand alone single family home i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up yeah uh my folks um had an apartment for a while when we were kids but um for the most part i they they always had you know and Pennsylvania always had a single family home and so uh-huh you know as soon as we could we we got a single family home and that's all i ever knew growing up so i stayed in a townhouse for uh two years and then uh saved up enough money to to get a uh-huh  hello hello hi um this is Betty and i'm in Richardson Texas i'm Nola and i'm in Plano oh okay well here we go i guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that are that did some stuff over in the Gulf um yeah no did you push one oh okay okay well then i think it i just started doing this so i don't know too much about it yeah uh no i haven't pushed one yet i just oh okay we're just sort of getting acquainted here oh okay um you know i i just wanted to see if you know you had an opinion about this or you know uh-huh um so if that's okay with you then i'll just press one okay that'll be fine well hi good morning hi i think i mean if if i start this i just wanted to say that um one of the things that i don't think we really understood about the the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are and i mean they think differently and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours and and right now i i think that that's been proven in the fact that um they have just well anyway i just think that you know the United States policy over there i think we should just leave them alone i really do in in a major way because they just um that whole region over there i think needs to settle it's own differences within itself yeah and that's the way the course that they should go i mean you know we can maybe help them a little bit prompt them but i don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on the the thing with Israel and Palestine i believe that should be settled between them and also um you know the other thing is their idea or our idea idea of democracy has nothing to do with them i mean that i mean i'm talking about the whole middle eastern and and maybe this is too general but i just believe that um they do not look at democracy the same way we do they don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live yeah and so you know trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just you know it i don't think that that's the way to go in this and um you know it it oh well that's that's a couple thoughts on it i i guess you know i'd like you to maybe express something here yeah well i i i think overall that's right i think it's kind of sad though that for generations they've been taught to hate each other yeah and that's if you know if somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way that's yeah you know and an i i think that um true we do have completely different ways of looking at things at a lot of things but uh at the same time i think there are a lot of there is a lot of good that the United States and other countries can do as far as example and and um i think some different things could come from what's happened than what we expect well yeah well yeah um i i guess we could be a catalyst for their change i um the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there and i don't think we'd be talking about this you know the Israeli situation Palestinian situation um sort of came to a head um unless there had been a war i mean that was yeah one thing that came out of it good or bad i i don't judge any war as good or bad it's just a war and i don't see any winners or losers i just see dead bodies i'm sorry you know but um yeah i i i just think you know you're right and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along it's not going to be that we're going to uh you know sort of tell them to go to their room and that's going to solve the whole problem it's going to be them yeah but that's the type of thing they understand they don't understand any other way and so at that at that you have to work at their level to an extent too yeah and you know it's yeah that that's true too i um uh they wouldn't have understood anything else than what we did in the war there was nothing else yeah oh well yeah they they understand violence they love violent leaders to you know i mean look at you know the leader they had they they just adored him because he was so strict and cruel and you know for a while there he had them yeah i can't figure out why they adored him well it has a lot to do with their religion i got to say that over there um and i know this yes yeah only because from personal experience that i'm speaking of this because i've i've you know traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i've done that and one one of the kindest people i've ever met in my whole life um is from that area of the country and i mean he is just overly he he is abounding in kindness let's say and his life is so Godly i mean every thought they have a totally different life than we have yeah hum you know and when you add the um commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them and they have very basic life um yeah well it's just a very basic life and they just really believe in Allah or God or whatever and it's you know everything is to the glory of Allah and and you know and it it's almost like um-hum what's sad is that the leaders that have control yeah well that's see are in that using that yeah power yes and they abuse that and it's always been military and it's always been and that's that's always been the way of the world don't you think which i think that that's not the the way the majority of the people over there really are yeah so it's really hard when you see the leaders compared to the people but i think in a in a way the war uh i think in a way all uh the involvement over there too though has shown a lot of people that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing and there are a lot of people who are good people yeah yeah you know there's and i i think we may not have ever have seen that without some of these uh newspeople being in there in the broadcasts and the the uh soldiers leaving um you know surrendering and trying to get out of that situation and and the um uh you know right and surrendering that was yeah it just really comes down to people are people you know you have to have some compassion some humanness doesn't matter where the boundaries are that's right um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages and and i i think so much of it is what you're taught yeah that's true you know they teach their children uh in such a way that  all right what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool and it's uh it's just really pretty easy it's pretty much dumping things in and stirring and i like that uh-huh uh the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it and then i you're supposed to do chicken but i just use those little cans of chicken uh-huh and it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but i get my kids to do that so i i don't have to do that oh and um and it really and you mix it all up with yeah there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but it's so simple and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime uh-huh oh yeah you serve it cold oh yeah that sounds good yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but but it's really good hum and i like that one yeah usually when we entertain we do something really simple because i like to visit with my company and not be scurrying around in the kitchen so a lot of times we'll barbecue like that for Memorial Day we had some friends over and we yeah exactly just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolph's Meat Marinate and put it on the smoker and uh-huh oh that sounds good cooked it and that it was real good you can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way and then people think they're eating steak or something yeah yeah and these days that helps doesn't it yeah yeah yeah it really does i know what you mean i don't usually i just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it now spaghetti's such an easy one um i do that a lot uh-huh i do spaghetti a lot yeah it seems like most people like spaghetti yeah i don't like to do that if if it's hot real hot though yeah because um i don't know i have a real thing about being hot in the in the summertime i guess uh-huh well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference yeah in your whole house yeah i think that's right and um we don't entertain that often but when we do i'm like you i like it to be fast and easy and something so that we can talk and not uh-huh yeah and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time most we don't entertain like people from work or stuff even often usually friends from church and stuff and it's usually kind of like yeah you want to come over and they say well what can we bring and so it's real easy because you just make one or two things and everybody else brings something yeah that's exactly like us from our church we just do it yeah oh yeah yeah it's a lot more relaxing i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to make you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone oh well you see all that on TV and i could never be that person huh-uh it just uh i'm just not well i'm so i'm pretty laid back yeah and uh and so i don't i know a lady in a my church and uh she like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she um does food she really goes all out and i don't know how she can do it and be calm yeah yeah do you work i guess no i don't do you stay home with kids uh-hum yeah yeah i i've been working we're going to have a baby this summer and i'm not going to work anymore yeah so hopefully i think i'll enjoy cooking more when i don't have to work all day i don't like to come home and oh how exciting stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night so yeah well i usually start about six and an and cook and and then eat at seven i mean cook cook at five and eat at six rather uh-huh eat at six yeah yeah and uh my family and i we're a sit down together family oh that's good uh yeah i don't like the run in and out part and yeah i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and and my husband about what's happened and yeah that's neat i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home and uh uh-huh you know we could learn to talk about things and i think that's good yeah that really is it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other yeah i think right now we eat in front of the TV but since it's just the two of us it's yeah yeah well that happens to us sometimes too uh yeah sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door uh-huh see what's happening yeah anyway food is is uh a real lifestyle kind of thing and i some people don't like to do this but i like to cook uh cook with my kids oh uh-huh and if they're going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i don't i don't know if you've ever made them maybe not since you don't have kids yet but those JELL-O uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i can't think of what they call it oh i've seen those in the magazines yeah they're so simple uh-huh and the kids love to do that uh finger food is is a biggie with them and yeah and like now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so yeah that's uh they like to eat it but it's a hard one to have to to prepare yeah i'll bet but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that so yeah oh yeah yeah we like that that's good that that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too yeah my son's getting to be a a real good cook so uh oh neat sometimes he fixes me breakfast oh wow that's great yeah i like it i like it a lot how old he he's eleven eleven wow that's good uh-huh yeah so he's do you cook breakfast like you cook a breakfast every morning or uh not every morning uh mostly during the summer it's hit and miss and we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that um during the summer during yeah yeah wintertime when they're in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when it's really cold i even cook oatmeal because i like oatmeal and the look they like it all right and um uh-huh yeah then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because they're on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but oh uh-huh yeah yeah so i try to uh and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that i used to do them in the microwave but they don't like that oh do they get rubbery or uh um i've never tried it it depends it depends if you let them cook too long uh-huh then they'll turn a little bit gray you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i don't like that yeah so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up oh uh-huh huh yeah an and that turns out okay and it's funny because if i turn them out on to a dish i on to like a plate for them to take what they want yeah uh-huh they don't know i've ever done it in a microwave it's really funny it's very deceiving you know because if they see it with their eyes they go uh i don't like want that yeah you know and yet if they don't ever see it then then it's like oh this tastes okay you know so anyway yeah we had my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash everybody would say we don't like squash we won't eat squash so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there you know and then we'd go oh this is really good yeah  are you ready to start okay yes have you recently bought a new car Catherine well i just found out that my car was thirty months old and it doesn't seem like it's that old seems like i just bought it oh oh wow it's an eighty nine and i bought it uh in uh eighty eight so yeah well i really i the last car we got was a was a used car i really don't prefer buying a new car i like to let somebody else pay for that i know i really will do that the next time i buy it too but uh mine was a year old and we bought it for very functional purposes and that was we bought a station wagon we wanted an economical car um-hum um-hum um-hum to operate but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment so we chose a Nissan Stanza wagon and i've never been sorry however the need for that um-hum oh that's wonderful um-hum kind of car has changed now oh okay and uh while it is still good and it's quite serviceable and i'll drive it until it no longer is reliable and probably then some i spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up um um sure i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted right i would either buy a Nissan Maxima uh i'm sold on Nissans i or or or foreign cars actually uh uh-huh but you feel though uh craftsmanship is much superior to the American abilities uh is that how you i have never its reliability it's reliability its and uh i you know i've read all the Consumer Reports and things and they just run head and shoulders above the American made cars if Ford was a head and the shoulders above it i'd buy a Ford isn't that a shame but i had uh had a Ford Escort that absolutely needed taps the day we got it my word isn't that sorry that's sorry uh you know i mean it was ready for the graveyard and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car my word oh mercy so and that was just trying to hold us getting out of that was a used car and it was an older car but you know Escort is supposed to have a great track record you'd um um hm hum as far as sales um-hum but it's just it just was not and you get stung a time or two and you say no thanks so i just trusted the Consumer Reports and the auto sure no thanks that's right um-hum um-hum uh reports instead had my son who knows a lot about that study them thoroughly and he gave me four choices of cars to buy an Escort definitely was not among them in fact there wasn't an American car in there uh-huh wow uh the Nissan came and and we bought the Nissan for functional purposes not what the Consumer Reports said we should get um-hum but it served our needs uh later on his reports the reports that he studied showed that uh Nissan was head and shoulders above the rest in the area in the class that we were looking for and that and i'd rather have a Maxima than a Cadillac i really would it's not necessarily prestige but it's comfort uh there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car uh uh-huh who makes that car Nissan Maxima i mean but where are they where are they what what is their location is it uh Asian or is it European or who no no no Nissan Japanese oh it is Japanese okay i didn't know um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah and if i couldn't have my luxury Maxima uh-huh then i'd buy me a fancy little red CRX sports car okay i mean you know every other every one of us have two sides yeah i guess so that's true yeah yeah now what about you if you could have the car that you wanted what would you get and why if if if i had the car i wanted gee probably um uh-hum uh let's see i like the looks of the Lincoln Town Car but i i don't know the performance of it that's a Ford product and you know i would get hung up by my boot straps if i ever if i ever mentioned the Ford product in my family uh-huh uh-huh yeah see there uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um-hum i'll tell you that's sad too because at one time Ford was the best that was made yeah yeah really was um-hum and uh i i really have not seen now a lot of the American cars actually are are parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa can i put you on hold for one minute thank you of course well that was one minute they hung up okay huh uh uh at any rate do you have color preferences or what would be the features that you'd be looking for um well the comfort of a large car the the security of a large car um-hum uh and the luxuries of a large car um-hum uh now color preferences i think i would opt to go with a bronze uh-huh uh-huh which is probably closest to gold that you can get yeah oh wow we like the stuff that glitters good there's nothing wrong with that actually i think probably if i were going to get uh if i were going to be practical which doesn't mean i would be i would prefer white right well practically yes that's uh-huh because simply because it's more visible at night right and it's cooler i believe too when you're driving in and uh-huh um-hum now the interior okay i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red uh-huh uh-huh but if i had the little read CRX i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the CRX it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too ah i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind um can you uh hang on again um-hum thanks i've got the phones for lunch hour um-hum so just don't mind me if i bounce back and forth that's okay um so you like to listen to uh a lot of music or do is it talk shows no no no i generally would prefer uh prefer to listen to uh well i listen to KCBI a lot but i will listen to the news and the and the traffic and those things at work uh-huh um-hum but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time i want some real good classical music i love classical music and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the um-hum um-hum all the yeah um-hum all the characteristics of the instruments um-hum that's true so i do love classical music or at least or or uh contemporary classical do you listen to do you like listen to WRR uh-huh sure do WRR and the Oasis are the two that i listen to more than anything else and i do like them and uh yeah um-hum um-hum i'd like to have a compact disk player in a car that would be something that i would really like those compact disks really are good for cars because they don't melt they don't warp you know there's nothing in there that can wrap around the the uh those are nice aren't they yes those are nice um-hum um-hum rollers or anything it seems seems like a really good answer to portable music that you can choose  uh national health insurance i think is a problem in as much as the quality of health care that people will receive right yeah because uh the articles that i've read regarding national health service in Canada and England has indicated that uh what stay stay in line for uh four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor right yeah i'm i'm sort of mixed on this i think that the the answer may lie in uh not in so much a uh national kind of medical thing that like like England has but more of a um national insurance uh sort of clearinghouse or whatever i think that uh too many the problem with with right now is that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through and and i think that i think you you mentioned Canada i think that they have a system where uh they the government deals with the with i mean you you go to whoever you want but file through one one's particular uh setup and that way um i see they they are able to reduce prices because they've you know it's it's all one one centralized thing yeah like i think that uh again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own if you don't have a company supporting you in the uh picking up the major portion of your health insurance the cost is um-hum almost prohibitive right uh i i was listening uh on the radio the other day and they were talking something something something like this i think they were talking about the fact that um the money that could be saved um in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider um could uh could they could make they could it i i provide health insurance to to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save yeah uh we're currently where i'm working now under Blue Cross i don't know what the total cost of the program is but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a a month or something like that so i assume that probably the total coverage cost is probably three fifty to four hundred they're probably picking up about half of it and that's a pretty good policy right right but if you had something like one of these uh health maintenance programs or one of whatever the type name is HMO uh where the yeah HMO uh where you go to the doctor and it only costs you ten dollars and the insurance picks up the rest if you tried to buy something like that i'm probable it would probably be five or six hundred dollars a month yeah is they're they're fairly expensive i i um for just the cost of something i had was on an HMO up until last year and uh through through work and it was yeah i forget how much i paid a month but it was much you know is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care yeah and uh the reason i i quite was because of uh not because i didn't like it i i really kind of did uh the reason i quite was just because the the doctor a a certain doctor that we enjoyed enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that HMO so we my wife decided she wanted to to stay with that doctor so we went to the to the yeah the medical insurance that we have at here at work and uh i uh yeah i like the i like the convenience of the HMO in in a certain respect because it uh even though you're once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem you know a lot of people complain saying well i don't want to uh be have to be told who i need to go to but you know if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference yeah that's right because you can you know if if you find someone you really like and then we did find several good doctors and um like you say it's uh five dollars an office visit and um my wife was in the hospital had our had our daughter and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars oh goodness for everything uh that included uh you know the doctors the time the hospital everything delivery room and everything delivery room and everything include including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay but that was that was still included in that price that cost so it's really nice because they yeah you know their their attitude is different than than a regular uh insurance uh health insurance uh the in in a HMO you know they're trying to prevent a problem by by keeping the cost down at the front end yeah you know and have you come in you know they they charge five dollars a yeah you know pop you're more willing to go in and try to take care of a problem before it grows big yeah as to a company's benefit to have a program like that because it keeps their employees healthy and on the job yeah because they don't have to worry about going in and and paying uh seventy five dollars to have the doctor look at you for ten minutes right yeah i i uh i i really liked it we both my wife and i both did you you don't have to worry about filling out forms uh you know for reimbursement and all or you know getting paid eight percent of of whatever you just pay the the five dollars right then and then you're done with it yeah but here again the the doctor's practices in hospitals have gone become fairly sizeable businesses under themselves now uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself you have to pay your share of the operating of that um-hum eight story building uh when the rooms are empty so they spread the costs out over uh all the patient costs and uh that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that right right the horror stories that you hear about people going into the hospital for a week and uh it being a four thousand dollar bill well they and then again they're also they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay you know they they get a lot of uh right a lot of uh people who are just just have to be there and can't afford it and so they they know they're not going to get paid you know get money from them so they yeah yeah will have to absorb it somewhere else yeah my daughter and son-in-law had a baby here about uh what he he'll be three in August and uh their insurance plan that they're under um-hum encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital right and like she went in she had the baby and she was out in two days time right and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital the deductibles didn't apply right rig ht and so that's one way one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by uh okay if you'll shorten your stay then we will uh waive the deductible right our our insurance is uh is doing something similar where they're also going to more  do you have any i'm trying to think off hand i can't think of anything you know i have i have one it's it's and it's a real pet peeve of mine it seems i i do work during the day and when i'm home uh you know i'm either cooking or running doing things or uh laundry or stuff and i hate when the phone rings okay uh-huh and it turns out to be a telephone salesman oh and it's real two there're two pet peeves about it number one i really feel that that's my private you know my own home uh-huh and i hate and if i want something i will get it i will go out and get it myself and i will never i never buy anything from a telephone salesperson um-hum oh i wouldn't either no so i really feel that it is a real invasion they're invading my time and my space by uh you know interfering in whatever i'm doing for and i it really bothers me uh-huh uh-huh um it's a little bit like junk mail but except you can't you know ignore it uh quite as easily and i i try to be polite but at the same point yeah that doesn't always work well i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested and then i hang up before they can say anything oh really yes and it works very well because you don't hear you don't have they can say anything they want it's just but i just feel that's my big thing on the invasion of my thing on invasion of privacy oh oh um-hum and um i have i sort of have a thought like you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists i wish that there were a way that you could um get your telephone you know submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things from a business um-hum well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list uh you you you you do that by uh um the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send it's for every company i mean you can't do it for any company uh-huh you know but you can then send it and they can prove they tell that company's not allowed to sent it you any junk mail if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can oh really oh i didn't even know that yeah yeah you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out to not to get you know junk mail from specific companies oh wow and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company and you could say that uh have your name your number put in a registry and then anyone making these calls has to check that registry for that area yeah um-hum and could not should and is not allowed under penalty of you know being reported or something to call you yeah so that would be one way of doing it i can't really think of anything that invades my privacy but one of my pet peeves you came up with the telephone is when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message um-hum i can't stand that i think that is so stupid you know because oh i'm guilty of that sometimes because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message and i and i wasn't going to be available to be called back uh-huh and it was sort of like oh the hell i'm not going to spend the time giving and leaving a message and uh i'll call later if i'm available the other thing that um that there is recourse to and that's another thing is yeah when you you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number uh-huh well legally legally now they're not allowed they're not you do not have to give a telephone number oh really yes and i don't really like announcing in public uh-huh you know when you're sitting there my telephone and i don't like the the the way telephone numbers can be used we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number but it turned out it had to been my husband's office phone number um-hum and uh we were able we weren't actually able to trace it but we were able to to discard the charges um but it was um-hum i don't like how they ask the i i realize that this is your identification but i worked with someone that got hold of his charge cards and his social security number um-hum um-hum yeah same with my husband it was a charge card and social security number and you know i don't i don't like i don't get ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security number out well you should never give the social security number uh if sometimes if you charge sometimes i charge theater tickets um-hum over the phone and then you know because they pick them up at the box office will call but um that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone and that was because i initiated it yes uh and occasionally i do order things from catalogs um-hum over the phone but again it's i initiate it not the company the other thing is though you do not have to if you're buying something in a store and they ask and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number you do not have to give it that is one that's a law that went into effect i don't know a year or two ago oh i never even knew that and uh you can just say i'm sorry that you uh i'm not required to give that by law and then they won't uh a lot of stores will still ask um-hum but uh the credit card company you know accepts the charges i mean it's a responsibility the credit cards company uh company's responsibility um-hum well is there any like pet peeves that you have that don't necessarily invade your privacy so what and this um well this it would this is limited to the privacy issue the invasion of privacy oh okay yeah and i guess uh that was my that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy for people outside the family of course i've got little pet peeves you know with my family you you know but of course that that i guess that just comes with the uh with the territory with a family that does a mother you lose some privacy i really can't think of any that would invade my privacy but uh um-hum nothing that you felt that you know any experiences you've had at work you know hm no i you know other i i really can't say anything that would really bother me so many things i think over the years have been um accepted i mean when you uh that are no longer done um-hum i mean i can remember when i was very young much younger and i applied for a job they said well don't aren't you planning to have children well i mean that's none of their business yeah and but of course now by law they can't ask that yeah so i mean there has been i think a lot to done to protect privacy yeah especially between women and you know like age and all that stuff how do you feel you know with sex you know your sex with you know um-hum they've they've gotten a lot with uh applications and stuff and they're not allowed to ask yeah that's right do you feel that drug testing is an invasion of privacy no because i think it's for the better of like it you mean like for working and stuff or AIDS testing yeah um-hum no i don't because i think whenever and something like that they're looking out for everyone they're not you know i think it's more safety than anything else yeah i feel that way too i sometimes feel that you know sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit yeah because i know you know for example airline pilots i mean i do want my pilot to be sober yeah because i know i worked at a still mill in this summer and i know that um i've covered for people that came in drunk you know on the late shift or something uh-huh yeah yeah and it and it's dangerous i don't even like having them around i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them you know that's right yeah i know i yeah i feel you know i think some of the people that oppose you know mandatory drug testing for certain areas say well it's not  okay well i worked out today well i didn't you didn't do you do you ever yeah yeah i end up being um a lot we're fixing to go on vacation so i'm running here and there and everywhere and oh yeah well that's a workout in itself getting ready to go huh yeah it the the recorder came on i went oh boy do how do i miss today because i thought if i'd be there right now i couldn't have taken this call so my guilt feelings come rushing through but yeah do you go every day uh usually yeah i try to um go to i have a membership at Fitness Fitness and Figure World here yeah oh really um-hum is that is that male and female yeah yeah mine is just female i'm too big of a wimp to go to the male and female well it's it's it's kind of like oh your split-level house its got the male stuff on one side oh really uh and then it has a Nautilus equipment that male or female can use and then it's got your aerobics room which is coed and then it's got the female side which has all their Nautilus that they can use by theirselves and their own sauna yeah do a lot of the guys do the aerobics uh no not most of them most it's mostly female just mostly female have they been have you done the bench bench aerobics yet oh yeah the steps do you like it i'm still not sure about it yet yeah i've a um i yeah i'm too busy concentrating if i'm going to twist my ankles or something yeah fall off the bench yeah because i have broken both my ankles so i'm real leery about oh no you know yeah well i i read an article that it's really not that good on your knees stepping and looking and well i didn't i don't know how it could be yeah um so i haven't i haven't ventured with that yet i'm i'm thinking it may be just a fad and will pass with everything else yeah but in our classes there's a ton of people that do it oh yeah and they do it i think they only have it like three times a week because i think that's what they pretty much recommend but still uh i think that would be so hard on your knees yeah um so and you know the boxes get pretty tall and i um yeah i don't know i haven't got to the tallest one yet and it hasn't the i did uh when i first started it bothered my knees behind my knees huh that's strange that's the only place i was sore and i thought well i must not be doing them right or or something because that i have no need for that muscle back there yeah really i can't ever think of when you would use that huh so so i'm you know i can see where it because it effected my knees wow and i did regular aerobics like last night with without the boxes and i got more of a workout uh-huh yeah and it was a no bounce class yeah oh really and i still got more of a workout as far as in you know stamina etcetera huh well i was a cheerleader for a long long time so i don't get into the aerobics at all because it's too much like cheerleading so i mostly just ride the bike and do the weights on the machines yeah but i do they have aquacise which i like that quite a bit Now i've been to that i haven't been to that yet uh i've i've it just it just doesn't move fast enough for me i don't think yeah well i mean you know it varies from instructor to instructor but if you get a good one you can get a pretty good workout yeah i've got to have something hyper really i've never tried it so i guess i've i ought to try it before i think it's not fast enough well yeah you'd think with broken ankles that would be a good way to go because you don't get that friction when you land yeah yeah huh well i've never i guess i ought to try i don't know it just never appealed to me as much as as yeah as uh just for real hard aerobics does for some reason and and then the weights and i'm really and and then the weights and i'm really um like in the the step machines yeah oh yeah that's great do you is it a Stairmaster uh i'm not sure what it is because see the one that we have isn't Stairmaster so it's not quite as good i don't think but um it's it's real good for you but boy they say that you're supposed to go twenty minutes and i can't do that no i've been trying to work up to it but i can't oh when they first started me i had a girl who was training me and she'd only been there three weeks and she says well you just push this button and you turn the dial and you just go and i'm like one side would go down and then the other side and i thought i and these guys on each side of me are just pumping it like you know and i'm going there's got to be something wrong here and the guy looks over and says he's got you started on ten oh no so let's turn it down and then i was keeping up with him you know but it was funny because i thought i am like in slow motion compared to everybody around me what i and i felt like way out of shape and it just happened to be the dial was wrong but yeah you mostly go the evenings yes yeah yeah i attempted going in the mornings and it was really good because then it was out of the way and you know and nothing interfered but it's just so much harder to get up that much earlier yeah i am more i used to do i used to run in the mornings oh i hate running and in i'm just much more stretched out by the evening yeah from work and everything because i was really having uh backaches and stuff when i'd get halfway through the day i couldn't figure out why yeah i hadn't thought about that yeah huh i hadn't thought about that well my other problem was i'd get to the club and i'd be getting ready to go to work and i'd realize i didn't have my blouse or something oh yeah so that was always kind of traumatic yeah it could be of course i don't know it could be great for business yeah i wonder i did i literally went in one day in my linen skirt and a sweatshirt oh my gosh so so anyway well enjoy your vacation well i'm looking forward to it where you going uh we're going to San Diego oh that will be fun yeah i have family that lives out there so oh well have a good time i'm sure you'll look fine in your bathing suit well thanks yeah oh we have a lake party this weekend so i'm really kind of going ugh oh really yeah but well it was for one thing i haven't we've we've been in the water a lot we have a boat and we skied a lot but i just haven't brought myself to ski yet this year so maybe maybe this weekend yeah i've i've yeah if it's good we've we've been out a couple times and gotten into the swing of it so we're we're ready we go to lake we stay here ski here Lake Beltin which lake do you go to oh huh well i'm is it a big one yeah we might have to check that out sometime well okay have a good vacation talk to you later bye-bye yeah okay thanks bye  okay what are your favorite things to watch oh um let's see i uh i have enjoyed uh Thirtysomething um-hum in the past uh now now that it has gone off uh some comedy shows uh i can't can't think of off hand of yeah what what are your what is we do not watch a lot of TV we try to watch it on Thursday nights we usually watch LA Law i like that real well yeah and Cheers we like to watch that yeah ah we like to watch that uh we sort of got hooked on LA Law um do you ever watch that yeah uh yeah yeah we we we try to catch that most most nights yeah yeah i i have watched Thirtysomething some in the last couple seasons i was sort of sorry to see it go yeah too it it was kind of interesting uh some people complained about uh uh the kind of whining or whatever on it i i did i really did not think it was it was that way i think it had some some good uh yeah good situations that it uh presented yeah i thought a lot of the like the problems that Michael and Hope had in their marriage and stuff i can relate to some of those things and yeah just the dynamics of it and everything well i think i think a lot of people you know kind of felt that way but they had a lot of uh uh uh counseling groups that used some of the episodes as as examples of of things that were going on and uh oh really you you you know that the effect of interaction between people and sort of to use as uh as a way of getting people to talk about their problems that sort of thing uh yeah we kind of uh uh our TV viewing has uh slowed down a little bit since our our daughter came along so uh that that tends to put a cramp in your viewing because by the time you get through getting her ready for bed and everything uh it's uh very little TV time left yeah you are too tired do anything yeah it's better to spend time with your kids i think though than glued in front of the TV anyway yeah yeah that's right probably more worthwhile i just don't i don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be really no i i i can't uh i don't think there were uh i i haven't i haven't uh uh there are not as many good shows that i that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to i uh you know there uh i used to could be able to name ten shows or so you know that i felt were worth my time to watch but uh i i i very seldom like to watch there there's there's a there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch i like uh home improvement shows like Bob Vela's uh Home Home Again on Saturday morning it's enough it's like it's like This Old House but it's uh it's on instead of being on public PBS it's on regular TV but uh it's kind of interesting because i right yeah oh they renovate an old house and uh-huh yeah i've seen parts of that before it is interesting yeah so uh i i like to watch that uh some some things on PBS i like to watch but uh do you watch sports much on TV yeah if it's somebody if it's a team or something that i am really interested in i i am not one to just watch a football game just to be just to be watching it or i am not a big basketball or baseball fan if it unless it's baseball if it's some if it's a team i really like i may watch but uh yeah its uh baseball to me is a little hard to watch on TV for an extended period yeah its so slow that you just get bored i'll i'll switch between yeah it's slow something else and and and a baseball game going back and forth you know watching it but i usually if if if it's a football team i really like a college team or or pro team that i'm fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh that's the yeah we are like that and occasionally we'll like on if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something we'll watch a little bit of a golf tournament but uh you can not take a whole lot of that either it's pretty slow yeah yeah it's kind of like football like baseball uh do you watch we rent movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home because there's just nothing on Friday and Saturday nights there's nothing good on right i think that that that's um what more people are doing and i think that's you know as as TV i think that less good shows being on TV has caused a lot of people to do to do that uh you know to get more movies and watch i know we've we've done that too in the past uh we don't do it quite as much now because huh our baby won't let us watch them but uh yeah uh you know we usually will we used to rent uh two or three movies on a weekend and and and try to watch uh-huh do you have cable TV no uh we live in we don't either i thought we were the only ones who didn't have it no no we uh the uh development we moved into was they have it on on side like right across the street from us but when they built our section they didn't didn't put it in and uh-huh we've been there about two years now and they're still still do not have it so i'm hoping that gosh yeah that soon they'll they'll they'll i have contacted them about this and they say that well it's it's they look they every year they look at different areas and try to determine where where uh the most houses will be and so they uh-huh they look and they when they when we reach a certain number of people in that area they'll put one in put some in or they'll at least consider it so huh yeah yeah well we had it for awhile and it just seemed like we never watched any it we didn't have the movie channels we just had all the normal ones that come and we just never watched any of them we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it and it seemed like we didn't watch even half an hour so we decided to just cancel it it does improve the reception a little bit though that's the only thing yeah um yeah yeah i've uh i've i've uh i have i put some put in some uh an antenna a really good antenna and uh it's really helped you know ours and it's not been too bad i have not really missed it that much there are certain things that i've that i want to see you know occasionally like like a football football game a college game or something that happens to be on cable or some old movie you know i i haven't been bothered by it by it too much yeah so well i can't uh think of too much else to say since we are not big watchers well it was nice talking to you um bye right okay all right bye  okay first how much television watching do you do so i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise uh-huh that's right but do you actually watch it and pay attention to it or is it more of a company um um it just depends on what it is i mean i have my favorite things that i do and that's a fun thing to do sometimes but um what about you um-hum um-hum okay right well actually i i work full time and when i'm not working i'm running and i don't watch a lot of television and i'm very selective in what i watch if there's something that i absolutely right want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off i probably watch television four hours a week well see that's great yeah max and uh if if i don't find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on i would rather listen to music well right part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if we're doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us and we don't know where that influence came from well i think that well part i think that's partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the um yeah anyway i think it you you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials uh right right right of course i uh that's right i uh well last night for example i really would've liked to have watched Unsolved Mysteries those are fascinating to me if i have the opportunity i watch it unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels i hate that oh oh i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor oh right yeah in our comedy programs although nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can but i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians well we have cable also and and sometimes you can um get the uh HBO specials and sometimes those are really uh-huh that's right and some of those are fine programs uh-huh pretty hysterical so i i like to watch comedy i mean you know that's something but i'm not real up to date on what's going on now i i guess i have my old favorites that i uh-huh i i enjoy comedy um-hum um-hum um-hum hooked into i mean you know like Bob Newhart still on on one channel and uh you know something on that level i i also enjoy um i don't know its Sunday morning um-hum i enjoy that um-hum um-hum it's channel thirteen i watch a lot of thirteen uh The McLaughlin Group and i i just laugh i mean i think it's so hysterical these guys it's just so much fun it's just um-hum um-hum that's right um-hum it's just a lot of fun watching that i mean i don't agree with a whole lot of stuff they say but it's fun you know so yeah i watch to be entertained i really do um-hum right right well yeah i watch it for entertainment but i also watch it for uh cultural impact i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels and i watch for special programs that have special a special play a special concert uh i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah yeah uh and it was fabulous i just absolutely you just held you breath in some of those uh Patavani and uh oh i was just yeah i know so makes chills all over you so i i may or may not even look at the TV guide but if i have time i may flip through and say hey this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour uh if the hour comes and i don't get a chance to watch it so what you know well there's certain things i mean i've got um my TV in the kitchen here and um you know if there's something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows um-hum um-hum i do too it makes me want to cook and then i eat and then i get fat so i just let other people watch when i eat what they cook i i really do i know i i yeah and and there's some um in fact one of the watercolor shows on now has inspired me to take watercolor lessons you know so oh i think that's marvelous yeah oh yeah i took a lot of my college courses i took some of my college courses on television so that it's very successful for some of those things but i think i really got stung very badly you know things like that you you get a whole whole lot of exposure yeah yeah oh about having influence in your life or at least i've i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life uh my husband had an aunt who was addicted to the soaps and i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman that ever was i mean she uh-huh she thought she was absolutely i don't know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated yeah and for her to miss a soap was was a big withdrawal and oh well see that's you you you but she was probably depressed to begin with you know what i mean yeah grumpy to begin with well i don't know well she was grumpy to begin with there's no doubt about that but uh but you could clearly see those influences and in my youngsters i know that one day uh my youngsters were watching the Three Stooges and i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy yeah i hate that show but when one tried to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that wasn't funny anymore yeah i i good and i really i really feel very strong about the Bart Simpson Show i think that is the kids watch that and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid that i ever saw and i just i do not like it uh isn't that amazing how old are your kids huh mine are grown but i have grandchildren and young children around and uh for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic oh okay so that's yeah i had forgotten about that see it's just my husband and i and so i don't have that you know i uh that constant influence of the kids shows and all that but um i don't know um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah yeah well i was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home and when they were young i really did uh yeah watch what they watched i was cautious i sat down with them and i watched it and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know i i you know i distracted them changed their interest right because i just couldn't tolerate that kind of influence on my kiddos it just would and and you know they get it at school too anyway so you might as well not reinforce it you know i sure that's right that's right gosh they got they're mouthy enough anyway i know i remember going to school my parents were a lot like that too and of course we did not have any of the variety you know kids have but all the kids used to watch Rawhide and all those shows um-hum um-hum um-hum and my parents never let me watch anything like that i could watch Yogi Bear you know what kind of culture was that and i remember going to school the next day and everybody would be asking oh did you see that did you see how he did that and did you see and i could never participate um-hum yeah well um-hum um-hum and it always made me feel a little bit you know like a loner like i you know but um sure i can understand how that would happen but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to uh absolutely well i did i ran my kids to death i said hey i think that's enough television for awhile maybe we need to go outside really yeah and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company so i'd go out with them now see there's the problem parents don't do that they say you go outside and play that's true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know yeah i said but but we went on field trips and we did other things and i think that was well that's you know that's something people don't do that well here we are talking on that subject but that's that's an interesting concept i've got to stick in my um you know work with kids on but um of course  so where was your last vacation uh actually my last vacation was in Connecticut um we went home to visit family before that we were in Hawaii oh i i'd well actually i did visit Hawaii once but i never made it off of Oahu which i've heard is not the nicest of the islands oh it wasn't actually it when when we were in Oahu Oahu uh i couldn't wait to get off we we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice Kauai was nice and Maui was nice we had we had a great time we were there for ten days uh-huh oh that's wow yeah yeah yes so where have you been oh i've been i've been lots of places my last vacation was actually in Morocco i guess we that one would count uh that was about a year and a half ago and Morocco really no kidding and what what did you just decide to go there or uh well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time and we decided that i i've never been to Africa and i needed to get that continent uh-huh hadn't been there yet and it it's actually it's a fairly common vacation place for for French people to go and they speak French and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and uh-huh yeah oh i'm sure it was wonderful so we we didn't really have enough time we had about a little bit less than two weeks and as always it don't it seems a bit uh rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere uh-huh was it hot no in fact some of the days we froze it was well we were there in the winter in January uh January or February i don't remember which uh-huh really uh-huh uh-huh i was born in Saudi Arabia and uh when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know in in Europe and whatnot but i was very young so i don't remember that and uh-huh at what at excuse me at what age did you i was three when we moved back here so i don't remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been and that i was when i was a baby but so Morocco i think would be wonderful because that's you know that's oh that's too bad because uh-huh that area of the world i think would be great yeah it was a very interesting vacation the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um uh-huh the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people definite there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off yeah uh-huh and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but really we we found that in Jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that but they uh-huh they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would come up and ask you you know if if you want to buy different things and really after awhile it really gets annoying you know it it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you yeah the the worst place was in Marrakech uh-huh in the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide uh-huh it doesn't matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you and it's worth it and it's like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you oh really really and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well that's great where else have you been uh yes no actually i haven't been all through Europe like i haven't been to Italy yet uh we're going to go for a conference in September and so well you lived in France so you've been all through Europe no really hopefully we'll get to travel a little bit too uh my more exciting spots have been i've been to the Galapagos Islands uh-huh really uh-huh that was one of the most wonderful vacations i've ever had yes if you like wildlife it's a fabulous vacation lots of wildlife huh yeah uh-huh if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest but it that was really really fabulous and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close um August eighty eight now when was that when were you there uh-huh and then actually after there i went to um Hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings uh-huh and so i went to Hawaii and then to Australia uh-huh and Japan and China did you go on the Barrier Reef did you see the Great Barrier Reef and and go snorkeling i i actually i didn't go diving i i'm a diver and so that's that's actually been another of my oh diving favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips uh-huh but uh no i didn't get to the Great Barrier Reef i drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide Adelaide it's gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible it's huge uh-huh is it really yeah yeah did you have shrimp i've seen in you know they they show all this wonderful seafood and and great big prawns you know the big shrimp and Australia yeah uh but i don't remember if i had shrimp no didn't have shrimp there huh i remember food i don't think so oh i like that too but uh in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people but uh uh-huh uh-huh oh you're adventurous you went by yourself really uh-huh and i was by myself in China too yeah really oh wow China was a little bit more uh of a challenge but it it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time and so i never you know got out by myself or not much uh-huh uh-huh was it very expensive no actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i don't really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from Hong Kong you're kidding no kidding uh-huh because i was already in Hong Kong and um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and i went to Beijing Shanghai Chengdu and actually then i too k a train up from Shanghai to a little Quingdao i think is the name of it it's a little uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai it's just a train ride and that i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights uh-huh and a couple of other things all for a thousand dollars wow that really surprises me i guess i relate it to to Japan where things are very expensive aren't they yeah yeah oh Japan Japan's ridiculous and i stayed i didn't stay in t he top of the line hotels but i stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and uh-huh they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you can't stay in the cheap stuff uh-huh yeah yeah and you don't want to stay in the very very very exclusive because you don't really even get a flavor of the country if you're yeah yeah wow right right uh but yeah that was that i highly recommend that way to go if you're ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston oh really yeah um and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this woman's name to contact and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver uh-huh uh-huh and a guide and then  well i grew up out in the country and uh was used to having uh guns around the place and uh i'm uh-huh i'm not for gun control in the strictest sense of the uh word uh-huh i i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself you know i have quite a collection myself and you know i'm a good hunter and i yeah started hunting when i was twelve years old of course my parents made me take hunters safety classes and you know i don't want to see them ban guns completely but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either yeah yeah well i i feel that its uh i think the what was it the National Rifle Association uh had this bumper sticker a few years back if uh about if you outlaw guns only outlaws will have guns then so i believe that and i believe that too because the person that's wanting to commit a crime is going to find a way to get a gun gun gun a knife a a rock a stick whatever it is to commit a crime with yeah yeah and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns uh we can handle it but there's a element that can't yeah and it's you know it's got to the point now where even our our police departments and our DEA agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons because everybody that's in drug trafficking trafficking has got them you have got them outgunned you know yeah so there was a an article in the paper just this week where i think it's uh one of the gun companies i can't remember which was developing a ten millimeter ten millimeter automatic pistol for the FBI which would give them additional firepower it had held like a fifteen shot clip which uh would be able they they would be able to put down anything that came at them um yeah yeah that would be but if you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an Uzi machine gun uh a a a thirty eight uh Smith and Wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good yeah that's no it's sure not huh-uh yeah i have lived in uh Illinois at one time and they they passed a uh it wasn't really gun control but it was you had to register as a gun owner you didn't have to list your guns yeah but you had to have this card it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition hum and that's the first uh this was twenty years ago but they had that so that uh they were trying to control it a little bit uh in that respect yeah see in California they pardon in California they make you register when you buy ammunition yeah uh-huh you have to sign a they you know take your name and driver's license number hunter hunting license number and all that good stuff before you can buy any big ammunition yeah yeah especially for handguns now rifles aren't too bad but yeah you know any kind of handgun at all if it will fit in a handgun and a rifle you still have to buy it or sign up for it so yeah we lived in Tennessee for awhile and i bought a pistol there and there was a fifteen day waiting period you had to fill out an application and go down to the sheriff's office and get fingerprinted uh-huh gee and then you had fifteen days while they checked to see if you had any kind of criminal record before that you could pick up the gun you were purchasing gee that's not a bad idea and no i think that uh you know a a waiting period uh can make a difference but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that yeah yeah yeah it is so there's i don't think there's any way to control the criminal element as far as guns is concerned because no the the only way they could do it i think would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun right right you know i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit course i i feel kind of weird about that anyway i think if somebody shoots somebody they ought to be shot so yeah i'm we we're getting into capital punishment now but i i agree with you there that uh yeah but you know it would definitely be gun control yeah the uh the again the purpose of gun control is to control how it's being used is what the purpose should be yeah yeah it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose legal purpose but to keep the guy that's illegal from getting his hands on one yeah yeah yeah and i'm in favor of keeping the the illegal guy from getting one in his hands but the legal person or lawful person should not be penalized because there is the criminal element myself yeah well and the they're actually a necessity in life you know they're not you know not everybody needs a gun but oh yes sooner or later i need one you know whether i'm out hunting or you know i've never had to protect my life or well i did in the service but not you know not on the street yeah so i don't really need one in the aspect in the aspects you don't have to carry one in your car or your uh or your pocket all the time yeah no huh-uh oh so mine are you know i use mine for recreation i don't and i enjoyed my guns i have a good time with them so yeah yeah well i know what uh i took my kids out and taught them how to shoot a gun gun my wife the same thing uh she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not not that i have an arsenal or anything but we have several guns around the house yeah one of these days my grandkids probably probably yeah but i think it's uh you got to have have the places living in Dallas there's not that many places to go shoot no huh-uh but uh still i think they ought to know how to use one and it is not just a toy and that when it's not like on TV when someone gets shot uh they get back up if someone gets shot with a real gun they don't get back up yeah yeah i had to explain that to my i've got a six year old now and and he you know i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old well they understand now yeah you know i've taken time to teach them and now the young boy wants to know and you know like i told him you're a little bit young for a gun let me go out here and you know we'd start with the BB gun deal you know so he started with the BB gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows and i took it away from him i said now yeah you know so he's learning the hard way but at least it was a BB gun not a twenty two or a four ten or something so yeah uh i remember i had an old uncle up by Tulsa Oklahoma that took me out and uh showed me this was it was not my it was my mother's uncle this was a gentleman in his sixties gee and he took me out with him and uh single shot twenty two and taught me how to shoot we went squirrel hunting and uh-huh all right and uh he taught me how to shoot uh an old single shot twenty two and i probably i was probably about twelve at the time and i thought that was the neatest thing at first and Uncle Sam took me out took me hunting with h im and he let me shoot and showed me how uh-huh yeah all right i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one right you know i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away so oh yeah well that's about all i we agreed pretty well on this i think so okay well it's been real nice talking with you okay bye yeah i think so uh all right have a good one bye-bye  um i i personally have a lot of feelings about the way our judicial system is run but um yeah really i do not know i just uh i i do not know i have you ever been for called for jury duty no i haven't have you no i haven't and oh is that you i am still here oh okay uh a friend of mine was just called before and uh it's amazing the that they have to go through about four hundred people to get a a jury for this one case good grief because um there was everybody seemed to have some sort of bias you know uh very hard to find um you know extremely um um yeah impartial people but anyway i think it would be interesting but um yeah impartial how do you what do you think about the way it's run well well the you know on the suggested topic was to talk about whether uh verdicts had to be unanimous decisions right and i thought that was that really got me to thinking you know and i think we really need them to be unanimous um-hum because i'd hate to think that that you know if if i was charged with something that i was not guilty of that i got convicted on a you know seven to five verdict yeah that's true that's a good point um aren't they supposed to be unanimous though now isn't that the way it is okay you know yeah they are i think they need to stay that way yes i agree i do although i do not know i think the judge should be involved i really at this point i am not sure how it works but let's say that a jury decides somebody is guilty yeah and the judge disagrees it it's not the judges final decision right it's the jury's right it's absolutely up to the jury see and and my feeling is this judge knows a whole i do not know i mean that's his job you know that and it seems like all he is is a mediator mediator of the whole thing i know it but then if if you give him too much power you know that who knows i mean we got crooked cops well that's true yep you're right there's crooked everybody i know it it's really scary because you know you see i do not know if you ever watch saw the movie Presumed Innocent did you see that oh my God it's fabulous if you ever can rent it or something so no i didn't is it i've been trying to and it's never there yes really it's just great and it it's scary because it's just about that there are crooked cops and the whole case points to this one guy and you know he is innocent and um that that kind of stuff ought to scar us to death i mean yeah it does and then you watch this guy go to jail for um i should not be telling you because you are going to want to see it well i knot that he goes it it for the murder right yeah and he goes to jail um i just and oh it's really scary that would be awful yeah but but then i also see um oh i do not know this one case here in Rochester where um we had a serial killer and they finally caught him and it here he the guy had basically admitted to killing twelve girls yeah unbelievable and um good grief yet it was it was almost a type of thing where he almost wasn't guilty because they had this little flaw one piece of evidence that's that's what bothers me the technicalities and that's where i think the judge maybe ought to have more say you know uh ah yeah right i agree because i can't believe that that we can let the people off that we are letting off because you did not tell them this one statement before you took them to jail you know like um-hum right oh right or the whole the Marion Berry thing you know the the governor uh how they determined that he was um oh i do not know it was set up or something yeah it's just i mean this guy is dealing drugs it's not set up he was just doing it yeah you know i'm sorry he was doing it entrapment i'm sorry you know uh-huh i would love to be on a jury because i i do think it's fascinating i i i think it it's it's hard system i mean you are never going to get a right and a wrong you know it's just there's no blacks and whites it's shades of gray that that's right yep and i think i am like you i think it would be really fascinating i do not think i would want to be on a highly publicized case though i do not think i would like that at all me either because it is tense for the jurors that were on this serial killing uh they couldn't read the newspaper they couldn't watch TV they couldn't talk about it and this went on for like six months i'm sure well you know they had uh a big drug trial in Roanoke Virginia a couple of years ago and my my husband was called for jury duty on that and he said that they had guards armed um-hum huh really you know guards posted everywhere and he was really glad that he wasn't called because he said that this would have been too much wow yeah so i wouldn't like that at all oh my goodness i like Judge Wapner type of thing yeah a real simple uncomplicated thing you know right like uh my dog bit the neighbor or something we could start out small and work our way up yeah exactly so but it's just it's scary because um there there's just so much that can go wrong that could let an innocent person be convicted or a guilty person have them let go absolutely that the nuances and yeah and um i do not know i guess it's it i do not know a lot about the terms but a hung jury is that when the it's not completely unanimous that yeah you know it would be split one way or another and and that ends in a mistrial oh so what happens nothing so they have to retry them they have to bring in a whole new jury they have to absolutely start over again oh oh my God so and i do not know how many times you can have a hung jury i do not know if they the i don't guess they have to go back to um-hum trial i guess you know they could drop the charges if they didn't think they'd ever convict him um-hum did you see Sixty Minutes by any chance on um i guess it was this past Sunday night they showed a guy who um he's a lawyer and what he's like known for now is getting men um no i didn't uh-hum off of charges of killing their wives or their ex-wives yeah isn't that lovely so there's this guy um i forget what his name is and he is a lawyer someplace and he's gotten so far about four or five oh that's nice men um free of the charge one guy went in stabbed his ex-wife to death because she was sleeping with another guy i mean ex-wife you know we're talking and oh my gosh yeah well and um he got them off on the basis that he went temporarily insane yeah i'll bet he did right temporally insane that she provoked this in him because he was so madly in love with her that seeing you know this other man with her just drove him crazy oh and it was her fault that he killed her yeah exactly it was her fault her uh they interviewed her parents it was crazy so now he has to serve like six months in a rehab center and sure and get psychiatric treatment exactly  i've uh i've well i've had i used to have the opinion that there was that there really wasn't any more crime in America in the cities anyway than there was in previous centuries uh before uh simply because the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced uh reporting methods with computers and other devices compile more statistics that's right and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets um-hum however i have been persuaded lately i guess simply by the uh overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime more especially where you are you in Washington DC or Washington state well yeah no i am in i am in Washington D C yeah yeah i was going to say actually it you know i do a lot of business here and i come here quite often and and that again is a is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in Washington oh yeah regardless of the racial makeup but it's it's these real uh there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they uh it just really grabs your attention it just makes the whole place seem like that yeah right now just to focus on that a minute i guess uh um when um previous secretary of uh educate Bennett i think his name was became the drug czar uh for uh uh President Bush he was going to focus on it yeah on this area and do something about it and i see that even he was met without with with little success even though the entire i guess a a quite a bit of money and and other uh planning efforts went into that what do you what do you think is is causing all this because it seems that there there even though crime though though i think it is increasing in number it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity and violence too well yes well i uh i have three theories about it you know three things i have one theory and it's by two things one i i believe that this is a function of uh the violence that young people see on television and in the movies um-hum and i am not just talking about you know uh role models of uh of tough guys and gangsters and things like that i'm i'm not even i'm not even convinced that maybe things like uh football hockey and the the and and you know the the and even baseball games now where the everything is settled with a fight you know the the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle the uh the argument and and then i i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree so i think that particularly i i was reading the other day about uh Corpus Christi Texas which has the highest i think it's Corpus Corpus Christi that had the highest rates per hand gun death in America hum uh per capita i mean the Saturday night special stuff so that that's what i think about it that's some of the things i think about it plus uh yeah i i haven't seen that but uh yeah i know what are your views well yeah i tend to agree with you with you know it seems anymore uh a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some some sort of violence or something in it and and along with that you know and then you start making a movie and yes it it has no there's no call for something violent but so they just throw something in there just to say they have it exactly well that's that's that's the impression i get yeah yeah and i and i imagine it's it you know it just feeds upon itself when when we have this sort of violence in society people want to it conditions people to it and uh you have to emphasize it has to be even uh magnified to attract people's attention i guess to have them spend money on something like that and i am sure that it does form role models for young for young men and young women and yeah you become callous yeah yeah uh i mean i i read now where where you know women are arrested young women are arrested fighting with knives over over whatever whatever reason which is kind of unheard of when i was young now i do not want to sound like an old fart but but that that's what it seems that those things happened before um it didn't happen in that manner before television and i i i i have to think that that it has some influence on it yeah i listening to a radio talk show today at lunch time uh Rush Limbaugh i do not know if you listen to him or not he's on AM but uh there there's a fellow that had called in and was but yeah no lamenting about the uh that there was a interview done on the assistant chief of police for Los Angeles the guy under Gates and they were just really coming down on him because of oh yes some of the things he was just some of the things that he believed in some of his morals for instance uh they asked him if he spanked his kids and he said you bet i believe in discipline and people i i i i guess they confuse confused discipline with punishment yeah you know and just it seems anymore that uh if if you have yeah you know this type of a moral stance that people come down on you it's like you know hey everybody has to be free to do their own thing and i disagree and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime yes yes well i mean i i guess so what i wanted to say and i stopped uh i do not know i got diverted was uh that uh there's so much there's so much of a return from prison to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure and and that is not emphasized i recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process what i also think is that yeah i i guess it's the reflection of of the society where where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to uh you know it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you where you live or i do not mean responsibility attachment and responsibility i guess i mean any sort of well nobody feels responsibility to do something it's like oh boy i wish they would stop doing that yeah yes that's right that yeah i i do not know how that's i do not think it's done by uh the changes come simply by statutory nature i do not know what it really will take hum huh and i do not know if i have solutions except except to you know i am sort of a a an advocate of of uh of letting people of having free speech and i guess to curb uh television uh the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that however there does seem to be a right now in verbalizing it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort yeah yeah and then how many and the sacrifice isn't that great how how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between you know what you see and how you i mean what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do yeah yes yes i think i think that's correct and and yes but you know as soon as you start uh well Texas has uh Texas has uh has always struck me i mean i i i have lived in and out of Texas both in the service and and uh uh short business stints and it seems to me they are a pretty pretty tough law and order state but but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state just citing that you know yeah uh unfortunately you man got a lot of the uh some well a lot of it can be contributed to the the the racial differences i mean just you know we are so close to the border with Mexico we've got a lot of that influence yeah yeah  okay um do you have a large house or do you live in an apartment or or like well we live in uh it's a single family home and i guess it um uh-huh it's kind of well sort of big for the area um and it's got uh four bedrooms and two and a half baths and uh its on a color sack uh-huh how about yours uh well we have a pretty large home and uh it's larger than the average house you know in the area uh-huh but um we need a large home cause there's twelve kids in my family so uh we have five bedrooms uh two kitchens two full kitchens uh we have wow two and a half baths also uh-huh you know uh plus we have a full basement that's in a into a game room that's wall to wall carpeting wow you know um we have uh it would be like a i do not know i guess it would be like a family room other than from the playroom the playroom is where we watch all our TV and stuff but we have another room you know kind of like for company and stuff huh right uh let me think that's about all but it's all split level split level house yeah okay well ours is a ranch style and uh oh i like ranch style houses we we had a townhouse here uh we still have a townhouse which we are renting out so this is our first uh i guess single family home and so we find that we have uh a lot to do uh to fix it up to the way we like it a lot of remodeling and all uh mostly cosmetic and we had a a deck put in in the back uh-huh um-hum so it looks you know that's real nice to go out in now and then a fence around the yard so that the kids can stay in the yard yeah and not run around the neighborhood well how much uh land did you get with it how much what land uh i think it was a quarter acre uh-huh is it we have almost an acre yeah it's it's funny because we have um really that's a pretty big area a a two stall garage right beside our house but you can fit four cars in it it's long enough you know you can fit four in uh-huh and and some people that don't know us ask which house we live in and it's like oh just our garage then uh we have a front porch and a back porch on our house and our back porch we enclosed uh-huh but that's kind of like another room on itself uh okay well what we have our family room when ah you know we bought it we noticed that it was really dark and uh one of the things that it has in it is uh real dark paneling wooden paneling uh-huh and uh it also has brown carpet and just kind of uh two small windows so what we are thinking of doing is uh uh changing the carpet to a lighter color and then we have heard that with the paneling you can wallpaper over it uh-huh or paint it and so that's what we are planning to do is to put a chair rail across the family room paint or wallpaper from the chair rail up and then uh paint the chair rail on down in in like a a light blue color sort of i guess uh-huh uh Williamsburg blue we are calling it but whether there's there's a color like that or not since we are near Williamsburg but uh we are hoping that will lighten up the room a lot and make it give it you know give it a bigger appearance it has a fireplace in it too yeah uh-huh and if that doesn't work we uh our next door neighbor is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so oh yeah we'll try that last resort if uh if the painting does not help yeah well all our walls are white you know well they are plaster except for our you know in the basement the playroom and we have um it's a real light brown you know kind of like a tan uh-huh uh-huh and uh the carpet is pretty light too so it's it's it is a pretty large you know playroom and the lighter colors do help makes it look much bigger than what it really is um-hum what kind of carpeting do you have um it it has different colors in it but when you first look at it it just kind of looks like a brownish color you know it has like browns and yellows in it uh-huh oh okay yeah is it uh is it a real short or a thick carpet real short real short yeah okay because we were looking at something that people are we have seen advertised called i guess it's berber or something or berbar or something and uh and we understand that that's supposed to be good for like a family room cause it's you know it wears really well and all that yeah see well because we have so many with a real thick carpet with so many of us it gets worn down too fast so uh most of the carpet in our house is the short carpet right right um-hum in fact well we just got our uh like where we where we have company and stuff we just got that recarpeted and we think it's uh bigger carpet you know the longer thicker stuff but uh as the little ones were starting to move out and stuff so you know there's not as many of us here now uh-huh right yeah the other thing we are learning a lot about is uh we have a craw space under the house um-hum and we are learning a lot about moisture free and uh everything like that um-hum so uh as far as uh keeping the vents open and closed you know this is all new to us not having a house that had this before and and uh keeping the vents open you know during when it's warm and summer and all that and i guess spring summer fall and i guess in the winter you close the vents and and making sure that the rain the rain gutters from you know the roof and all empty out i instead of right near the house yeah and things like that uh-huh well we have a wood burner in our house and you know it heats a lot of it because it is a larger house would be too much to heat with just electric but uh we have yeah so we were uh-huh uh-huh a wood a wood burning stove is it in the middle of the room or against the wall it's against the wall uh-huh uh it's down in the basement and it's kind of like in and enclosed little room by itself uh-huh my dad enclosed it off so you kind of go into another room to it uh but we had to learn to keep like all all the bedrooms are two floors above it and we had to learn to keep all the uh-huh the rooms were shut on the first floor for the hot air to get up to the bedrooms for like in the winter and stuff uh okay right ye ah wow that's pretty neat but uh i guess do you have much mowing to do with yours then much mowing yeah well actually it's a lot bigger than we thought it was when we first saw it when we actually have to mow it it seems to get bigger but uh the mow the way ours is is it's kind of a pie shaped yeah uh you know boundaries or whatever and we are sitting against the pointy end of the pie the house sits back and it so our front yard is actually the bigger yard and um oh uh-huh and when we first got here you know there's it it i guess a long time ago it uh you know we were talking to our neighbors and they said the yard was one of the better or the best yard in the neighborhood because really kept it up and over the years uh just people were just renting it out and all that they a lot of weeds and all that have grown up oh yeah and so we have decided to get somebody for one year of service to help control the weeds and get it green again and then i will take over from there and so but i have to mow it at least once a week or else it looks bad uh-huh yeah well uh it well we have just an acre we uh so use a rider yeah yeah definitely and uh well my mom hates dandelions so we had stuff on our yard you know but it's uh it's pretty green she likes a nice green yard uh-huh  yep okay i i do a fair amount of cooking uh-huh and i love having guests to dinner i probably do that at about once a month and uh i usually prepare something depending upon the guests you know if if i like to prepare chicken that seems to please please everybody pasta or a casserole how about you um-hum yeah those are things i like the most i like fish and chicken the most um and um most i cooking i do just comes out of a can uh unless unless it is unless it is i catch a fish and i prepare it and then i just uh you know i just broil it and put lemon on it um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish um-hum uh i made scallops the other night that was unusual and uh basically uh i found a recipe to to make it in the microwave and you sprinkled the you you swished around a little melted butter and do uh oh i do not know microwave microwaved them for about nine minutes no no four four and a half five minutes and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top very simple but very nice so if you are looking for a fish recipe that was good sesame seeds and bread crumbs sesame seeds and bread crumbs uh-huh and uh my husband liked it yeah and uh no unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive uh fish items right uh-huh but you know i i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store uh one of the things i love to do eat out how about you oh yeah uh-hum do you have any particular places you like going oh there's a restaurant called String Bean on Spring Valley and Central uh-huh i like that it's just it's just home cooking yes i've been there um-hum and uh i kind of kind of like the black eyed pea but i don't think it's a chain right exactly uh-huh and that's that's the other restaurant also think they got black eyed pea oh so i don't really like uh you know uh chili places or what is it Judge Roy Bean's or oh i don't like greasy places yeah yeah i i i don't feel like they are very healthy and i always feel like the home cooking places are are the healthiest meals even though i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go go to them yeah right and i and i got uh chicken marinara the last two times you know oh how was it it was i was great because that's that's what i like i don't like it you know it's like a baked um you know a piece of chicken and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes um-hum you know yeah i i tend to uh i get teased by my family a lot because uh i like experimenting on on food and sometimes i go for exotic fairly exotic things and and my father teases me about gourmet cooking um-hum which is not always true but and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else is that some of the experiments fail no that's true uh the last time we had some uh friends over for dinner i tried the dessert that sounded wonderful wonderful in the recipe and it was just total bust yeah i was sorry i didn't have ice cream to fall back on yeah my uh my brother tried to make a bunch of things uh way back he tried to make bagels one time oh my that's ambitious yeah and uh we took some and and we had uh German shepherds at the time and we took some and gave it to the dogs and the dog never you know he treated it like a milk bone and he never did finish it he barely made a dent in it hum yeah and and uh then he tried to make grapefruit citron one time uh-huh it's uh supposed to be a candy yeah and uh it it didn't turn out very well it was you know it it like made concentrated all the acid of the grapefruit into uh into a kind of a candy stick so huh see i am not that's interesting one of the things i don't make is dessert um-hum and uh my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert deprivation because you know we have ice cream or something like that and that's why when i took did this experiment for this company we had about three weeks ago it was just a total fiasco um-hum huh um everything else was fine but that was a fiasco well you have to put eggs and everything don't you or uh yeah yeah just about yeah and i i also don't have much of a sweet tooth so i can live without live without desserts for the most part uh-huh use about half the sugar or make everything diet yeah uh do you cook for yourself or do you cook for others mostly i just cook for myself yeah well when i was single i used to uh i think my favorite meal was a a baked potato um-hum it's easy that's for sure and oh yeah yeah oh yeah and i mean i never put anything other than a little butter on it if i had or or if i had a little cheddar cheese sometimes i would grate that up hum yeah i always put cheese on them and uh amazingly satisfying um-hum yeah but you know there's hardly any i guess there's hardly any protein it's mostly starch fills you up and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get yeah i didn't i didn't say it was nourishing but it was satisfying oh yeah it really is then you have to make a salad or and yeah yeah that but you know um i i never really enjoyed cooking for myself so i ate very simply and i was um-hum that's why i think that's one reason i like having people over because i could try things i mean i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that cause cooking is a little bit like like being in a chemistry lab right um-hum and uh except you get to taste the product instead of instead of having an explosion foam up or blow up or sometimes it blows up anyway oh yeah you know i i once had a an old boy friend over to to dinner when i was just briefly staying with my parents and uh i had this wonderful recipe and and you were supposed to make a a toffee like substance for a pie by uh boiling evaporated milk three hours and it does turn to toffee inside the can oh yeah and uh the only problem was when i opened the can it just flew all over the place it was on the ceiling on the walls and me and and the boyfriend saw that he was supposed to be there at six o'clock not seven o'clock so just at the time all this happened the door bell rang and there he was and i had to have my my my my dad sort of entertain him for a for for awhile while my mother and i scrambled to clean everything up right uh-huh did you let the can cool off uh i really don't remember that was about ten years ago i just remember how embarrassing it was and i have made i have made it since i've i i and several times before and i never had that problem just that one time yeah huh yeah and uh he he was a gourmet cook he was kind of person who acted like he came from San Francisco and he had a very sophisticated taste i i really wanted to impress the heck out of him and and well it was a memorable evening anyway right uh but i i do enjoy cooking so i was awfully glad i was given this  okay where have you been on vacation lately um well the last vacation i went was to Cozumel and that was last uh March and April oh yeah have you got another one planned not at this point um although if we take another vacation i think we might like to go to Cancun this time have you been there yeah yeah we went there well actually i went there before i got married i haven't been back with Kyle yet but he is very much wanting to go there and since i have some free tickets with some frequent flyer stuff that's where he wants to go but um also since my parents my in-laws just moved to Utah we're kind of pressured to go up there and go snow skiing and i've never been snow skiing so i'm not really into that i would rather do the beach scene i agree i mean if i'm going to go on vacation i want to lay out in the sun and relax yeah drink tropical drinks definitely do that and someplace i'd like to go is like to the other side of the Caribbean as you you know as opposed to the Mexican side i want drink rum drinks and uh oh really lay on those beaches over there like in the in the Virgin Islands that sounds good another place that i heard is really pretty is uh the Cayman Islands oh yeah although i hear they're expensive yeah that's definitely true well i got a magazine the other day called Caribbean Life and it had um different charter boats in there where like three couples could could charter a boat and have a crew and everything but um you just pretty much go wherever you want to go and they had great summer rates so like if you do it before September or October or something like that you really save a ton of money and i would love to do that well our tenth anniversary is coming up in October uh-huh yeah and uh oh really i didn't know that i'd like to you even if we just get away for three or four days i think it would be kind of neat yeah just to do something originally a couple years ago we were hoping to do a trip to Greece um but uh i don't think that's going to be possible now um that'd be fun now that is probably the number one place on earth that i would like to go um-hum really wow well all the pictures i've ever seen of it has just been gorgeous but i don't know i think i think i'd there's other places that i would rather go first i think maybe like where um Australia and down in there i mean the the pictures i've seen of that even um oh i had a when i was in school i had a nun that was from um oh i can't even think of the island now but she told us just wonderful stories of the island and and the pictures she showed us and all that i can't think of the place now it's a pretty big one oh Venezuela i don't think that's an island but that's okay well uh i wherever she wherever she was she was out you know on the edge but anyway she uh had some great pictures and i always thought that would be fun to go there and they have great beaches too well the main place that Nick would like to go is uh Rio yeah oh really yeah um-hum he's been talking about that for years hey that would be fun yeah when i was little i always heard how romantic Rio was but i would like to go to Tahiti too that'd be fun but even just like in the States it was fun when we went to Mackinac Island that was pretty cool that's uh up in Michigan yeah we talked about doing one of those drive around trips you know you drive around yeah i guess Lake Michigan and then you take the ferry over to the other side and um-hum oh really huh but i'd only want to do that in the summer yeah because it i was there at the end of July and it was still pretty cool so yeah i'm not not a cold weather person at all no neither am i well um um um i think that uh once we get the house refinanced we're going to probably try to take our free tickets and either go to Cancun or do the little uh trip to California Southern California and then on up to Utah so i don't know we'll see well Nick just got back from San Diego last night and he said it was absolutely gorgeous and i haven't been there since i guess it was seventy three oh really uh and uh i'd love to go back that was just one of the prettiest places on earth i have ever seen yeah i think i'm going to uh work in a business trip and go to San Diego how do you work in a business trip you'll have to ask Bill how my business trips work they work very well and i have definitely needed a business trip lately uh-huh uh-huh well since you already set up the office out in Southern California there's nothing left for me well that's true hadn't thought about that and it doesn't appear we're going to be opening any new offices well they could get really big though and hire a secretary and then you could have to go train that'd be all right yeah tell them to do that i guess we're straying from the uh the vacation part of it yes but i mean a trip is a trip that's right i'll go anywhere so oh i would too in a drop of a hat fortunately we aren't tied down with uh any other little two legged responsibilities we can go um-hum you can do that yeah yeah makes makes a big difference as a matter of fact i was offered a free ticket air ticket today if i want one well take it well eventually i might but Archie offered me a ticket um-hum oh really well good and uh i thought we'd you know i wouldn't want to just take it but he has American and a couple of other ones and he said they just go to waste uh-huh and i Nick's going to New Orleans in January i think next year i haven't been there for so long ooh i love New Orleans oh yeah such good food and drinks oh yeah well and even just to go sit in the bars and listen to the jazz that's so much fun oh yeah yeah or watch the people or the hookers go up and down the street oh God yeah that's the first time i ever saw an actual transvestite i think was in New Orleans oh i saw them in uh San Diego i went to a shore a show you know one of those transvestite shows really oh yeah yeah that was something well i guess i'll go take my shower i've been working out so i'll do that okay well i'll talk to you later okay now do you push the buttons now no we just hang up okay talk to you later bye okay bye  the space program seems to have run into a little bit of a snag funding wise anyway they've decided the space station's not may not be worth it and uh they're going to fight over that for a few years it seems and uh just the idea of flight uh the shuttle system and what they thought they could do and what they're ending up doing and the complexity and the seeming uh number of errors and breakdowns and problems they're having with it uh it may not be common thing all too soon and even if they ever do get it common uh or get it to where you know the a large percentage or even a a one to two percent of of a given nation ends up in space for for some reason or another um they haven't solved and i don't know if they can solve the problem that weightlessness has extended weightlessness has on the human body i mean right we can do all we want as far as technology goes but if a human can't stand to be up there then what good does is it to have the station that for extended stays if you can't stand an extended stay right so i don't know if uh if all the monies that are being spent on it uh really should be spent with the idea of uh or with the goal of of the space station or of claiming a sector of space or having defense out in space i don't mind spending the money from the standpoint of uh basically government funded uh research and development and you know it's tends to create jobs our our economy tends to be uh based on a lot of a lot of that lately of course it really wreaks havoc with the economy when the government decides to shut down things like bases and and uh like Carswell and things of that nature right so what do you think about the the uh whole space program as it were uh well i'm i'm kind of with you they've they've definitely run into some problems and i think it's it's some it's it's due to their own shortsightedness uh perhaps the trying to do too much too quickly uh and you know they take take some i think that they thought thought that they were going to get a lot more done quickly than they then they really did they didn't think out all of the the variables that uh that might crop up and then they've been hit with a lot of those uh a lot of i think they've had a lot of poorer management poor management here in the past uh several years no no clearly defined goals uh uh a and and goals that are that were obtainable you know they they they needed to look at the long long range picture i think that that um-hum uh the Soviets have have done a better job of that you know they they were very uh they were limited so much in their technology and but they because of that they they tended to say what we're going to do what we do and continue to do it and do it over the long haul and so that's what they've done and they've they've uh you know they they've had a man in space in space for you know a quite a long time you know in in in in the different space stations that they've had and uh so that that you know that's been good for them they've learned a lot and they've they've made some achievements in in that respect but they've they've been right doing it very slowly and very long range you know um-hum and we haven't done that we tend to to look at uh a big uh a big project that we like to to have done you know you know do the shuttle thing and and and have it as a you know a space transport system you know up in the next ten years and you can't do that you know i mean it's just not not feasible feasible but you know the Americans uh American publics doesn't like to sit back and wait you know ten years for something to get developed and and put up with with especially with funding the way it is yeah right uh i uh i think there are definite benefits from from the from the process of of creating space projects you know we you know we've seen that in terms of computers and and the the myriad of different uh technological advances but uh like you say you have to kind of weigh that as to what is it worth in the long you know for for the overall uh picture uh how much we willing to to put out for to have Teflon on our on our our cooking pans and right you know you really don't want the economy to or the space program to become a too large percentage of the economy so that when something catastrophe some catastrophe does occur and it does have to be curtailed you you don't gut the economy sort of like the defense industry problem has has occurred uh as as needs changed in the defense world then right you go and cut back on your spending and it cripples whole sections of the nation as it were with the lack of jobs and lack of whatever else you do that with the space program and now as complex and as many different directions as they're being tugged with technology uh they want to be so big that if we ever did allow that um uh we're liable to be in the same boat and once these contracts are finished or if the space pra platform disintegrated for whatever reason uh maybe there'd be that many thousands of jobs that were supplying prats you know parts to that that weren't there anymore you'd have to go back to the jobs that needed to right right be there when that was being created instead of being sustained and you know you you can't have uh a quarter of the economy resting on one little project up there so it it gets kind of complicated when you start talking getting that big plus you get so many different directions uh not being limited by technology here in the US but being limited by the whims of changing funding uh it needs even that much more or or better management from uh the NASA people to keep a clear goal and a relatively a reasonable one in sight as it were right so i don't know it's a it's a complex issue but you know i i mean i would love to see you know big things like that happen i mean i've you know i've i went through the entire and i grew up in that early sixties you know big big boom of um-hum of uh you know all those Mercury and Gemini and uh Apollo shots and and and was real caught up in that and would love to see something big happen you know i'd like to see that that occur but you like you say it's it's a it is it is a drain and you don't it would cost an enormous amount of money to put that up yeah put something up like a space station that would work and really really be beneficial for us and uh i don't i don't know it's if it's worth it well they keep talking about uh the space station the biggest thing they want to do up there is is test out different manufacturing techniques uh in weightlessness but are these i i never could quite figure out whether these techniques were something that could be done yeah uh uh simulated or we learn enough about it to do it down here on earth or are we talking about having to build some sort of a station that is going to produce these products and how much could you really produce in a lab up there uh i don't i don't really guess i understand what they're going to do unless they're going to turn out product from that  are you ready um-hum she didn't announce that to you oh i didn't i didn't quite hear all of it oh i see that's fine um i think uh that's pleasurable for all of us if we choose the right restaurant right so what are your thoughts on dining out well i i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else not for the price well a little bit for the price but uh i think that as far as quality of food goes the most some of the most expensive places i've been had the the really the the worst quality of food okay uh-huh the really okay really um a lot of places that even don't look don't look like much some of the some of the best food i have ever had was out of a outside or inside of a place that we drove up and i was like um-hum i'm not eating in there are you nuts and uh we went in and it was the most it was the most wonderful food my word it's like mama in the back kitchen huh yeah i'm serious oh yeah um a lot of uh one place that we went just recently uh was to Atchafalaya no that's not right that's not right that's not right what's the name of that restaurant um-hum okay the Hari Krishna Kalachandji's it's all vegetarian and it was just fabulous i mean my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it wow and where was that at um Kalachandji's it's uh it's a Hari Krishna run restaurant where is it in Dallas yes is it in the phone book uh i think so it should be do you know how to spell it uh it starts with a K okay Kalli K A L L I so K A L A i think C H A N D that should get you close enough to okay to be able to find it i think it's uh probably listed in the restaurants you know uh-huh section yes uh-huh but it's uh it's just fabulous food what about fast foods do you have a preference if you were going to eat a fast food well we like Arby's you do like Arby's see i don't like Arby's as far as fast food goes oh really why no because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever they use the they use the insides of the animals heart and liver and they they form it and they make it look like roast beef and i said no thank you oh no no no someone has been lying to you what they use is roast beef well that's not what i heard from one of somebody that was supposed to know what they were talking about that's what oh my goodness uh-huh i'm surprised my dad worked for Arby's for several years really yeah unless somebody is trying to blackball them well that's happened before but we like good uh we we're we like Mexican food um-hum okay and stuff like that so um how about the health food uh restaurants well like this one but it's probably not advertised as such is it or a health food uh-huh health food uh restaurants that like like name one i'm not sure what you're talking about well well like um well i can't really think of any off the top of my head right now because there's so few and far between but they ought there are restaurants that cater to the people that are very health conscious you know as far as their cholesterol levels and their their fat content and you know the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product and they list them now there's one restaurant that does that and it's called Rodolfo's over on Preston Road and Royal Lane i believe and they have very good food over there hum i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that so i really don't have anything to compare it to uh-huh uh-huh they do list um you know list the fat it would be good i think uh i don't know how expensive they are it sounds like that it would probably uh-huh uh-huh well it was pretty reasonable i it was around ten dollars for lunch okay which which is kind of high for lunch i guess for one person yes oh yes uh-huh yeah a bit uh but um you were served by maitre d's and and uh um men waiters see i i won't really be interested in going to going there because i feel like i'm i'm paying you know five dollars for the food probably and five dollars for something that i could get along quite well without well if you're looking for a nice uh-hum well i guess if you were having if you were trying to impress somebody like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant it's a special occasion type thing yeah yeah maybe maybe that yeah yeah i could see that then maybe uh-hum and now the Red Lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime yeah i like the the seafood that they when they had it you know the broiled because they're well they have lunch specials that you can't you can't beat that price uh if you went to a cafeteria yeah probably that's true but i know a lot of their a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things that you can't really get away from the fried well i had the i had a broiled chicken breast and it was excellent it was a marinated broiled chicken breast and it was excellent now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken that's one of my husband's pet peeves he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak you know oh it was well i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north and that was a no no and i haven't gotten over that from the north oh really oh catfish is wonderful oh really i know they say that that is but i'm really but they've got all these caution signs now on fish and so i kind of stay away because of all the pollution in the lakes and the why oh everywhere i mean there isn't any safe haven anymore for fish hum i and especially uh in Wisconsin and Michigan they say don't buying of our fish that's too bad because i'm probably not going to stop eating it i well yeah so you i and the the best brand of chicken to buy is the uh Pilgrim Pride because they don't use all these hormones to promote uh unnatural growth in their products uh-huh yeah so i mean we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy that's true so i'm i you know i oh on one hand i see that and on the other hand uh my older sister um-hum remembers when uh at one point they were taking radioactive wastes yeah and storing them in tin barrels which i i guess had a half-life of oh five years if they sit empty on dry land corrode hum so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically and then they take these things that will rust and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more um-hum well i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good oh and then they wouldn't sink they were floating around so they shot holes in them to sink them and this is before i was born oh dear wow so i mean we're taking thirty years ago this happened and sure yeah and who's you know the tuna is radioactive that's right everything we eat everything to a certain extent you can't get away from it so i think everything we eat should have a label on it yeah to some point yeah you know so there's you know there's some things i think we can avoid we you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like you know this is not in my control well you know so i'm either going to be i'm either going to starve to death or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can you know um-hum well Becky you know even if you lived off your own land that you would have to put caution signs  okay well i'll start off being controversial i'm in favor of it that doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now well i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence need to be reevaluated i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all crimes against children is one of them okay yeah i think that oh definitely any any crimes against person yeah uh i feel uh there should be more than a slap on the hand and being sent to prison and being released in uh two or three years um-hum actually i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in Middle Eastern countries if you steal you lose a hand ooh yes that's yeah you know uh if you kill you lose your life what's wrong with that i don't see a thing wrong with that i believe that uh yeah uh well it's just an an example i think there's uh someone that's on trial right now um-hum here in the Dallas area and they were interviewing the it's a a young lady was killed sometime back a a young girl um-hum um-hum and a personal trial and the reporter was asking a sup stupid question of the people outside well how do you feel about this um-hum and they you know i thought that's um-hum how do they feel about it i'm sure that uh they want it over with and they want the person punished and punished properly um-hum um-hum but deciding what that proper punishment is is one thing i think that there should be no way i i realize that innocent people could go to uh what is it lethal injection now yes innocent people could do that but for every innocent person who would be executed hopefully there would be ten guilty yeah well i feel like the the cost of someone someone was quoting figures made the cost at like thirty thousand dollars a year uh the um-hum um-hum um-hum to maintain a prison inmate that's right that's stupid to keep someone in prison and well the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases there are more and more instances um-hum that's right being on the news where this individual was out on the streets on probation or parole and killed someone else um-hum um-hum sure sure or seriously injured someone well i don't have solutions to the problems but you know you have these this would be nice if and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory but i think that if you did something for example to an individual and caused them to lose the ability to earn a living i remember a man drove by randomly shot a women in the head while she was driving blinded her yeah i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual yes yes indeed or the family of an individual yeah uh who has been harmed you're you you know people who kill policemen policemen who are killed in the line of duty they may or may not have been willfully intending to kill that policeman but that family still has no provider yeah well here again anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind and i um-hum uh the opportunity exists for someone to get killed that's right now i'm not in favor of gun control to the n-th degree or anything because uh there are uses for guns which are non criminal um-hum but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them uh aside from domestic disputes husband shooting wives or vice versa um-hum but these individuals if they have a gun with them i think that the the sentence should be even longer than if they don't i don't i don't agree with the length of the sentence though i think expediency is the answer well well but here again uh if a matter of expediency part of these costs like the people on Death Row is that their appeals can take years and years there should be some uh i know there's a law i believe that um-hum um-hum that's right it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence um-hum well i think that automatic appeal ought to take place uh within a reasonable length of time say six months um-hum and a decision be made and not drag out in the courts um-hum for years because of misplaced commas or whatever technicalities there might be that's right technical i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals right there's there's got to be a there's got to be a time limit you you you can appeal it once i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is if if it is contradictory a a legitimate a legitimate appeal not a technicality of uh if yeah that's right uh-huh and they're not arguing that the guy or woman committed the crime they're arguing over well were his civil rights violated because uh um-hum someone didn't file the proper paper at the proper time those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think um-hum um-hum that's right well one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of of the process in which the criminals were apprehended yeah i mean uh you know the guy is guilty you know he's done what he's done you you may have stood there and seen it but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested yeah you know he he goes free uh-huh uh-huh yeah he didn't see his lawyer as quickly as he should have or or some some Mickey Mouse type thing like that right and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers and uh i oh yes i just don't think that i think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had some statute of limitations on lawyers i hope you're not a lawyer yes no i'm not a lawyer i it's i i i'm an accountant and i agree we practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers to a degree yeah absolutely that's why you check books out from the library but i really believe that there you go our justice system is is the best around but it's not perfect and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact well it's it's a case that we have a a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself that's right so that's right that's how we get caught in this uh sort of a catch twenty two um-hum that's right but you have to continue uh to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty that's right and and it i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter yeah and that just that really does ruffle my feathers at times i mean i can just get so aggravated about it yes it does most people but you know it's it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem and and i hope not lawyers but again one of our one of our problems is that uh our legislature and the state and our national congress the majority of the members there of are lawyers  well hi i guess uh i'll just start by saying that we entertain with uh a gourmet club here um which means that we have like eight eight people four couples uh-huh and most of the husbands this is really peculiar most of the husbands cook great i mean the wives during the day you know get i guess so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day um you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff but it was the guys that got together and did all this and um like my husband just oh that's nice he really really likes to cook in terms of um oh barbecue and i mean all guys i think like to barbecue i think it's caveman mentality but um he really does cook and it's a good thing because you know you can't you can't knock that but all these other guys do too right right no and so we've gotten together and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals and it's really really kind of a neat thing to do you can how often do you meet well we try i mean because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that it's like you know if we can do it once every six months we are doing well yeah so i mean we originally started out you know when we were younger and didn't have so much stuff going on with the kids oh yes yes uh-huh um then we would we tried to do it every other month but lately it's just been once every six months yeah oh well that's much more reasonable i was involved in a a club like that for um that you know where we tried to really do gourmet uh meals and uh we yeah we were a little bit too frequent i think i don't remember if we were once a month or anyway it was oh it was difficult by the time we went around it was uh four couples so uh by the time we got around uh to each of us and it was time again we were almost tired you know really really um partly because um gourmet cooking is not particularly conducive for regular dining it's too rich oh it is absolutely and so i we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day yeah um so uh we we kind of and then one of the couples uh moved and so we sort of didn't didn't continue it but um and i must admit that as you say when your children start taking up your time then you you don't have as much time for uh regular entertaining but um when when we entertain i usually try to find something that would be um kind of good for everybody and that that sometimes means you can't do gourmet right because depending on who your guests are oh yeah well yeah that's true and we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish so mean and she can get with in oh yeah well one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all oh my uh so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese uh well i take that back uh she can't eat some cream cheese but that that really limits um oh yeah yeah it sure did it makes you uh keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out for something like right so we we try to keep all that in mind but otherwise um i guess you know entertaining um oh yeah right i i guess i have recipes i um but that's that's basically what we do is the gourmet so you know they would be pretty elaborate um-hum yeah um but it's fun i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff and you know you get all prepared but you're right it's very very rich and i'm glad we don't have it every oh wow yeah because it is it's a quite a treat it really is um yeah sounds wonderful right but so you like food and i just love the the community of food i just think it's neat i just love sharing meals and oh sure i do too yeah right and um and whatever you can do you know to do that i don't think you have to be you know more than hamburgers and hot dogs out in the backyard and the and the coleslaw and potato salad but but right right sure well my um daughter is graduating uh Sunday and so we're having a uh few ah people in Sunday afternoon and i did a cop out on to it i'm buying cold cuts well i have to make a cake and i have to make hors d'oeuvres and i have to make dessert so i figured for the main thing it's going to be sandwiches but you providing so right right there you go uh so oh i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on but i can't do it you know working full-time and it's just too much i know we're all not built like uh what what the oh those people that try to do everything Martha Stewart you know we all aren't Martha Stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and and time to you know shoot yeah yeah wouldn't that be nice shoot a video of the whole thing i don't know but it's it's really kind of a neat thing i get a kick out of it i i really do everything all parts of the food i mean i love to make things from scratch you know making breads and yeah right um-hum yeah and you know people really pretty much appreciate it and oh they do it it's very difficult to purchase um items that are as good as what you can make yourself oh i think so um in spite of uh or if you if you do buy it it's extremely expensive in fact uh i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase purchase them cold cuts and i i bought turkey and pastrami and and barbecued ham at a an Amish market near here and i've never been there before and i found that there's uh individual vendors and the foods are wonderful and one of the uh the um vendors had oh oh cakes all sorts of wonderful cakes uh they fresh strawberry strawberry cheesecake now and and so on and it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake oh um which is really not such a bad price i decided i i i just couldn't quite make myself um buy it because i do make cheesecake and somehow there you go i didn't want to do that because it but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful and they they had black forest cherry cake and all those things that are but those are homemade they are not um oh my commercial bakery made and in that they are made in their homes um so it it's kind of interesting um it's out there if you want to pay the price but oh it is i mean we have bakeries around here that you know you you just gain weight going by the door you know just like that really but i don't know i guess some of the best things i've ever had um right just smelling the air yeah i some of them were just hors d'oeuvres you know doing little hors d'oeuvre things that um-hum i have a kick making that i mean you know i get off on strange little details of food i guess but um yeah yeah gee we have so much going on here because you know this is Dallas this is the southwest this is you know chips and Picante sauce and anything hot you know you can always make it hotter and and lots of stuff like that you know so that's um um-hum right really good party time eating all that hot food and yeah and they just love it you know down here it just just you know all the we like hot food too so stuff that goes with that so oh i'm not thank you for noticing i'm from Chicago and how i got really and well how i got to right you don't sound like you're from Texas originally though i thought i thought that there was a slight difference in accent right Texas by way of Virginia i'm and everything is a long story but yeah oh that did um do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy or is it always complicated well absolutely i in fact it just came to mind um and this  okay what do you cook well i have dinner parties quite often and so we we really i really enjoy cooking um oh really i like desserts and uh main dishes i'm a chocoholic oh definitely oh yeah well see i consider baking different than cooking though yeah i can i can bake do you yeah yeah well you know the best recipes that i have come from Southern Living oh yeah um do you get that magazine no but my mother-in-law tells me and gets it and just loves to get the recipes oh it's wonderful you know i've never had a recipe fail that i've gotten out of Southern Living and i've had dinner guests come over for dinner and you know say i don't know what this is going to taste like i got it out of Southern Living it's a brand new recipe and i've never tried it before and and i've never had them fail wow that's great yeah my mother used to like pick out a magazine and show us the pictures and say okay this is what we're going to have and we're like oh God no yeah right i well well that's what i do too and it has a it's been wonderful right yeah she did really good she did really well but i mean like her four basic food groups were kind of like mine they're frozen canned boxed and take home and i'm i'm a very picky eater so that's another part of my problem when i look at a recipe there's ingredients that i don't like or won't taste and so it's kind of difficult uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah where you from originally i'm from Oklahoma and then i've been in Texas for a long time but uh Oklahoma uh-huh so you've had you you know Tex-Mex and that kind of thing i oh yeah definitely now see i love stuff like that but and a lot of it i will eat but there's ingredients sometimes that i'm just like i don't even know what that is yeah yeah yeah well i had never had chili in my whole life until i moved down to Texas and i had Connecticut and i had never even tasted chili and i moved down here and where are you from oh wow it's hysterical because my kids have to have a refried bean fix at least once a week you know and it's like a week has gone by and we haven't had oh yeah fajitas or or something and and i just laugh and laugh my family would die if they knew all these things my kids were eating oh yeah how funny that is funny that is funny yeah we've always always had southern foods but uh mother my mother is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and stuff and i couldn't do that oh really no no no i don't think i would i would care for that but you know what i recently discovered there's something um at the grocery store it's called Cajun Magic no oh really and it's like in the gourmet section of the grocery store it's on the bottom shelf and and it's um uh-huh um uh like red beans and rice with all the spices already in it and all you have to do is add water and and cook it and it is so good ooh that does sound good it is good it is good and it's called Cajun Magic and i'm sure you could probably you know i buy i buy it at Albertson's okay i'll have to look for that yeah and um that's wonderful huh and it's in the gourmet section well you know where they have those kind of hard to find items you know the the real funny mustards and and that spices and things like that and that's that's where they have it at Albertson's and it's really good i like yeah yeah huh so your kids aren't picky eaters easy i have a daughter who will eat everything and a son who will eat nothing so as a matter of fact she's babysitting tonight and she called and she said oh mom they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger Helper and it's delicious how funny and i laughed well that's what when i got married um both my husband and i had been living separately so my girlfriend wanted to give me uh a wine shower where people brought recipes what a neat idea yeah it was really neat because they brought the bottle of wine and then they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine oh how nice and one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had written down the number to Domino's Pizza i love it i love it when i worked one time we had a thing where we had uh uh luncheon and everybody had to bring a dish and somebody oh yeah gave directions to a to a bakery you know turn left on Campbell Road and right on you know and that was cute that was cute yeah well desserts are definitely a weakness but uh oh i love them and i'm definitely a chocoholic but i found something it's a white chocolate mousse cake do you like desserts oh that is just heaven is it wonderful yeah but i wouldn't even know how to begin to make it oh oh but i need to definitely find the recipe and at least attempt it because it it's so good oh i would love that i i like yeah i'm not crazy about sweets but i really have a passion for cakes any kind of cake i i really like chocolate cake and um apple cake um yeah ooh i've never had apple cake love apple cake oh i love apple cake or spice cake something like that yeah yeah i really like that yeah yeah especially in the morning that's really good then um-hum yeah it is yeah it is um well i'm getting hungry now and i just got done with dinner so um we had beef ribs and a potato casserole and a salad yeah i do i well oh really what did you fix um God you really are a cook you know it was so funny when i was when i was reading the things and they said you know checkoff different categories that you could talk about i thought food i could talk about food have you not eaten yet tonight well i i did i went to the doctor the other day and my cholesterol is really high and so he's putting me on a special diet on Tuesday and that's what when the category came up tonight i thought oh God i'm so glad this is tonight and not next week because oh oh um he's putting me on a liquid protein diet and so oh really was your was your cholesterol that high it was two forty and i'm only twenty nine years old hum so he said let's bring that down so he's putting me on some liquid protein and i'm not doing to be able to eat for two weeks really yeah so really wow yeah i kept telling my husband while a go is two forty really that high though it is for for me and my age bracket yeah yeah um so i think it's supposed to be one eighty and he thought two forty was a little bit high for me you know what i just recently got um a cookbook it's it's the oh what's the name of it uh Love Your Heart oh really cookbook it's a low cholesterol cookbook and then i got the American Heart Association cookbook now this is not Southern Living huh yeah yeah lots of yogurt and stuff like that but if you go to like the Bookstop do you have one of those in Carrollton yeah uh-huh yeah um they have lots and lots of of uh cookbooks with low cholesterol recipes huh yeah and uh i every once in a while i get real ambitious and i think okay i'm going to do all this wonderful stuff and then that lasts for about a week and then i'm like give me the blue cheese dressing yeah i want a burrito yeah yeah give me some more refried beans have you have you tried well it's like like Oprah Winfrey says every once in a while you've just got to have ribs oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah have you tried the the no fat no cholesterol dressings like the Kraft yeah i i've tried them the Italian is the Italian is not bad well see that that's part of my problem though it goes back to being such a picky eater the only one i like is Ranch which is like the worst as far as cholesterol goes so oh yeah and does it take have you tried that is it terrible um i haven't tried the new ones that Heart Smart or not heartwise or heart yeah i haven't tried the the newest one yet so what i've been trying to do is just cutback because i just recently even started eating dressing and the only one i like like i said is Ranch  here we go Jay all right uh can you give me your ideas on uh what you think about the budget well on the budget i'm not for sure i wouldn't um start off first of all by putting a limit on the members of congress and then maybe we could get some new people in there to work on it but other than the budget i think they just have to uh i don't know i think they have to just have uh maybe um uh almost a like a constitutional convention and get sharp people from all over the country to come together try to decide what we're going to cut i think we cut the wrong areas and and just maybe start all over again almost like family sometimes i have to do this call time out and then yeah i guess some of the states had had started started out like uh California i think i think they had is it proposition two and a half they had out there um-hum yeah and Massachusetts had the same type of of uh legislation you know they only can raise taxes so much there there's a cap on it right um see down here in Texas they just they don't state they we don't have a state income tax and so they never want to raise taxes so they just raise the fees they just call them fees and there's a fee for everything you don't have a state income tax we don't have a state income tax and uh there's no uh the sales tax isn't on food is that right or anything like that so we yeah our sales tax isn't either uh it's a yeah so we're not taxed very much uh but the fees are pretty pretty ridiculous but i think we just may need to have uh you know get sharp people from all over the country into some sort of a like a constitutional convention and then to say what's working in one place why wouldn't it work someplace else i noticed Bridgeport Connecticut's declared bankruptcy yeah isn't that something uh yeah it was just in the paper the last day or two yeah yeah so yeah and it happened i think Michigan way back in the late sixties when Soapie Williams was governor they declared bankruptcy the whole state of Michigan so it's yeah it's just they're just running um i i don't know about about Texas but i know up around here as soon as uh like Massachusetts well Rhode Island too it doesn't make any difference which state when things get tight they always threaten they're going to cut uh police fire uh they're going to layoff teachers but they um-hum right it's the rank and file they never talk about cutting at the top you know the administrators and the assistant to the assistant to the assistant oh absolutely absolutely absolutely and i think the federal government is the same way that it's it's just gotten so huge that i don't think anyone has got a handle on it anymore no by leaving there's no yeah yeah by leaving that particular group in there to make the decisions it's not going change huh so somebody has to get it to where that it's just a rank and file citizens around the country and and the and like a that's right that's true yeah like a huge convention you know if they'd send uh so many people from each uh um they could do them they could do them in the state by state and then each state could pick representatives just like they do at uh political conventions um yeah but you'd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so that's probably there should be uh uh a mandatory limit on on how long you can serve like maybe only two terms yeah that's i've always thought that and that's if we you know because some of these old boys have been in there for a thousand years get in get in there forever and then that seniority system and then the yep some creep in there and uh so um yep yeah it's probably going to have to start there and get some new blood in there and then yeah um maybe they can look at it and they can you know each one of them that's in there now have got their own favorite projects and all you know they're they're cronies and um but i don't think you can do anything i don't think they're i think the budget's out of hand until you can get in there and change the administration and i'm talking about right through from top to bottom right i think uh well even at the beginning of the country Alexander Hamilton wanted to put a limit on um the the President was only supposed to serve seven years and they didn't uh they didn't follow through on that but i i've i've thought about a twelve year cap for congressmen and senators and maybe go back to a seven year term for the President sort of you know it so it would run could you hold one second just a second Ray yeah hello yeah that's all right my wife's a psychologist and i thought that might be somebody calling in for her oh i see how are things in Massachusetts after Dukakis then um Massachusetts Massachusetts is in is in terrible terrible shape um-hum they're uh uh they're still talking about uh uh laying laying off a lot of people you know cutting cutting a lot of services um the state is not funding any of the any of the cities and towns so yeah yeah so the cities and towns now are are forced to go out and uh raise capital uh it's it's uh yeah this is Texas is trying it's just a bad situation and it's not only there but Rhode Island is the same it's just isn't there you know it's in the same boat oh that's crazy because Texas uh it looks like it's trying to bounce back a little bit but it's we've still got a ways to go it's uh i teach in a college and i and i'm in a i'm in pretty good shape but some of these uh there's just a lot of people out of work lot of homeless and the budget is just i don't we've got a new governor democratic democratic governor female and uh she's trying to cutback but she has to be so careful and that's the problem is that you if you come in too fast you can't get reelected yeah you know um there's an awful lot of people uh in this country that are idle uh when you say like the homeless and there's the prison population is skyrocketing um-hum yes absolutely uh i think they should probably go back and borrow some of uh Roosevelt's ideas you know uh set up some of these CCC camps like they had way back yes yes but um that you know give people a little uh dignity because i know a lot of these people would like to work they just don't know how uh to go out and get find a job or they're not skilled or or something and it it doesn't take a lot of skill to rake leaves or do some of those things like those that's right they could they could uh they could build roads uh bridges uh uh canals uh there's there's a ton of things they can do we can take in uh they could stop start uh a rapid transit right right uh-huh movement like when they when they first broke into uh uh the interstate highways yeah uh we don't have a rapid transit system in this country though worth a worth a damn no we don't we don't the um we and you mentioned the prison prison population another thing you can do in the budget we've got a lot of people who don't need to be in prison i mean there's some of the lesser crimes anymore probably you don't need to put them away put them in some work program that's true right yep you know a minimum very minimum security and this they've got a job and you you work uh you know work this long some of them may find that they they like it and want to take it permanently then you could just switch them over in another branch of that and pay them um a decent wage you you'd whatever you'd pay them would be a lot better than having them in jail or having them out on the street that's right because i don't know what what it costs per year per inmate it's a it's a lot but if they just if they just like paid them a wage and let them perform something useful yeah  okay well good morning and uh i guess the topic here is going to be hobbies hobbies and if you have any just tell me what they are right well right now the main thing that i've been doing craft wise anyway is uh i make earrings out of paper and buttons and i do sweatshirts and um really yes how about you oh that sounds fascinating um well i'm i'm pretty traditional i've i've been doing um a little bit of quilting and uh made my first quilt ever i mean it's wonderful it's beautiful i don't know if there'll be a second one but the first one is you know hand pieced and hand sewn and it took months upon months to do this anyway um there's that and then uh now i i've developed an interest in watercolor so i'm taking some classes over at Michael's and i'm trying to uh make it look good that sounds really interesting my husband does uh painting he's been doing in acrylics and he wanted to do some things in watercolor i hear that's one of the hardest mediums to work in however i don't know that i just someone gave me some paints for Christmas one year and i said okay i'll try this are you pretty artistic i guess i am i'm i've i've been sort of painting stuff and people say why don't you let me hang that in my room you know so i've got stuff hanging in people's houses that i look at now and i go oh i can do so much better than that so i guess i've you know developed somewhere along the line but um you know it's it's an interesting thing and i really do like it it's real peaceful it's real quiet you know well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be the hardest to stick with because it is so time consuming it is it's amazing the results are incredible have you thought about selling them um no because i can't get beyond making this first quilt i'm afraid if i make another one i'm keeping it the watercolor i can dash off in twenty minutes and that's you know it's finished but um yeah the quilting forget it oh um i would even join a quilting group maybe to help somebody else finish their quilt sort of thing well you know what i've kind of been looking for i sew not as much as i used to but uh i have scraps of fabric and i thought it'd be nice if i could find you know maybe uh in senior citizens home or something to give the pieces to maybe these people could use a little bits of uh you know leftover fabric you're right yeah they love that that would be good really and uh all you have to do is figure out how to get hold of some of these people yeah i yeah i'm finding out that um there there are an awful lot of quilters out there and and it's not just traditional quilting either people you know are using it for making clothes huh they have of they make they call them crazy quilts like the vests or something the vests and things like that and they make whole outfits out of you know scraps of this and that and it's getting to be a real art form what you wear on your back you know maybe you'd like to try it um but i think it's great that we have the availability here to you know um like Michael's and and be able to be trained and and do some things like that so that's a lot of fun i well i was looking into uh i wanted to take a flower arranging class class and i called i think i called Michael's and Zak's both and as it turned out the month that i called they didn't have anything and then i didn't call back oh oh but i think it'd be nice to learn how to arrange silk flowers and uh save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements oh sure oh absolutely and i just i love flowers i you know i got to have flowers around me you know kind of thing um but the button thing now that sounds really interesting you make earrings uh-huh um-hum some of them i'll just uh well years ago when i was sewing quite a bit i found a place that you could buy bags of buttons uh-huh you know assorted buttons and oh sometimes you got ten of a kind sometimes you got one of a kind but anyway i decided when i started making paper earrings maybe i'd branch out a little bit and i got out my button collection and there were a lot of things in there that i could make particularly the metal ones you know i could just put backs on them oh right um i'd have to clip off the uh shanks and all but then some of them after i ran out of that i just started painting them with my uh sweatshirt paints and you know making things to match my outfits oh how clever so i've been having a good time with that right my my sister-in-law up uh in Illinois she was well in a real rural area and she's starting to collect antique buttons and she makes big huge pins out of them and these big wooden buttons are just um you know they're all sort of layered and put together and glued and back and everything but they are just incredible they're so pretty uh-huh well a friend of mine said uh had a pin that was made out of antique buttons and the thing was just gorgeous yeah and it's they're all wooden buttons it's really neat and she says everybody up there wears buttons on their socks oh really yeah they just you know um do some artistic thing with the buttons and i don't know if they hot glue them on or whatever but i guess that hasn't hit in Dallas yet i haven't seen any of that yeah i know well this is this is mid state Illinois i don't know how long it will take if it ever gets here you know but that's what they're doing with buttons down or up there but it's really neat i i uh and and you do the painting on the T-shirts too the sweatshirts uh-huh well that's what we did for Christmas as a matter of fact for all our friends and family we gave them the hand painted sweatshirts and thank goodness my husband helped me with it because i think i had about fourteen to do oh oh there you are and uh i thought i'll i'll either be working on this constantly or i'm never going to have these finished by Christmas but they really did turn out pretty i was really pleased with them what kind of medium do you use on them or do you like glitter and painting scenes and uh i usually use a transfer we've done some southwest things and uh i've done some flowers but i haven't gotten so far as to do oh you know some of the little pin on yeah uh bows and everything it's strictly been painting so far but i'll use um i did use some glitter paint on a Christmas one and some in some of the metallic paints oh well still and you know each time i do one i try something a little bit different um oh well see that's that's really neat that's a great outlet the only problem is i've done so many i don't know when i want to touch another sweatshirt again well Christmas is only six months away now really i the year goes so fast it's an incredible thing well i'm sure we enjoyed talking to you today oh i know i better get started right well thanks for calling and uh i think this is great and keep on with those sweatshirts well it's fun you get other people's ideas on things too really that's true well you too bye-bye now have a good weekend bye-bye  okay i hope you know more about the subject of baseball and where they're going than i do because oh i know a little bit about it i'm not a die hard fan but i i enjoy the i like the Boston Red Sox myself well i of all the sports that there are that there is i like baseball the best however i haven't been to a baseball game in years but i have kept uh my eye on the Rangers uh-huh you know and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point and then they kind of fell on their face well with uh their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately so correct right they've got a one man show going there which is interesting you know um right oh it's amazing i guess he can i guess he can really call down a salary they're so astronomical i can't even imagine that kind of money you know it's just uh phenomenal right well fortunately the Red Sox last time i saw the paper earlier this week were in first place and doing quite well um i well good been really busy at work this past week and normally on my way into work i'll pick up a newspaper and uh it so every day i'll have a newspaper at work and when i take a break i'll look at the newspaper but this week i've been so busy i didn't even bother to stop i understand i understand but hopefully hopefully next week i'll get back to my normal routine okay uh you are involved with TI's uh speech um but recognition well not really i um i how did you find out about it i work at laboratory from uh i'm an officer in the Air Force and uh oh okay i see interesting they have a speech lab across the hall from us oh great and uh the speech laboratory does some work with uh TI at uh not in my office but uh in my division they do i see um-hum quite a bit of speech work well that's good well that's interesting and the topics are interesting uh they run a whole gamut of of uh subjects and uh i think we can address every topic but the depth of knowledge is quite different sure sure so uh when they chose baseball i mean i'm i'm i can understand baseball you know i don't understand football um you know uh it's such a rugged game that it uh uh-huh uh it seems to be too physical for my uh interest oh i prefer to i i i like i never used to really like watching football that much but more and more these days i'm i i'll like a football game but i've always liked baseball i i prefer to watch um-hum um i guess i'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football and i i'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game well i i can relate to baseball because i used to play baseball but i can't relate to football because i've never played football and and don't and have have any interest and i said if i ever had a son he would not play football uh-huh and uh i had four daughters so that wasn't a question but now i have a grandson that is you know is gung ho for um football um-hum and uh that doesn't please grandma too much well i'm always afraid because the injuries are so uh can be very very devastating well there's injuries in a lot of sport i understand that but i think they they happen more in football i think the odds are cut down you know i i know they can get hurt in baseball too i i um-hum the bat is a very heavy object can do a lot of damage but uh i think that they have a a lower ratio of injuries ratio of injuries in baseball oh baseball that's true i i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less troublesome sports but uh for some people it's just uh because the yeah uh a love for them well that that not so much that but uh even in baseball you can like when i played baseball when i was uh growing up i had trouble uh uh just throwing the ball because my i was very i was always very strong and i could throw when i was young i could throw harder than my uh like ligaments and all that should have been allowed to and so i was always throwing my arm out and uh um-hum i see uh-huh having trouble i and i was a catcher so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and and that kind of stuff so i um-hum that was always a problem for me was just just the constant throwing so did you did you sustain any permanent uh injury with that no i did that wrestling oh oh okay no i'd well i i uh i always been quite an athlete and doing different things and um the other thing was i'd never really let injuries stop me but interestingly enough you mentioned football is like now i won't play football anymore because of the uh because i separate a shoulder wrestling so um-hum um-hum um but i stood the stood the injury wrestling but it as long as i let it heal it never really bothered me then playing football this fall um-hum i it was just flag football too i separated it again and it seemed to be like the straw that broke the camels back so oh boy um um-hum well i have uh i have a broken arm that i had since i was three it was never set right um-hum and uh uh i liked bowling as a as a kind of a relaxing sport and uh one of the men that was in our league in on our league uh noticed uh you know uh my broken arm and the way my ball would do and he says let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage and so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen i had my high game of two eighty seven my God so uh yeah uh it was really funny you know that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and and how to uh keep uh follow through with my uh addressing that to put the ball the uh pins um-hum so that was interesting so i really um i got a lot of uh recognition from the uh uh the bowling league i guess i'm not sure where all my pins came from but but it's but that was quite awhile ago but i and i never pursued it and a lot of people said well you should have turned pro and i thought nah not um hum-um i don't um-hum my love wasn't there for the game i liked to as a as a method of uh entertainment and i uh fellowship but uh outside of that no i didn't and i and i still i like to bowl but uh sure i don't have um Jack standing behind me to tell me what to do are you uh you on any leagues now no i'm not no no uh at TI they have a sponsor a junior league achievement and uh it's true bowling and i've never uh shared shared that with them i would have to brush up on my bowling before i ev en oh tried to uh win a lot of money for the junior achievement uh organization but that's the only thing that i would you know be allowed to do uh-huh right well my grandmother has been bowling for gosh maybe thirty forty years i don't know a long time and she still she's got to be um-hum um um-hum still carries a good league uh average well no she doesn't  uh our children are both uh basically adults they we've we've got two uh one's twenty one and one's twenty five and they they still live at home um-hum um-hum well that's that's a little unusual for uh for children of that age to have both of them that age at home but uh i guess the activities that uh we have with them are uh pretty few and far between actually the they're both going on their own most of the time um-hum so uh most of our activities are you know just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and um-hum that kind of thing well we have a uh three year old and a one year old uh-huh and uh so we you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know sure it does and uh most of the time with a three year old we're trying to to get him uh well we play usually in the evening when when i get home you know about five o'clock or so until about eight and you know with exception of dinner out in the front or back yard playing like uh tee ball off the you know off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball uh since we just got here here we got a uh a new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him and he really likes riding that around uh-huh oh yeah i so you know i'm trying to supervise him with that and everything and uh playing squirt guns and all that and he really likes that yeah and uh the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything trying to do everything he does yeah is the one year old a boy a girl it's a girl yeah ours is the older one's a girl so and the and the younger one's a boy so um yeah i guess uh what i see is so far as uh the trends uh uh for children uh i don't know what kind of a area Virginia Beach is but course uh Richardson's in the Dallas area um-hum and uh i think uh the big city uh activities for for children now are they're good but there's so much uh potential danger you know that you really have to watch your children so closely now that you you can't let them grow up the way hum-um the way i grew up you know that i i'm from a smaller town in East Texas and i could you know go and do whatever pretty much whatever i wanted to do uh my whole life uh you know i never never had to worry about the bad guys being out there hm oh um-hum and uh you know i find that it's quite a bit different now that uh you know you have to watch your children so closely and uh keep up with them i i feel like uh that it's it's really a sad commentary on uh you know on life in general that uh you know that children can't cannot be allowed to grow up uh you know without um-hum really close supervision well i i agree with that and i seem i seem to feel the same way you know even just when i grew up and everything and and the way it is now your it's a lot of supervision is in is in hand and everything uh the only other thing i have noticed though is that uh it seems that there's been a lot um-hum of or more emphasis emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with and and uh looking you know just start not even not really looking for a school for him but uh like a preschool or something you know where he'd go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something um-hum for for a three year old it's that uh there's a lot of emphasis on on on on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten right and it and it seems like it's a lot more they need they need to know and be able to do than when we are then when i had to go into kindergarten kindergarten yeah and it seems like it's more uh you know i don't know they're expecting more or uh or just uh you know kids just because of the computer age or whatever it just know more but when they get to you know to be five or six or something yeah um i guess looking at uh back at at what our children did compared to what uh you know what i had to go through in school but the uh there is there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum it's a lot more complicated a lot more available of course um-hum but uh there seems seem to be a so much more to learn now that it it really makes it more difficult i would think i would i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself uh you know i just or at least it'd be a lot harder than it was when i went to school uh-huh um-hum one thing is i got a home computer too and uh i play uh with the three year old i play some computer games and stuff with him educational games like you know concentration type game matching things like that and uh he's he really likes it and and uh uh-huh right yeah and i think it's important because i think that uh you know it gives him the interaction with the computer because it sure looks like that's gonna be your you know the big thing for a long time hm yeah i think uh and given given that knowledge and stuff with it and he seems to enjoy it oh and uh of course the one year old hasn't hasn't gotten there yet but uh and the other thing we try to do is uh since the summer's time's here is uh sign him up for and her for uh different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming you know uh or soccer there's a little soccer thing that he's gonna do for a week or so and uh you know where they go for an hour or so right yeah yeah and uh because uh when he was a baby that we did the swimming too and he really liked it so we're gonna do that with our daughter too yeah that uh uh watching the little little boys play soccer is uh is more fun i can't imagine that them having as much fun as the parents had watching them i know well we were just talking about that too and i guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a well kick the ball around for a while and see what happens right yeah disorganized disorganized disorganized play that's uh really really what it was but yeah but uh yeah when ours was a he i guess he was probably five or six you know when he first started playing soccer and uh and it was it was more fun to watch those boys trying to trying to kick the ball up and down the field um-hum um-hum but uh and it i guess that was uh you know it was important uh as much important to the parents as it was to the children that uh you know to get out and watch the kids play so um-hum i guess one of the things that i think about is a you talking about education uh i kind of feel like uh that uh the the school systems in uh particularly in this area the systems are not under enough control the the students have a little too much uh too much leeway excuse me um-hum um and and and and that's kind of contradictory to what i said but you know you the have you have to be under control so much when they're out but when they're in school they they don't have quite quite as much control over them as uh right right as what i would like to have seen uh uh uh i kind of feel like there's there's too much allowed to go on in at at school right um-hum and uh you know it tends to uh to encourage students to not be as you know to not concentrate as much on education you know they're they're there for a good time and you know to to see how little they can get by with um-hum right um-hum well i know a number of people that are in the in the uh school district and down in in uh San Antonio uh and uh it seems like it's a lot of the problem is to you know you always have the lack of funds but it seems to be getting worse and worse and so they don't have the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as as as kids need right and uh you know that's just a problem that who knows how that's gonna that's gonna come out or anything but uh yeah but but uh i i i don't know i think uh you know some of the thing has to do with uh with the civil rights program not that the civil rights program's bad but that there's it carried over into you know individual rights and it you know trickled out uh-huh  well uh if you had to pick a a type of music that you like would you be able to well i could pick country music country music i as i've gotten older i've started listening more to the words of music and to the softer melodies uh uh are you from Texas not originally not originally where you from Georgia Georgia okay well see i'm i'm from Chicago so uh i'm kind of in a different category here uh if you had to pick one what would you choose uh i would probably go with it's tough uh i think i would just stick with the classics only because uh i like music just for music's sake and uh you know i'm from the era where you know we had all the rock and roll i'm forty so i'm you know part of that whole deal and uh that was a real interesting time and you know the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound uh but i think i'd stick back with my Beethoven and my Bach and my Mozart i mean because it's just it will always be there it's classic and i don't have to worry about you know what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time but you know same um and as far as country music is i've never really uh listened to it i mean because that's just it was it wasn't part of what i knew so there you go well i understand what you're saying i think if you would listen to it a little you would discover that it has a lot of roots from the both from the classics and from some of the rock and roll of the era that that we both lived through right yeah i it's it's a different perspective on everything too i i know well whenever they talk about uh uh country music it's about it seems sad to me it's always about some guy losing some girl and then you know playing the guitar and singing about it well there's some joy in it also but mostly it it just tells a story about life yeah well i must say though uh i listen to Amy Grant do you consider her country i don't know i'm not all that familiar with her work uh uh let's see well name some people that are country that i should listen to that would be good well i kind of like uh i like groups like the Statler Brothers okay and the Judds certainly oh okay i i must admit that's yeah they're fantastic so uh Reba McIntire is a little uh too country for me she's something though she's got so much energy the that's true let's see well i guess i i have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that uh Dolly Parton she's kind of is she kind of country oh yes that's certainly where her roots are kind of right down there um uh how about the Oak Ridge Boys very much so very much okay well i like them too so i guess i've had a smattering and i just uh you know picked i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north you know that's true you know so well i think there's music all around anyway i mean i think life is just music so you know you can hear it wherever you want and uh and i've i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like so well it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a a record of the rap songs of the eighties yeah the greatest hits right yeah yeah yeah so i mean it it it'll if it stands the test of time we'll see that's true and uh then it'll if it survives then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of hey listen what we listened to can you believe this sort of thing but yeah uh you know i i think of i get real tickled when i listen to some of the old Beatle uh music you know the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still and and uh you know all these rocks rock stations call it classic soft rock you know but we used to listen to it full blast right of course yeah so it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff but i don't know well you got any more well the big key is that i think you've already stated that all music is rooted in the classics and it has grown from there well that's well listen i have to run i hate to cut this short okeydoke well it was great yeah and we'll uh listen to some more music and uh i'll look at some country all right you bet okay bye-bye bye-bye  how do you feel about uh drug testing Bob well i guess uh i really don't have a lot of contact with uh with the business world i'm self employed work in a one person office okay and so my my my my contacts with the with the drug testing possibilities are pretty limited uh um how do you feel about people that are subjected to having to have the drug testing done well i i i you know i understand why companies can in some cases would feel a need uh i have some reservations about it because i i do believe that i believe in individual rights um-hum and and i think that uh that that does at least borderline on an invasion of privacy or you know or violation of you know personal rights oh uh what recourse do you think a company would have then if they had people using drugs and were jeopardizing the company structure yeah well i guess i'd i'm uh i'm not sure that uh uh you know you'd have to prove somehow show that there's a reason for you know for suspecting that person as you know as being a drug user or you know whatever and i mean you wouldn't uh you wouldn't you're not allowed a company's not allowed anymore to give uh uh what is it uh protection the no the the test uh now i've drawn a blank um you mean uh uh the test to oh the polygraph polygraph test yeah you're not allowed to use polygraph test in pre screening you know for employees anymore uh so you know you don't have any any proof or any way to check on a person as to their honesty um-hum um-hum um-hum uh the only way that you you know the only alternative you have if you suspect suspect a person is uh is stealing from you is to get evidence correct uh to that effect you know and i kind of feel like uh um-hum drug testing should fall into that into that same category or potentially anyway that if you suspect it that you should have some kind of proof not do you not come up with a method to to have the employee furnish the furnish the proof against themselves you know in effect you know that's that's kind of uh um-hum um-hum of defeating some of the purposes i think of the Constitution which you know which says you know you don't have to give self incriminating evidence course we're talking about you know criminal cases in that in that case but i still i think it still fits you know the same uh um-hum right somewhat anyway the the same area i guess uh they feel because drug use is so widespread and there's not any um deviation so to speak between an executive and a lay person as far as drug use goes um-hum and um i feel and just looking at it on the surface um that they wouldn't have much of a choice um in picking somebody uh sometimes drugs don't uh the results of taking drugs don't come out until after something tragic has happened and in order to uh resolve it before it happens that they feel that this is most the most direct way and painless way of uh scanning their uh employees i know that in our company i have not known a woman to have the drug test yet well but of course the men i guess it's more popular and i don't know if this is true if it's more popular between men drug use than it is women because i know there are a lot of women that do use drugs um-hum yeah there's not uh from my from my own personal uh knowledge not experience but knowledge but um-hum um-hum uh there are i would say there are as many women drug users as there are men uh-huh as there are men uh in most you know most of the cases that i know of you know from personal conversations uh i don't know anybody uh in even a random um friendship that uses drugs yeah well i've known people in the in the past that have you know that uh and in in almost all of those cases it was you know husband and wife or boyfriend girlfriend or um-hum um-hum you know that kind of a situation a casual user of drugs or do what a casual user uh yeah pretty much uh right social social users say uh uh-huh just to try and see what it was like and then yeah and and and in in you know in some cases it would be uh a group of friends that you know that i would know about that you know i'm not a drug user i have not ever been and will not ever be but i you know i've known people that have talked about it you know and uh that were experiencing different things um-hum sure um-hum and it was you know it was couples and groups and you know male and female and um-hum you know it was not limited to well i i would be um i don't have any desire to but i would be awfully fearful because of all the uh um illicit drugs that are around and the methods by which they're made right and some of them are very deadly and it's kind of playing Russian Roulette with drugs right yeah so but yeah i i understand the you know the idea i'm i'm all in favor of getting drugs out of the you know out of the the system completely so it um-hum well it doesn't bring anything but chaos yeah right but uh you know i i think that uh i think that the companies that that have started the the the non voluntary drug testing and and Texas Instruments in particular or is you know is one that i know of anyway um-hum um-hum they uh i think they're asking for for the Constitution to be interpreted to say hey you can't do this it's you know it's a violation from my point of view it's a violation of you know of of a person do you think a rule against a certain uh um substance is in violation of their civil rights uh not a rule against it but a a a non voluntary testing for it um-hum is i think that's you know it's it's like you're telling if they're telling a person you don't have any alternative but to uh accept uh accept this test go through this testing i wonder if uh now in their applications when they hire people i know it wasn't in the application that i filled out years ago but if now they um are very up front with saying we are going to test you for drugs and if it's then knowledgeable to the uh applicant well yeah you know in TI's under TI's current policy uh new hire new employees are tested um-hum um-hum and you know so it's it is a part of the you know it's a part of the test a part of the part of the employment employing procedure now is is to test so they know that it's not a right um-hum and and there's there's no problem with you know with pre employment testing that i guess that's a little a little unusual that they can test test for drugs but they can't test for honesty and uh you know so that's uh but that is you know that is a a we live in a in  okay so tell me about China Cry okay okay China Cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh was a native is native Chinese uh uh who was raised by Christian parents and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution um-hum i see although she herself had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other uh Christian uh portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong uh leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were ah killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the Christian movement um-hum so anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well her dad was a doctor and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime and the the China the communist the communist Chinese didn't like this at all you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then right everybody was back to a commonality of one and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother and uh finally uh started picking on her uh-huh and getting her to you know they were starting to uh accuse her of of of uh crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over uh and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had uh married this this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court now i think i'm leaving out a portion she graduated she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers um-hum when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were being a child you know so uh-huh they kept on and on at at her and in the meantime she and her husband uh were expecting expecting were expecting a child their own child and uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months and finally they uh carried her uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad and uh the Lord just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really um-hum you know she's she's one of mine she is not going to die and um the the the soldiers were blinded when they shot hm and she her life was spared and this this frightened the the uh the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp huh well uh and course here's this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around huh well she she put in for going in going to uh and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh and then she put in to go see him and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle uh bureaucracy bureaucracy that they finally let her go huh and of course she had to walk you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that they'd already had um-hum uh to freedom oh and they knew that she wasn't going to come back but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life uh liberalization of China happened and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that um-hum huh interesting story yes it was uh very moving too i uh i don't even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly well it was within oh ninety days oh that recent yeah no i mean it's it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days oh i see what you mean but it wasn't uh they didn't have it in uh too awfully many movie houses but it was it was in the it had large uh uh uh press release um-hum well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago so i'd remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh okay um-hum my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and and uh we ended up going to see Green Card Green Card Green Card and and uh uh-huh he chose it and uh it's got this wonderful French actor who's it was his like his and he's been a star in France and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years but he's never made an American film this was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English oh i see uh-huh and basically he played um a Frenchman who married an American girl uh in a marriage of convenience um-hum so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country right um-hum and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there um-hum because she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the Immigration and national Naturalization Service oh i see uh-huh um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight and and she was a very sophisticated well sophisticated urban New Yorker and he was a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the oh on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was um-hum he'd been working in a restaurant when they met um-hum and uh they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course just a minute um-hum that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and right uh-huh and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he he was so proud of himself for giving examples all the correct answers that that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers uh oh uh-huh so um  okay we can start okay hi hi how many children do you have i have four oh four okay okay well i have two children and uh how many do you have two stepdaughters so we have four altogether too okay okay yeah are you are you running ragged these days well no because mine are all grown oh they are oh so the topic for me i i can only rerate relate now to my grandchildren oh well good impart me some wisdom Catherine i do keep my uh i do take care of my youngest granddaughter uh most every Saturday uh my daughter and her husband work Saturdays my daughter is uh uh doing a schedule of uh twenty four hours on the weekend but she gets paid for forty uh-huh and Dave is uh in supervisory work and he has to work almost every Saturday so uh-huh um how old is your granddaughter she's three oh so she's a little one yeah yeah yeah yes she's she's little she's says how are you doing grandma today oh are you surviving is she oldest your oldest granddaughter child whoa oh no no no no she's my baby oh she's my baby yeah she was a miracle baby oh was she yeah oh oh that's nice now do your other grandchildren live in Dallas the Dallas area do you get to see them how nice what a treat you know being from Plano yeah she really was uh-huh yeah yes they do uh-huh they really do uh-huh you know i know so very few people who have extended family in town i'm real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around because we don't and oh yeah that's really that's really wonderful it is it is and you know just so that they get to know their grandparents but also yeah for help we don't we don't have that luxury but we have lots of friends and and everybody tends to be in the same boat so we trade we trade off a whole lot with friends and you know yeah run here and run there we're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now and we have three playing baseball oh that's marvelous well they keep you hopping i'm sure so they definitely do well i know um that uh one of the ladies i know they are very involved with their little girl and and i think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time uh-huh for um her musical uh talents her sports abilities uh-huh uh-huh and uh i think because she is um the only child that they concentrate uh they would like to have more but that hasn't been um possible uh-huh uh-huh and uh she's tried many uh avenues and yeah so now it's just you know that she's kind of resolved herself that yes this is going to be the only one yeah and she devotes yeah and and they're focusing on all of her uh welfare uh-huh uh-huh yeah well our kids you know um my daughter sings uh sings with Younger Generation i don't know if you've ever heard of them there they're a singing group here in Plano oh okay and they're part of the children uh Plano Children's Civics Civic Chorus um-hum and they're going to Washington DC next December uh to sing for President Bush at the White House at Christmas time isn't that neat yeah so so we have been really up to our eye balls in fund raising and trying to get uh oh how wonderful that's wonderful well that's wonderful yeah it is it is so you know and then she plays softball and my son plays baseball and my stepdaughter plays softball so we we tend to do a lot of running things are very different nowadays than when i grew up and i'm sure when your children grew up you didn't oh they are uh you know i don't remember doing all these things i certainly don't remember my parents no running me here and there and supporting me in all these things but we had more i guess family time alone where we did nothing which was good yeah you're now i think everything everything is doing doing doing out of the house which can be very hectic yeah yeah it can be and and sometimes i uh you know i kind of long for the good old days when we didn't do all these running but on the other hand yeah it wasn't so hectic we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents and we've had a lot of fun with that too um-hum you have to look on that on the uh positive side of that it's just different yes it is it's just a different lifestyle yes yeah it's just very different yeah yeah uh my my uh second grandson is an a cappella and i know what you're talking about when he's involved you know the children are involved in that and he's been he has traveled and they have won awards so i know yes uh-huh and i know where you're coming from and it's it's very nice uh-huh oh really yeah yeah it is very nice i think um uh those type of children um that are involved in things like that their uh goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things well i think so and and i think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team whether the team is your singing group your band your your sports team right going to you know you all have to pull together and uh yes on of a team effort yes to yeah and so i've been real pleased with that too i think they've learned some real good life skills um you know being involved in all those things and uh yeah that's that's wonderful that's really is nice to have in your background that you know then you can you're you can be very flexible um-hum and um there's less uh friction involved in relationships when you add that skill uh-huh of teamwork and uh uh-huh i mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that yes yes and i think it's a step uh a giant step of progress i really do um-hum um-hum so um i give me some wonderful advice Catherine what is the best advice of mothering that you know besides don't sweat the small stuff the best of well uh Cathy i think if you look to the Word of God um-hum oh that's good that's real good advice and uh think on the things that are pure and lovely and uh keep your mind off of negative things um-hum and keep your mind on positive things and and stress that to your children and uh um-hum even if they're even if they're discouraged tell them that that's just a passing moment um-hum and to dwell on those things that are uh not negative and that are positive things things in their life and i think you'll see a lot of growth in uh uh-huh in their ability to uh control their thought pattern and and when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God absolutely well i would agree with that we're also real active in our church and my kids do an awful lot with that Allyson sings in the choir i told her that's a gift from God and you need to return that back oh absolutely that's right and you owe you owe that back to God because he's given you that ability and that talent and and that's real nice i i'm real proud of her i'm equally proud of her when i see her in church as i am when i see her performing you know that's that's real neat um-hum right well if she looks yeah if she looks at it as you suggest that that that's that she can give her her her talent back to the Lord for His glory and she can look at it that way and and uh that's beautiful uh-huh but there's nothing stronger than the Word of God  well we uh taxes everyone thinks taxes are too high i'm sure but uh i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases what do you think uh yeah i i think so i i uh i i think i'm i think i'm uh a little out of the ordinary in that that i i uh i think i'm more worried about the deficit the national deficit than than uh a lot of other people are and think that we need to we need to either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh at this stage it's hard to tell and uh i know i'm a real a real uh out of it in terms of taxes so i'm not i'm uh think that the we really ought to seriously consider what an income tax might do that yes uh for Texas and and well at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because like the the property taxes on the homes have reached the point that it's precluding people from being able to own a home yeah i think so because of the cost of the taxes on them i know i live in Richardson and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house yeah yeah yeah yeah but now we're getting public services the schools the hospitals and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there uh look what the schools could cost you yeah yeah yeah now i'm uh uh oh i we'd when we moved to Richardson Richardson one of the reasons we chose it was for the uh for the schools and and realizing that that that quality of schools might well have higher taxes than other places but that we were willing to uh to go for that because we supported the yeah then again the the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent and the public colleges also the tuition has got to be among the lowest in the country yeah yeah uh one of the uh i believe i don't know which one it is uh down there whether it's Hobby or uh the other ex-governor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition well if you double the tuition it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states yeah i think that's right yeah that would provide uh possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things see the so called sin taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount but yeah i pay eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even i i don't i don't know about that i yeah well i quit ten years ago so i i see okay no uh i couldn't afford to start again yeah well that that that would be true that would be true but i know uh my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think huh but all the various taxing authorities that come through i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for DART which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime yeah and and even if it is isn't going to uh uh provide you with any any services in that it's not doing to provide a route from your your home to a business for instance you know well this this is a thing i think it's like uh back east you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it if we had been like a Chicago or a New York City or Philadelphia or someone like that yeah and had a public transportation system starting in the horse and buggy days and when land was cheap and uh construction costs were cheap you could afford it but now digging tunnels under Central Expressway and things like that becomes cost prohibitive yeah and yeah and the other thing is that when it when it's the public transportation is established that early on then then the business uh business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that whereas in in uh in Dallas here we've we've got uh absolutely those patterns were well established before before we really tried to tried to do the DART and uh for instance all the all the the uh office buildings and stuff that are out here in in uh north Dallas as opposed to downtown uh to try to to try to provide efficient transportation from everywhere around the the metroplex to to uh both those centers of of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area yeah you know like New York does yeah yeah just take like in Chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere new York and some people don't even own a car and know how to drive a car yeah yeah right right someone made the analogy uh with Texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street well most Texans will jump in their car to drive across the street yeah and i'm just as guilty as anyone else oh yeah yeah i drive to work every day by myself uh without even even any thought of car pooling yeah right and uh most people are that way yep because they're used to not having public transportation yeah so but i here again i think the thing i resented where they were collecting the sales tax for five years before they turned a spade of dirt yeah yeah so and doing all these studies and the things we saw about them traveling to San Francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something i felt that was a little uh wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying a little bit much oh yeah yep you know yep we could well that's about all i can say at this time yeah i think i think so i think that will probably do it so okay it's been real nice talking with you good enough bye bye  so what movies have you seen lately well i saw um lately i've seen Soap Dish which was a uh that was a lot of fun it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things ah well see that's something i want to see that's on my list to see yeah yeah it was it was okay it was not um not a wonderful film but it was i mean it was it was cute but not the biggest laugh i've seen oh okay i saw Thelma and Louise oh did you a couple of days ago and really liked that actually i saw it twice because i liked it so much oh see that's also on my list and it's very it's really disturbing but a good movie a disturbing movie how do you mean well it was um let's see the um it's it's different it's kind of it's an action adventure kind of you know shoot them up kind of film but it's with women in it instead of men so that's kind of a right a switcheroo huh that's kind of a twist on the normal thing And it made me think a lot about you know you would applaud Bruce Willis in Die Hard if he was doing this but you might not be so right you know so encouraging of Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis when they do it when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it so that was kind of interesting i've but i really enjoyed it oh so that was because that that just reminds me of you know like back in school and you know the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble but um yeah yeah that's kind of what it was right they had started out with that then they got into lots of trouble before we found the shopping malls that's what we did yeah well um i'll have to put that i'll have to keep that on my list then uh-huh yeah i also saw that Madonna movie oh Truth and Dare and that was pretty scandalous scandalous yeah it was kind of yeah Madonna i can imagine she's pretty trashy so it was it was interesting i guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is huh right well i think she kept saying that uh they talked about her it it was a film of her concert um tour she had taken through all all around the world and they were all to her at the Vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in Rome and hm kept saying that her show was not garbage it had a social message to it and you just had to find it you had to wade through it and find it right we never quite believed that so you never quite got to i thought that was pushing it a little bit but she all i know about that woman is that she's an in incredible marketeer yeah she's rich yeah and she's rich and she you know so she's smart at what she does she knows how to do that she knows how to twist this around huh yeah so what did you think about Dances With Wolves well okay see we're getting back to last year that's probably the last movie i saw um Dances With Wolves i just adored it really how can i tell you um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i i've read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and so you know just um-hum the general theme of the whole movie was um pretty i mean i really liked it a lot i mean it was a real consciousness raiser i guess right um and i only bring up Wounded Knee because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the American pop Indian population and then everything went away for a couple years and now it's back again and you know it's right um-hum sort of a popular view of um what happened way back then of course no one will ever know really i don't know right i know i was i wondered if uh the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the the evil tribe if they were really as bad as they made them to be well who knows i mean it it it sort of showed like two different types of tribes like one was a warring tribe and the other one was uh vegetarian kind of you know feel good tribe you know sort of thing so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world nobody can get along peacefully right um-hum yeah but i wonder i thought the because they made a big deal about how this this film was such a big leap for the the people who who were the ancestors of these this Indian tribe and that you know that was so wonderful that they done that and they uh i i wonder about how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film if it oh i see yeah you know you didn't hear any press about that i thought it was a very interesting movie huh well i think so i um i have come to respect a little bit more the uh you know what went on here but but who knows how it's supposed to all end you know on the on the broad scope i mean right uh-huh right um like i said it it it had a much bigger thing i think meaning to me i think about you know just the meaning of um the freedom of this country and and what that really meant and that was taking over somebody else's freedoms and sort of trampling that and uh so right uh-huh you know it it meant something bigger i think but still it was a fantastic i loved the buffalo scene and and i thought Kevin Costner was just i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes but he's the director you know um but yeah i i just thought it was i know the a really interesting intense film intense i think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast well that's good that was that was it was it was good i looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing but it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood i don't know why yeah we did there were three of us who went we were just all grouchy really grouchy when it was over yeah ate a lot of popcorn did it really huh so we decided that may be the mark of a good film it made us think and so we were grouchy we felt guilty made you think maybe it well maybe that was um but there are no answers you know for being i know and we we had nothing to do with it we were not responsible but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on we could have that that can make you crabby yes really that's true but it it's they sort of candy coated the western story for many years and um you know when the truth right oh well it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story but have you seen any other movies because you sound like you see a lot um-hum yeah well right i do i'm just out of school so i've seen a lot of oh okay i don't have a job so i shouldn't go see movies all th e time um i rented a good movie um called Cinema Paradeso which is an Italian movie oh there you go oh oh which is probably the best movie i've seen ever it was just wonderful it's a uh story about a little boy in a Italian a little Italian village and he um really owns a um or he works in a a movie theater and it it helps the projectionist there's a little oh an old man who's the projectionist and he befriends this old man and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years oh and it's just i mean if you don't mind reading subtitles i thought i had to kind of get beyond that those little you know reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but um oh i just laughed and cried and oh i'll have to write that down i really loved it that was a a great one and other than that i wow have you have did you see Texasville are you into Larry McMurtry no i've had i hadn't i had read um The Last Picture Show and but that's out on video now and i haven't seen it but i was interested in reading Texasville before i saw the movie did you like it yeah um i i read a lot of Larry McMurtry books and Texasville is just like that it's like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar right um-hum things that people do with each other it's it's you know and it's just sort of a  okay so what's it been doing up there it's real dry up here yeah we need rain really bad oh really oh well all the farmers you know well it's good for hay you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything but they're going to need some more you know rain to get the second cut oh i i'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field and if we don't have rain she's going to lose a lot of money oh my goodness well we have been drenched oh we have had so much rain for May and June that we've got all the uh weather people down here really confused oh my uh we it's probably it it's just it's usually dry down there isn't it yeah right now by now it's usually no you know it's quit raining you know by at least a month uh-huh and it's still we're still having April showers for June yeah uh i don't know where where it came from but it's been really we got a lot of uh oh i hope they come this way we're in central Texas and it feels like we live in Houston oh really yeah it's it it you know like it rained today and then it just kind of steamed everything up you know uh it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system but it's uh uh-huh it's hard to plan anything outside just because they show up out of nowhere and then they're gone we've had some with really really high winds that have trashed trees and everything else it's just oh my now see every everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry yeah well i hope you get some of that we've had enough we have had plenty and we're still uh forecast for more yeah yeah really so well gee uh does California is California getting rain then uh i'm not real sure i think a lot of this is coming out of i think what's happening of it's coming out of Canada and it's meeting what's coming out of the Gulf out of the Gulf oh and it's just causing chaos and i mean these are good these are good summer rains you know electrical storms and and all that so it's been yeah it's been uh wet and we've mowed our yard i think uh-huh three or four times in the last two or three weeks i mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing and oh my gosh and one one week it just rained thunderstormed for a day straight and you couldn't get out there you just couldn't get out there by the time you finally got there well your lawn mower wouldn't sink we were you know uh-huh yeah lawn mower broke so oh well see now we need we could use two days straight of rain oh it's really drying up up here well what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car it usually rains if not that night the next day no no i was telling everyone hang your clothes out on the line and it's surely going to rain whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains yeah yeah yeah um uh-huh we've had real hot weather hotter than usual yeah yeah we've you know and uh let me think i got out of school in May in March i was wearing shorts wow i was wearing shorts in March up at college and uh we we what they said is that this area has had its summer weather in the spring hum is what they said what happened huh i guess that means you're going to get a double long summer i hope that oh i don't know but i hope it doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter because you surely wouldn't get no i wouldn't think so i wouldn't not as early as it came i mean your talking September maybe that's a little early still the yeah uh-huh yeah i was wearing shorts in March you know it was nippy but um uh-huh like it was still in the seventies yeah you know high sixties low seventies in March yeah yeah we were there we were in New Jersey last October and it was hotter there than it was here it was just like a heat wave and i was like oh i want to go home uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah we haven't because uh we had we packed to cool off you know brought short sleeve sweaters and everything and we just died it was really hot so but i like it here i wouldn't i wouldn't trade it for snow any day yeah oh my gosh huh really see i like i like the snow but i like to watch it fall and i just like it where it's deep enough you know but not too deep right and i can handle a vacation in it and you know but my husband is from New Jersey and he wouldn't go back either he did all the shoveling and everything else he said it was a pain so really well is it weird at Christmas time without snow no i don't think so well see last year we had snow at Christmas time oh so it really wasn't it was weird because we had snow it's like wow it actually fell on the right day so uh no it's not in fact uh you know we're used to running around in you know Spring clothes in December and so when it throws in a real cool winter we get broken pipes and and all that kind of stuff and because Texas is just just isn't built for you know real cold weather for long periods of time yeah well it's real dry down there you don't have the humidity either do you no not not where we are now in Houston stuff they've got it they've got it where no hair spray works it's so humid at times but here it's it's just about right it's it's pretty dry and not too dry where you know you just it hurts to breathe but we're just about right we're just having this all this rain and uh-huh yeah late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable made it the humidity real high but no i like it well we're right in a good stop because we're yeah muggy huh you know we get over in the over the hundreds in the summer but it's it's not it's a dry heat and it's not really uh-huh as hot and muggy as it would be being over hundred plus ninety degree humidity ninety percent humidity yeah see that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real so you know hundred and the high nineties we have the humidity to go with it so you're like real mucky and you you know your legs stick together just from walking you know so um oh yeah yeah i know what so we like it where we're at if it's not a whole bunch of everything at once type stuff uh-huh yeah so but no it's interesting when it gets really cold here and people forget that they're live in Texas and they don't know how to drive in snow and you know but uh i wouldn't trade it for anything i was born in Texas and i visited other areas and i'm just a sun person i think gotten used to it oh that's good well i don't know well i guess that's really about all yeah weather is not real hard to talk about it doesn't last real long either i thought the weather is the last thing you talk about but in this case it's the only thing to talk about but well Michelle it's great talking to  okay all right well i'll just start by saying that we we spend our time you know having a formal dinner on on the weekend and that's when we try and get together it might be breakfast it might be and we try and talk about yeah things and we try we have dinner every night too but not everybody is always there our daughters are fifteen seventeen and twenty how old are they oh wow and um are they all living at home they are at home um our oldest daughter is going to be a senior at SMU oh wow so she's home for summer school and living at home um right now and we we but we very rarely do things as a whole family yeah well when they were little though you did didn't you yes yes we used to like yeah because they're all close enough in age that you would have had to take them all yeah oh yeah we we used to like to go to oh parades the circus um you know we used to like to take them to the park um we had a we have a swimming pool at our house which we've had since they were very small yeah oh that's nice so we we have many memories of swimming um together in the afternoons you know and by the pool and the girls uh learned to swim when they were real little you know three and yeah and then they had their parties there and all that yes they had their their pool parties um so that was one of the things we did together was the most uh i guess the most often was swim by the swim in the pool that's yeah well see i mean you know since we haven't had our children yet but um the thing that my husband and i do could very easily be incorporated with children because we like to go camping and we like to we have a boat so we go in the boat all the time and so oh that's great if you like to do those two things yeah and so you know those things could children could very easily go you know and just go with the flow very easily yes yes i think you will enjoy that i we never camped and we we aren't we aren't into boating either uh mainly because my husband doesn't like boats that much and he uh oh it's mainly what i you know what he wanted to do and and he's a swimmer he's a golfer yeah so uh did he teach them how to play golf well he has taken them out on the golf course but he hasn't and they've never showed any any any real interest it's got not enough action for for the children you know so um but we we like to um yeah yeah but now you know now next weekend we're taking them to a show we're taking them down to Fair Park to see Chorus Line oh really and that's kind of their reward for a school year successful school year yeah well that's a great one so we're we're doing that well that will be fun but um but i you know as far as having a family it sounds like you've got some good ideas yeah it's how about your families are they close by your immediate your um uh my parents are in Oklahoma and i have my oldest sister lives there with her two kids and these are the only grandchildren at this point so they're getting tons of attention but um they're a lot of fun and um-hum my nephew's in to tee ball and so they spend a lot of time but they're in this little bitty small hole in the road town so you know they have a lot of time that they can spend with their kids um-hum yes that's nice and that's you know that was another question that my husband and i had is that what we have four dogs and we barely have time to play with them four dogs well that's yeah yeah those are my children right now yeah i think that's i think that's a bridge that everybody uses to get used to taking the responsibility of caring for something and then yeah well it was real funny because we were walking out of a store one morning and he turned to me and he said did you feed the kids this morning and i said no didn't you and this lady looked at us like we were child abusers and so we had to explain to her we were talking about our dog that's great yeah that's cute because i know our dog i didn't think he got fed this morning but our our daughter fed him because we have we have two daughters that are away right now they're at a camp oh yeah uh uh not a camp they're on a choir tour that's were they are so they're they're gone so it's just me and our older daughter here this week but um but you will um i i think that's neat that you're going to start a family and and um oh yeah yeah it's and and i know everybody around you your family will be very supportive and very anxious too i'm sure oh yeah they they i i have to tell you that um grandparents are very important to have close by i think and ours were never close by oh i know it really well see mine since like i said my family my my parents started out so late having us my grandparents all but one was already dead even when before i was born so i didn't get to have that but that's interesting i had aunts and uncles that were so close to me that you know replaced grandparents i think in every way um-hum yeah yeah so how old is your little so it's really neat that i can do that now with my niece and nephew well how old are your parents now then um my mother's seventy five and my dad's seventy three yeah yeah well that's exactly how old my parents are so oh really yeah and um but but they are the reversed my dad's seventy five my mom's seventy well actually my mom's seventy two my dad oh well they're a lot of fun now yeah i'm sure i'm sure they are but also it was neat too because um there was so much age difference between my sisters and me that i was kind of like the only child and so mother and i did tons of things together we i mean she didn't drive but she'd load me up on a bus and we'd go across country and just had the best time yes isn't that wonderful yeah it was really neat so we were really close but that's oh you must have such great memories of that oh i do it's really neat yeah because it was real funny because in high school all my friends were fighting with their mothers and i wasn't i was having a ball i mean on spring break that that is so good isn't that that's really interesting yeah on spring break i'd go with mother to the horse races and all my friends would go to Padre Island oh that is great i because that's very that's rare oh yeah it was so much fun yeah because i was the i'm the oldest of four and we had a we have a very close knit family and i i just i am just very blessed oh really yeah but being the oldest i had you know the responsibility of of doing a lot i have two younger brothers and a sister a younger sister so um uh-huh oh well see that's another thing that scares me about having kids because i was the baby so i haven't even really been around kids yes yes well you'll well you have your niece your nephew and to to look at that and and learn from that and you can read lots of good books yeah yeah oh yeah but um but that's real fun so and you're in Carrollton yeah and where what what church do you go to do you uh-huh we're Methodist oh good yeah so are we yeah yeah so yeah we've been in Plano for thirteen years oh really and uh our kids have grown up here and i think i think Plano yeah i think the fact that you have the boating and the camping is a good good thing i think it's hard for parents to find things to do with their kids once the sports aren't there oh yeah yeah well you know anymore like we have we always have the baseball games to go to that the kids are in and the you know tee ball soccer stuff like that but uh after they as they get older it's harder to find things to do together uh-huh yeah yeah well we have all i mean and i both have camped since we were little with our parents and so i think it's very natural and i'm sure that's the way it will be and oh we've already looked in the yeah catalog to to find a little baby ski jacket oh oh that's great well where do you go camping um we go to Lake Whitney a lot which is it's a beautiful lake and then we go to Arkansas oh yeah well i was just down near there i i had to drive to Austin last week and on Thursday last Thursday as a matter of fact my i saw the sign oh really oh yeah and uh i didn't know it was pretty i just i oh it's a very pretty lake well that's good yeah it's it's real clear which is kind of unusual for Texas lakes yeah and they have campgrounds oh yeah they have some great camp grounds and then we like to go to Arkansas too because that's where i camped when i was little and there's some beautiful lakes there yeah yeah yeah well that's interesting i am not timing this conversation because i guess you're supposed to be in control it says so yeah well yeah but i just kind of keep talking until we quit well this is my first call so um yeah yeah i i enjoy uh this is really going to be a neat thing i think oh really yeah yeah i do too but um i it's it's i think i'm going to need a pencil you know to to jot down what they say in the beginning and that because it's hard they're it's like  okay so uh what do you do with your lawn oh i just i just mow the lawn that's about all i ever do uh-huh do you put any fertilizer or anything like that um not really to speak of uh-huh um when i was little we used to use uh like uh chicken manure and cover the whole lawn with it and then uh plant uh Bermuda mostly um-hum and how about uh like landscaping or the you know bushes or flowers or anything um we had monkey grass uh-huh and a wax leaf ligustrums uh-huh and do you like take care of those in anyway as far as uh feeding them or well the freeze it's really it's bad here because the last couple of years the freeze has been real bad uh-huh i had to hack them off a little bit uh-huh and um and it left most of them dead in in a lot of places it they just killed them right off oh did it right right well we have we just moved in and we're uh kind of our yard has been left untended mostly for about six years so there's a lot of clover growing in it and everything um-hum and uh so we're trying to do is kill to to kill back all the weeds and the clover and let so the grass can grow and a number of the bushes uh there's a lot of boxwood bushes and all that were overgrown so we had to trim those all back you know to to nice and round because they were kind of sticking out all over the sidewalk and everything and there was some uh some juniper that was uh absolutely huge covering up half the driveway just about so we had to cut it all back so you can park the two cars in it um-hum and uh mostly what we're doing since we got a yard service to our lawn service to help fertilize uh seed aerate the lawns uh so that uh you know we can get it back up to speed and to and and to get get it all green again and i was gonna watch what i was gonna to do is watch them throughout the year and see what kind of fertilizer they use and uh then i'd just repeat it from then on myself um-hum and uh we're also kind of looking at uh a little bit of landscaping as far as putting some uh azaleas in with uh you know different white azaleas and red azaleas and purple azaleas you know to give a little color into the into the landscape there and uh you know put a couple of plants around our deck in the back and a couple in the front with the existing plants uh to give a little color and everything uh do you do anything like that or um not very much um just um um-hum we had some hanging uh flowers in the on the porch and um um-hum and a few plants on the inside um-hum that was about it you know some of the things that i've seen around here too is that a lot of people uh there's kind of two ways to to that i've seen to cheaply fertilize your yard and one was to uh i guess a big thing around is a called a composter uh-huh you know where you have you heard of that yeah oh yeah whether you you know you put your whatever different grass clippings and all that in and and you let it sit there for a while and it kind of cooks or something as as it decomposes and we sort of have one by guess by accident that's in our backyard and so we're thinking about using some of that to spread around you know the the the bush beds and flower beds and stuff but another thing that uh one of my neighbors is doing and it it his yard looks really good is that he's not using any of the he's not collecting any of the um uh the the uh grass that he mows up at all he just let's it sit right back into the grass you know doesn't collect it in a bag or anything um-hum and by doing that i guess it sort of acts like it's own fertilizer right and uh it just makes the grass real thick and and green and everything and it doesn't cost anything yeah they have a they have a mulching blade now it cuts the cuts the grass up real fine and you don't have to you don't you can't even see it when it falls into the grass it it just penetrates right through to the ground oh you mean so that's a separate blade well i don't know exactly what it does but it cuts the grass a lot finer than than uh the old mowers used to do uh-huh uh-huh do you think that that's like uh a blade that you can put on any mower or is it a special lawn mower the whole thing uh it's a special blade i mean they have mulching mowers but then they have a mulching uh mulching attachment too oh really huh that you can put on other mowers oh i'll have to look for that i didn't know it was a separate blade i think i think it's double-edged uh-huh and it cuts it back and forth oh okay oh i'll have to look for that because that that would sure help us yeah i thought it was i thought it was just i don't know something special on the engine too as well or something hm huh have to look for that well is there anything else you'd like to say uh no that's about it okay well it was very nice talking to you nice talking to you okay take care bye-bye good-bye  okay um do you own a PC by the way i'm guessing you probably do i don't have one in my home here my um parents have one and they live just about three miles away so we use that one and my in-laws also have one and they're almost as close they're in Richardson oh i see right uh-huh uh-huh and what kinds of things do you use it for when when you use when you go to their houses houses to uh use them um usually uh word processing something um such as oh forms for things uh also i have a nine year old that i've been home schooling for the last three years yeah oh and we got uh the one that my parents have is an Apple II E and i have a sister-in-law who uh-huh is who works in the Fort Worth school district and so she got me copies of uh several of the Apple programs um-hum great yeah for school programs and so we use those and there's some whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game so oh sure that's part of it um my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things uh his resume uh his uh yeah letter he's been applying for jobs and things so that type of thing uh forms for his photography business and that kind of thing uh-huh um-hum yeah well i tell you once you get used to having them you you get spoiled really quickly um yeah i'm uh my father had a software company and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing here huh uh-huh yeah but um they're kind of old older so i'm not sure that we'll be able to do get too many other programs for it right yeah yeah um i know i'm a a writer by profession and uh when when i was first here in in Dallas or in Plano um and was finally able to this is oh been like fourteen years ago we moved here and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter and i got an IBM Selectric i thought i had died and gone to heaven because i thought oh they're so wonderful well then um oh i have one of those yeah mine's broken at the moment but yeah ours really needs to have some work done on it but but then my husband um worked at TI and i got a um this has been years ago he doesn't work there anymore but he got a um um the the TI Professional and brought that home and i learned WordStar on that and boy once that happened there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length on a typewriter oh yeah i learned i i learned WordStar uh i did some typing for my father when he had the company and so i learned that on there too that was uh-huh yeah have you ever used do you use WordPerfect ever have you ever used WordPerfect or i haven't that's the one that my father well i guess i have used it once or twice uh it's the one that's on my father-in-law's computer he's got an IBM and uh so that's the program that they're using there uh-huh right yeah yeah that's probably where you've used it uh-huh yeah um i have that on my uh computer here and also um i work do some work at UTD and um that's what they have there and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position and and already know the language you know already know the the software and um i don't know from my own experience um WordPerfect just just so much better than than WordStar at least the version of WordStar that i used to have it may be improved by now but that's what i've heard yeah it's uh WordStar was never very intuitive to me i mean you know you some of the commands just had nothing to do with what you know what you were supposed to be doing what they what they did on the computer computer but uh i mean like going um uh-huh forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just you know didn't match with the kinds of keys you were using yeah you had to memorize it and yeah and but WordPerfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways and you and it does a lot of things too that if you if you do any kind of uh research or anything like that where you have to uh use footnotes it is just wonderful because it keeps track of all your footnotes oh oh that's neat and if you add it if you put a footnote in in the middle you know if you come up with some new piece of documentation and you put that in the middle of your paper and have to footnote it you just change um it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you oh how wonderful so you know it's just that i had heard that that was better that was a better one yeah yeah and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper you had to go back and retype everything and uh it was just awful so um i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled but i think it's a nice kind of way to be spoiled so um well i have not really paid much attention to a clock although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes so um yeah yeah i agree if you um unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with PCs not too much what kind of what kind of things do you write well um i was a technical writer for many years um and my husband and i actually met in a computer company um i was a tech writer and he was an engineer and uh so i did tech writing for a number of years oh go talk to daddy about it oh sure excuse me go on and talk to daddy about it tell daddy i unplugged it for you but you don't need to drag it down the hall got a problem huh um daddy daddy came home and found her playing with the telephone that i had unplugged oh oh trying to figure out what all that was about huh but um i have um that that was the majority of my writing although um i have also done oh freelance magazine writing and some educational writing and yeah um for a while i had a um uh a partnership with a in an advertising agency with another woman who is a an artist so i did some advertising and PR but um hum now i'm actually actually i'm i'm not working anymore i'm a student i'm a graduate student so i'm doing a lot of writing but uh now all of the scholastic scholastic nature so i've done a little a lots of different kinds but yeah i i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers so that's been really great and uh i'm so i'm real spoiled yeah i'm anxious some day to have one here i'm they just talked to the other day other day about yeah setting something up again so hopefully pretty soon we'll at least have the word processing my nine year old i've decided to teach her how to type using the computer so yeah i've uh-huh yeah good that's great yeah well those are skills that she certainly will is going to need early on and you know the and it seems like it's getting earlier and earlier with the children so that's right uh-huh um i think that that would be a real a real uh advantage to to her to have that and uh do it early so uh do you do yeah we've been we've been uh writing a story together and so i and i wanted her to put it into the computer and then print it out and make a book with it you know oh neat yes right oh great and so i decided well if she's going to do that it would be a whole lot easier if she could type so we'll slowly learn to to type here and then then put the story in right that's great well that's a that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life so might as well start now huh yes yes i agree well Nola i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly this is really going to be fun i think and um my husband is a ham radio operator and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the yeah  good morning my name is Jean hi i'm Tina oh where you from Tina i live in Garland Texas oh Garland Texas i'm in Pennsylvania oh my lands you're the farthest person i've ever talked to yeah really do you work for Texas Instruments my husband does yeah probably most people you talk to do huh uh-huh huh most of them do now i don't have anybody that works for TI but uh huh my son works for a computer company the National Institute of some something i don't know what i see well that's neat so i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today yeah i guess you have to push one though okay yeah yes uh-huh you ready okay uh foods like you would plan for a a dinner party or something like that yeah yeah i guess so it may be interesting because probably here in Texas we may eat a little differently than you do up there well i don't know my brother lives down East of us down there and i don't think they ate all that much different oh really uh i think as long as you plan your basic foods course for a dinner party you fancy things up a little bit more yeah that's true uh well uh the thing that i found interesting my husband and i lived up in Washington state for awhile um um-hum and up there of course they ate a lot of sea food and that kind of thing and down here sea food is pretty expensive because you have to ship it a long way to get it oh uh-huh right yeah and it's not as good as if it's fresh it right and and uh and but here we eat a lot of like Mexican foods and um up there there was no no place that we went tasted like real Mexican food to me uh-huh is that right yeah yeah it tasted like they were trying to do the best they could but it just didn't taste right well they probably were trying to do the best they could yeah yeah and uh down here we eat a lot more fried foods i think like chicken fried steak is a real big thing and up there uh it was hardly ever heard of and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh we drink ice tea with every meal and um-hum up there hardly anyone drank ice tea yeah well they do in the summertime i think that tea big in the summertime mostly of course you have warmer weather most of the time really yeah right yeah it never gets real cold so so uh yeah so i yeah but when when we have a dinner party around here i think a lot of the time a Mexican menu is something real popular is that right yeah i know that um i do a lot of planning with our church and a lot of the times when we get together well everybody will bring a Mexican dish or and Italian food is real big too uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh more like covered dishes for those type of dinners uh-huh yeah yeah how about you what is real popular up there well i don't know just about anything oh really yeah we we really uh use most anything i uh i think are like parties and that though are well like we had a dinner party here here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party but basically we tried you know included all the basic uh foods that you are supposed to have in a meal here oh uh-huh your uh bread family and your or least what it used to be the regular menu followed and ham and bake potatoes and uh uh-huh uh-hum uh something from each each area that you're supposed to choose from um-hum and uh we we we ourselves are into the wok cooking you know they been advertising that and we've really been enjoying those uh meals um-hum well that's good they have a lot of vegetable to them and uh they really are very good um-hum right oh yes i i love that kind of cooking my uh unfortunately i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things is he a meat and potato person well all our family is is gone they are out on their own and uh right they uh-huh that probably makes it easier but it it's much different and uh yeah we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese and uh and of course uh-huh uh-huh well my husband didn't like that so we as kids we had five children and we ate that when he he wasn't going to be home for supper that's what we had uh right yeah well that's pretty much what we do if dad's not coming home we have macaroni and cheese or something uh-huh uh-huh but they like uh spaghetti you know that's one meal i can fix and the whole family eats but there are several things that well as a matter of fact i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time because uh yeah yeah yeah oh those always go good yeah the children love them and uh they are real easy to cook and that way whatever meat we have if they don't like it well and my girls don't like beef i don't know yeah yeah oh really well maybe that's good the way way the things are going i guess well yeah it could be because they don't i think it's the texture of it but it takes more chewing and uh-huh right children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers and that and it is easier to chew uh-huh right right so they're not too much into beef and my husband and i eat more beef than we should but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them uh-huh right we don't really have uh you know entertain too much uh-huh i don't know if you do or not but we we don't a whole lot we're more once in a while but mostly family activities yeah well most of the entertaining we do is church associated we have a real tiny little house we don't have room really to have people here but we do get together for what fellowships at our church and uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that and yeah well that's good yeah it is and it's fun to uh i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish um-hum yeah we do a lot of that type thing at church and our homemakers meet at the church also and uh that's what we do mostly most of the time for that yeah uh-huh yeah yeah so you don't really include any certain food groups you just bring what you like right that's right sometimes you have all desserts sometimes you have all vegetables yeah yeah that's truth that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever you uh like best yeah but it doesn't happen very often usually you get a pretty wide variety and you can you can have a pretty good meals from one of those uh-huh yeah yeah i remember one time we had a progressive dinner it's the only time that ever yeah they are oh those are fun uh-huh but the it's the only time that i can remember that i can't remember what food it was i it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with uh several people were supposed to bring you know each like uh a an appetizer and a main dish and a dessert and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers and uh uh-huh uh uh-huh oh but when we came to the main main dish plate there was only like two or three oh is there enough to go around well not really you know we all took real tiny little portions and uh were kind of angry with whoever it was we weren't sure who didn't show up with the food uh-huh uh-huh they were suppose to keep uh yeah that's kind of irresponsible but that what upset you because they are grown adults usually and they know they know better even if they can't do it they can always need to get somebody else that could yes right right either either go ahead and fix your dish or call someone that can i know it right right well that sounds neat i can't uh believe you're so far away but you sound so close they said that we could share we share a recipe but i'm up at my daughter's i don't even have any of my recipes with me uh you know it sounds like you're here in Dallas oh i don't know if i have anything handy we were just about we were getting ready to go swimming and we're waiting on my sister oh oh great Cara hold on just a second as a matter of fact my little one is hollering they're ready to go well i we probably have we talked long enough i'm i yeah i i think it probably has been so i've enjoyed talking to you okay so i'll let you oh same here you have a good day thank you thanks for calling bye-bye uh-huh bye-bye  do you have children uh yes yes i have a daughter yeah she's only about uh uh a little less than two years old do you how old is she uh i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to uh promote a college or anything huh i've got one that's seven and one that's three so we uh we started saving but that's all no yeah so do you is there are you planning to like encourage your children to go to a particular school uh um no uh um no particular school uh i think that's really no such decision that that you are going to let them make that they well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do you know that that's a big influence i think and you know what not only what you can afford but what right uh-huh yeah yeah what's going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are right uh-huh so uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do yeah where did you go to school uh University of Mississippi oh was that local or uh uh well it was well it was in within the state uh-huh but it it wasn't necessarily local it was yeah but i i mean so what's what's the criterion for choosing to go there yeah uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best premed uh curriculum for the uh-huh uh state institutions it was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive at the time we really could not afford it so uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me it uh i enjoyed it so you did you commute everyday then or oh okay no no it was a six hour drive oh okay when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or well well i was uh it it was like another world uh-huh basically it was a no it was a did not get home that often you know and at that age it's uh it's kind of yeah kind of difficult sometimes too yeah especially if you have not been away a lot yeah that that extended so did you go there like straight out of high school yeah uh uh see i did not get my degree until later on so i just finished mine a couple of years ago uh-huh and uh you know i guess you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier but uh that's true yeah that that's like you know when i went on to get my my masters i uh-huh basically was you know it was where i was at the time you know i wasn't gonna right try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled and i was trying to work right right but uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go exactly yeah what which group do you work in in TI um uh the computer science center oh uh where is that at uh north building i see how long do you work for TI uh about three years did you work somewhere else like sounds like you got your masters before here or uh yeah i have uh uh no actually i mean i came straight from school to here so i see so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree uh-huh after your masters or after your after my masters my undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was i see i see so i made career change basically uh-huh i see well let's see i have not you know there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said uh depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so i i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places or yeah well i mean i would like to uh you know the uh i i like the school where i went i mean and i would not hesitate at all to uh to encourage her to go there if she wanted to or the school where i got my masters at which which was a different school and uh right right right i liked it almost as well uh but uh you know that i'm not going to hold them to that just because i went there i you know think that's If they want to that's fine but uh-huh right yeah yeah otherwise not although i can uh would get quite a break on on tuition yeah because they uh allow for uh um because you went there uh tuition uh break for out of state students who um children of alumnae i didn't know that well certain schools do it this school does so uh it's been been interesting i i was involved in some uh yeah uh oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to to trying to get people interested in your school you know and they were this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson and it was and there were a bunch of uh-huh uh-huh kids you know and a bunch of schools there were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids it's kind of interesting to uh-huh uh-huh to to talk up you know your school and i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school and and were interested in it yeah your old school uh-huh um uh you know we uh you you situations like that you don't realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others uh-huh and so i i was real real pleased with that that worked out so well yeah so did you drum up any interest then or i think so i don't know offhand but uh it seemed like there were quite a few well that's good uh-huh kids that were definitely interested in going there so there there was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who who obviously was uh very interested in getting her her daughter in or or and that having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information but she was her her daughter was uh a a majorette majorette drum a majorette or something you know a baton twirler or something and she was she was letting us know she how how uh-huh uh-huh her daughter was she had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughter's uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was oh really uh-huh had these business cards she was passing out and it was quite a production i think some parents go a little bit overboard yeah it sounds like it well you know i think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely yes  the uh Vietnam War was uh certainly expensive not only in in cost but in uh the long term effects as far as lives go uh when i was oh seven or eight years old and just into uh first or second grade or so i was sitting there wondering whether this war would ever stop and whether it'd last another five or six years and i would end up in it and uh i i kept a little bit of an eye on it i had older sisters that wasn't was not worried about going in to it but they had boy friends and the like that were concerned and so it struck home a little bit from that standpoint we didn't have any service people in Vietnam there in the immediate family so uh just the whole idea though of of what we were over there for and uh the very unpopular problems that occurred here the riots and the protests and uh it just didn't seem to go over well with the general public like the last one did uh it it raised it to the forefront of of a lot of our thinking back then so uh i i would tend to say that it was not worth it but then it's easier looking back at at the fact that we virtually lost if you want to call it that it's easy to say well yeah it was not worth it considering the results now had we won and it had been quick uh maybe it would've been different but i don't think so i'm not really all that familiar i never was a Vietnam buff i'm not all that familiar with the beginning of it well my father was my father was in Nam my brother was in Nam yeah you know i had a lot of friends in Nam so it's like it hit it hit pretty close well do you think the reasons are any different than than what they did in the reasons that they did it now and the reasons that they did it then are still the same uh just somebody invaded and they decided to go help huh there is it's it's yeah the only difference is is the people here the people now is going to back there but see they you can't take like they you know they they are acknowledging the Vietnam vets now well but that's not going to work right because they are they were already misused when they came back and they're not going to forget that right so you know and i know my brother won't he spent a lot of time so he came back totally screwed up hum so you know i i blame a lot on Uncle Sam because of the fact you know they had it in your living room and um-hum stuff like that and i don't i didn't like that at all because it makes you worry more yeah and i never thought about that the news coverage might be worse than it you would be better off not knowing i guess in a way it is because then you don't have to really worry that or if you see something and you you think it's your child or you think it's somebody you know and they are dead and then you know you you done went haywire for nothing yeah right so right it's just it's i think the war then was just as useless as it is now hum but you know should i it it's not really useless i guess really Saddam if they were going to do it i think they should have just kept going that's true instead of half doing the job yeah because the people still over there is in trouble yeah it makes you wonder if if they'd had the same mentality in Nam if they'd have been able to to just wipe out the thing you know go all out as it were instead of doing all this political stuff that's half the problem yeah it's too much political politics involved in a war you know they tell you you can't do this but you know what everybody else does not do like the United States people don't listen that's right they say we could not do certain things to them but they could do everything to us right you know and that's what makes it bad the business about not going into Cambodia was that's bad news that's right yeah but they but they did you know so you know it's like uh-huh sure right whatever you say so just blow up any part of the country that they are occupying regardless of the boundaries just like Storming Norman they should've let that man loose yep they should've just let him loose in the city he would have just cleaned house i think he would have done better hum well that's uh so i wonder what the i have not even looked at the cost i wonder if the cost was anywhere comparable as far as what they spent per day or what they spent per month in Nam versus what they spent here it's almost like we moved an entire organization the cities and all all the support team all the everything over there whereas in Nam it was kind of a little at a time but it was so protracted i i guess the average cost of a month was probably less back in Nam than it was this time oh yeah yeah it was plus it was less but still if you take it back then and do the do the do the uh i don't what the what do you call it the average the cost of living there and do it now and do the cost of living it still gonna cost you money it'll cost you about the same cost of living adjusting yeah yeah so i just didn't know how much support they gave them uh they didn't have well like in this one they didn't have a whole lot of USO type stuff to have to put up or build buildings for it was all temporary um-hum but uh there there were bases that had permanent installation as far as entertainment and services went um-hum so i guess that cost a bit and so you know see the ships people don't realize it but the ships and all that stuff that's still over there yeah and then you think about it Vietnam is how old and they still have prisoners of war yeah see i don't think that is right i think the United States should but they put down and go over there and be and just go over there and go through it period you know find out where they are some people know the government knows that's the bad part yeah they certainly shouldn't continue to deal with them as far as monies go no but here we are you know Saddam wouldn't have been so bad if we had not gave him half the stuff he's got yeah there is already talks of you know dealing with them again it won't be long um-hum well he'll be back yeah i guess it's i don't know whether it's better to know what your enemy has or or you know fight against something you know is there or not have let him have anything i think i would rather not let him have anything why give him the same advantage that you have yeah certainly sell him lesser equipment okay yeah but nothing new but he had modern equipment scud launchers i mean let's get real here those are mobile missile launchers yeah they do make a mess and then United States is not going to use them yeah right uh-huh that's true so you know it's like what do you want to do first i mean we certainly made a a mess out of the ar eas that we bombed in the latest war too bad they couldn't do that kind of concentration on uh in Nam um-hum they just were not allowed i mean it took years before they would even allow the bombing that is kind of political i have no other words for it nope there's nothing else that you can do about it it is just you know i think they should've done more than what they did over there and i still think they should've done more what they did over in uh Saudi Arabia um-hum because to me uh the United States went both these places and they made it worse for the people that's there hum that's true that's true so it depends on if you there you can see it if not then you will never know cause in the United States people never know what's going on they just take whatever they get told take whatever they are fed on the news and and go on that's right well i've got mister Carruthers waiting for my attention so i had better let you go mister who John Carruthers from Plano yeah so he's oh tell him hi all right will do okeydokey um bye bye  what was one of the latest ones that you've seen actually oh i guess i think we rented Pretty Women a couple weeks months ago uh right the last two years i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home i've uh um-hum uh become available to come and go more often so i said hey it's worth it i'll just go at the matinee hour and i can see what i please yeah no more costly than renting one the last see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw FX Two and that is a really good movie if you like special effects kind of gory and lots of you know action um-hum uh who's in that one i don't know if i have even heard of that one um do you know that i don't follow performers i don't follow actors some i know some i don't um oh uh-huh yeah and he was the guy the guy that played in it he wasn't the star but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in uh oh the one about the old people Cocoon the Cocoon uh-huh he was a blonde haired heavyset alien oh okay in Cocoon oh okay i don't i don't know what his name is uh i think i know who you are talking about though yeah at any rate i also saw not long ago Once Around that was with Richard Dreyfuss okay and that one was just a very poignant story it it it had people it was it was you know a lot of people said it was a really funny movie but it was a very it was a poignant humor and there was it was like uh uh Steel Magnolias the characters played very well um-hum off one another and there was humor involved but the story was a very dramatic story um-hum and i enjoyed it very much what are some others that you have seen lately oh i'm trying to think uh just the other night on HBO we watched The Hunt For Red Red October again and that's one that oh whoa yeah that's one i can watch over and over and over again yeah i was going to read while it was on but then when it started i just couldn't you know read that was a really good movie it sure was and you know the second time you see it you understand more subtleties in it there are a number of good movies like that yeah there's quite a few uh movies out now that i would like to go see my husband is not a real big movie goer and i guess more than anything that is why we don't go plus by the time you get a babysitter and then pay to go to the movies um-hum um-hum yeah um-hum it just gets pretty expensive right you don't work no i stay at home okay well you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day yeah go during the day that's right yeah that's right there's nothing wrong with that go in the early hours it's a matinee it's not crowded the uh the price is as reasonable as renting a video yeah and that's the way i do it and i go quite frequently if you are going to be planning on doing that now i was Warlock too which is supposed to be the story of a uh witch hunt that is you know magically shot into the present time um-hum um-hum and the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was i was very well persuaded to walk out very well persuaded there was more gore than i was interested in seeing but then the movie settles down to a comfortable action uh i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either but um-hum yeah uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully yeah but uh in the first scene the Warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then ooh bit his tongue out and spit it off in the omelet and i could not handle that i said whoa i'm glad i have not had dinner then uh i saw Awakening that's a wonderful wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro uh Robert Robert De Niro yeah okay i think you said Peter yeah Robert De Niro what did i say Peter i said Robert De Niro and he has done a really good job of characterizing the uh disabled person and of course Robin Williams always just has a um-hum an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing even when he's sad you know you have great faith that he will get happy again um-hum and then oh let's see there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos i guess i can wait another month and they will be videos yeah one is Silence of the Lambs i've heard a lot about that one they say if you really want to be uh you really want some suspense that's the one to see and i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television uh well you know i think i read about that too um-hum and then Thelma and Louise i think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie it's about time for one of those i want to go see that and i'm going to try to get in Dances With Wolves yeah oh you haven't i've heard that is wonderful and um-hum i've heard it's wonderful too but i it's just that they are both very long uh movies and the matinee starts before i get can get away from work and after after that i get involved in other things and don't want to yeah oh yeah yeah don't want to go back yeah i've heard that's we uh we uh rented the other one i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately uh was Presumed Innocent with uh Harrison Ford i guess he's in there and i thought that was really good uh-huh you know i saw that and i really i cannot remember too much about it it was the one where he was a defense uh not defense he was a prosecutor prosecutor and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the the DA's office uh-huh uh-huh and then he ended up being accused of it oh that's right i remember now yeah i remember yeah so i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end when you found out who it was um-hum um-hum well i've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies i think he ought to stay Indiana Jones i realize that he would like his career to develop but i don't want to see him in other things but uh i tell you Sean Connery in the Hunt For Red October i i never did care for him as in the James Bond movies i don't know he was too i was never into those movies either but i yeah i didn't care for the type of movie but he was always slick and greasy and seemed to be conceit ed and had more women than he needed and i didn't like him but he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older i thought yeah i thought he looked real good with a beard too oh yeah yeah he does and there is just a there's a i don't know uh i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning whether he is or not and he he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time yeah and i enjoy those and i enjoy i enjoy some of the Michael J Fox movies i didn't care too much for the last one either it just was not enough to it uh what was the last one i'm trying to think uh the last like Back to the Future then was the last one no no no it was called uh Hard Way where he was an actor trying to portray oh okay trying to be a cop or something yeah trying to portay a policeman and uh that  okay there we go so do you play golf at all okay great yeah i do i'm a player i i'm kind of embarrassed i'm talking to a man cause i'm sure that you are you play a lot more than i do oh really actually i don't no uh i uh when i was younger i played a little bit and i was horrible so i just stopped playing oh well my husband is is a very good golfer he's got like a six handicap wow that is real good so um and he's been playing since we we've been married for twenty two years so i had to start playing because he was you know such an avid golfer so i've been playing now well i have had clubs for for twenty years you know but but i really enjoy it so i i had to check that you know and and uh and uh talk about it well have you played recently wow so you've been playing no actually i don't even know if i checked that or not to be perfectly honest um it seems to have been a mistake i don't know um oh oh that's okay yeah i haven't played in a long time um when i was uh about five or six years ago my dad who plays every now and then took me out with him and and i basically um i had a horrible slice or hook i forget which one it was it wound up tossing the ball into the trees virtually every time yeah yeah yeah the slice goes to the right and the hook goes to the left i think yes i was slicing actually and as it turns out uh i went and took some lessons for a while because i just i would lose so many balls and it uh make it a horrible time for everybody i went and took some lessons and i got a little bit better but i still but then i sort of yeah yeah yeah you know time you know went went back to school and didn't have time and this and that and and the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do and i yeah i think that's really a good thing to do so where are you in your life i mean are you in school oh okay at the University of Rochester oh great and i still have this slice i'm a graduate student yeah yes as a matter of fact um so i don't have time to do much else except for graduate work yeah yeah so i so i hang around this way and uh occasionally uh uh a bunch of us i have some friends who are pretty avid golfers golfers so we'll go out and we'll uh we'll we'll play you know um sure uh-huh and you don't have the time you don't have the length of the playing time that we do no i have i have very little at the moment i have very little playing time when i when i go on vacation my father and i uh play a little bit but i don't you know we play a par a par three nine hole course is because yes oh that's my favorite kind to play because uh for a woman it's really nice to play a yeah my a par three course because that's my i can't hit a driver very far and in fact i don't even like to use a driver i use a three iron off the tee because i have more control over it yeah um uh-huh and i can i can just have better contact with the ball that way so i'm still using a three iron and my husband trying to get me into using a you know like a high number wood instead right but those are uh still not your favorite huh no it's not my favorite but i i uh i enjoy i i really do i think i'm going to like golf the the older i get and the more time i have to play i we have three teenage daughters one oh wow so so you must be very busy one is uh yeah yeah i'm very busy i have a part time job and and during the year i don't play much golf but i'm when i'm we're on vacation i love to play just like you said um and uh we got to play in Monterrey in California uh right you know along the Pacific Ocean this past spring and that was i told my husband that was the way to play you know that was i would if i could play there every time i want it was it was great really a a neat experience miniature golf there's my game uh miniature golf there you go putt putt miniature golf is great yes well that's the thing my kids like to do that with you know on dates and stuff but golf is um we we we probably are talking about golf because i did check it you know uh i don't i don't i don't know i may have actually i may have just checked random things i don't i don't recall anymore well yeah if you ever played i mean i feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it and maybe if you can even talk about it if you've if you've um watched it on TV right yeah we actually we have a very very um we had the uh yeah tell me about your clubs up there what well we had i haven't played around here too much we have a very good one called Locust Hill though there uh the L yes the LPGA comes here every year the Rochester International and then we had a PGA actually a very big PGA uh tour stop here last year Locust Hill uh-huh right oh great and it actually um they say the the i haven't played the course but they say the course is very is is is pretty tough pretty challenging uh-huh and it's um not only that but it's exceedingly well kept apparently because oh yeah those those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros you know they kept saying you know we we hear you know on on television so granted that it is biased but they keep saying it's just wonderful uh the course is so well maintained and you know it it it rained through half the um uh-huh tournament so people had to finish it down and stuff but they still the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about getting things back up again and this actually when when the um oh yeah when the LPGA came here i guess that was about a week and a half ago it was just it it takes over the whole town you know it's all over the news and lots and lots of people take off work uh-huh oh sure yes yeah to go and watch them yeah to go to go and watch the the uh the ladies play so i mean i think it's actually wonderful to see the ladies yeah i'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here i mean people are just crazy golf is just it's just the coming thing i mean a lot of people are just crazy about it yeah it seems to be it seems that a lot of people are really you know either um either you haven't played it yeah or or you you've played it and you sort of stink like me and you sort of play every now and then or you well it's it's just such a difficult thing i mean it's i just i watch my husband and he's he was a professional athlete he he's a very good athlete and he's got the coordination that God given coordination and he just struggles yeah yeah you know all the time to um to master this game yeah well same here i mean i'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time and uh and and i can't and i can't hit a golf ball you know i oh my really yeah because it well i watch my husband swing and his swing you know when i compare to the pros is so it's ridged it's like he's trying so hard it's not that flowing movement you know uh-huh right that's because he's probably doing what i do worrying about is my head straight is my arm right is this correct am i holding correctly stuff like that yeah yeah or if how how far he's going to hit it i think you know and i worry about that you know oh i've just got to get this drive you know really far i've got to hit it a nd then so yeah well that that's interesting yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i have this nasty habit of doing things like either turning my head at the last second or or just keeping my arm wrong yep or yeah turning your head is probably the most common thing for women they say you know you are always so anxious to see where it goes uh-huh is it right ex actly exactly it's just like i i don't watch the ball die i have to it took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before i looked up yeah yeah i have to do that especially even more so with a short iron than a long iron you know than with a driver or something because those short irons it's just you want to look up oh on his driver yeah because you are getting close to the green and you want to hit the green and you know that's why yeah so it depends on where it's going that that is certainly true thank you can i don't know whether i'm supposed to ask questions about i'm not supposed to ask questions about this whole procedure i know that i i well when i that's okay go ahead i it's no big deal do you get get um reimbursed for the calls you make or the calls you talk on too both okay okay well i really didn't know so i was just both i believe so i i i actually don't know i get sort of random reimbursement every now and then and don't really yeah don't really figure it out i mean until afterwards okay because this is only my second day doing it and i just didn't i didn't know and that was the detail yeah we i just started yesterday oh really i've been doing this for awhile actually and it seems like it's been a while and they just i just get these random checks in the mail every now and then and my wife and i both do it as a matter of fact have you oh good yeah i haven't i see i see and we both just sort of get these random checks in the mail and to be honest i i really have not been accounting i just sort of figured well it's going to work you know if it works it works so yeah uh-huh well my uh  there you go first question do you own your house yeah uh right well we try i mean it's a big mortgage in the sky and someday maybe we might even own it but um for all practical purposes i guess we hold the mortgage our name is on the bill so that implies ownership yeah right no one else has offered to pay for it that's right and i wouldn't object if anybody did yeah really they could move right into the spare room yeah well we've we had this one for five years now before that we lived in Garland uh probably about you know four blocks away liked the area chose to stay inside of Spring Park it's a uh uh-huh i don't know if you have been up here but it is a residential homeowners association so there's a lot of you know activities a lot of pluses and common land right yeah but uh we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market you know it could not possibly have gone any lower and so we were wrong oh five years ago yeah yeah i think what it bottom out about a year year later yeah it well i mean just recently i would say i would give it two years back when it was i think bottomed out oddly enough two years you know i i think that but maybe not in your area see it was just different areas not in in in this area because this is about like the that's a really nice area besides it's you know it's not it's not Richardson is it it's still considered Garland yeah no it's it's Richardson it's uh Richardson and hold on a second Paul i can hear you perfectly perfectly well i don't want to hear you you are being rude whatever you ask or scream when i'm on the phone the answer is no do you understand oh okay yeah how does that sound there you go write that one down it sounded good to me yeah there i go yeah yeah well i hate to say how long that will last too no this area up here is uh all custom homes and it's right i i don't think that many by the builder that we that built this house and we were not the first people the first owners i think we are the third owners it was built by the architect for himself uh okay who never moved into it who sold it to a couple who had no idea that homes ever needed upkeep oh no oh yeah caulking windows was a great mystery to them you know you know they just watched the water pour in on the carpet but it's a Sharif Myneer Homes if that means anything it did not really mean anything to me except i liked it oh gee i i i kept thinking of Omar Sharif every time i saw that name somewhere so he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now i think he got out of the lower end market and decided but the houses here in in this class of housing never dropped to below two hundred uh oh wow yeah well but still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine which is nowhere near what we paid for it and i think or somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot heavily wooded off the golf course right oh great yeah and the guy around the corner is being transferred so he said uh well he did comparable that it's about eighty dollars i think it was i don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot off the creek and eighty on the creek or if it was eighty and a hundred i think it was sixty eighty well yeah probably eighty sixty eighty i think well because i know our our little house over here stuck in the middle of you know the subdivision is i think fifty five so i think the high end is definitely you know somewhere around there well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot no it could not be because this house is around thirty four hundred square feet and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars just never yeah well now maybe you know that's that's pretty close to what it would have sold for uh brand new or and that's pretty much what it was built for it's got an awful lot of nice things in it but you know i don't think i think it's going to be a long time if ever when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities are really uh desirable it's seems like people go for square footage only now and uh because have you been back to the Perry Homes back here yeah um the ones that look like brick houses the one that looks like Monopoly apartments right yeah i think those are awful i'm sorry i just don't see the designer's i i just see him as trying to squish as much space you know as much house into the space as possible they are huge when you are inside them they're very spacious they're you know i was i was in one today it was forty two hundred square feet yeah ooh yeah uh-huh well see that's the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i because there's just the two of us and the two cats um can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know see when you have kids you like to be able to send them some place where they can yell and you won't hear them but i have been watching these houses go up and i i yeah that's true don't well somebody was telling me i know somebody who lives back there i've always questioned the quality of construction and i i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house oh when you watch them go up you are just amazed that they do not fall over and it takes them something like thirty days to complete a house yeah oh that's amazing right now in fact even as we speak we are having a deck put on in back and these guys are phenomenal they just they they are doing such a terrific job back there i mean you know you you pay for it too but it's it's like really worth it they are putting in a deck a redwood deck and it's just um-hum they are doing such a fine fine job and i'm really excited about it we've got three different levels of decking because this lot slopes way back down and and the house is built around the trees uh-huh great and with these decking decking that a corporation and a large area for the trees to come up so it's real real shady but that's one of the few things that really uh immediately pays back on return but what i was going to tell you these Perry Homes back there yeah when the people from MCI come down and they are you know they're used to the the Virginia area metropolitan DC my God they come down here and and those houses that that look like to them the colonial look what the oh looks like the George Town Brownstone yeah right and the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars which is probably about what their equity is that they got out of selling their house those things are selling like hot cakes must be a dream come true yeah but one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill per month last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars a month and i thought i can't and he was talking he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here and i was thinking well you know i know why your God damn bill is so high it's because there's not a there's no insulation insulation in those things he has no insulation probably oh my gosh what a trap yeah any yet you know they they show very well uh they show very well unless you have you know lived in a lot of houses around here or and you ask the right questions and can research yeah or looked at a lot of houses around here yeah and i think that makes a big difference but i like i like this area and everything that i've been saying says that it's oh i do too if i think if we had to sell now we could come close to breaking even but still um it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that you're in you're in the  okay well the topic is selecting care for the elderly and i don't have elderly parents yet but not that far in the distant future what about yourself um-hum well my parents are both in their seventies my my mother and stepfather and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies and my um um father and stepmother are not in very good health so this is something that it's a concern of yours right now is yes it is are are they living independently right now yes they are they are oh have have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that not for them my my mother and stepfather have have um set up an arrangement where they have a a large home and uh two of my sisters and and their families one of them husband and then all the children are living in this home its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms and and uh they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen and and um my father bought this uh my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home unless oh that sounds like the ultimate unless unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home well even at that point most care can be given at in the home that sound like just an excellent solution you must feel real good about that um um-hum well i i felt good about it because that's my personal feeling also i um i read a lot and then i know people that then have visited nursing homes and uh have had great grandparents in the nursing homes and it was not a happy situation for for any of them and and uh we have a very active nursing home here in Plano that that has uh activities going all the time and they have uh even the people that are wheelchair bound and and really are are incapacitated um-hum go and uh participate in olympics and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here right you know that so there are a lot of a lot of activities going on all the time and this is a nursing home it's not a senior citizens home so that the people are really uh really in need of a nursing staff right uh-huh right they need the nursing care and and but it's a very expensive solution well it's you know i think we just you you you know listen to is the fact that there are good solutions solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it's just a matter of finding a good home and and then of course there is always the problem of being able to able to afford either of those solutions right right right right and that i think is what is scary and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images um of nursing homes come from is when people have to put people in a nursing homes and they really can not afford the best right and that's right i well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation and uh they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had had uh apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating and uh he had apparently had not been in the home too long just a week or so but when they brought the family came in to see him oh they had not been made aware i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance and i overheard their conversation and when the family walked in his wife and daughter and son-in-law they were not even aware of what had happened oh goodness so i told them he strangled on some chicken and uh they said the the woman the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or oh so you know and i thought what a shame they put him in the home so that he could be cared for right right and then then they could have done that well at home and then she was upset he had on two different shoes one of which was not even his he had on a pair of slacks and the wife said these are not his slacks and she said i just took two pair over yesterday for him oh that clean and you hear these stories all the time right right well i this was just something that i was i witnessed to and and uh at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour you happened right oh and with just a curtain of course between us and and uh right they they revived revived the revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth and he was definitely just by looking at him and the way he acted you could tell he was in need of of nursing home care but the family were all talking about um putting him in another home they said he will not go back well good good i'm glad they have a solution to that one i'm glad they the option to do that yes i know i i would hate to be in a position where that was all i could afford and there weren't there was no choice exactly exactly my um my ex-husband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for oh it must be seven eight years and um oh my it's it's just just her her condition deteriorated deteriorated instantly upon getting into that home as the situation is so um sad because it it just takes all the dignity away from um-hum um-hum from people who have been independent all their lives this was a really neat vital woman and you get in a nursing home and the first thing that happens you have to share your your whole living space with someone that you have never known before in your life right right and oh i i do not know what what the answer is but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there and it i think it does a lot of it goes down to just money that's right and family support uh if you you know have family that uh you can live with right um-hum visits everyday or right right i i really i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care you know you'd do your research and you would go visit visit right and uh hopefully they would have they would have it so that you could go there anytime right because if you could not go there anytime then that would make you a little bit right uh suspicious you know i i my i remember my my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died and i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time but i guess Alzheimer's would come as close as anything she really was not aware of what she was doing um-hum and uh i can i can remember she had several strokes and the nursing home was right next to a hospital and they'd rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days and it was she was it was just like keeping something alive  so what magazines do you subscribe to uh the only one i subscribe to well i did subscribe to two i subscribe to INC at the office um-hum and then i get Cosmopolitan at home oh that's kind of fun yeah it gives me a little variety anyway yeah well that's fun that's kind of fun well we have like every magazine in the world my dad is kind of a chronic magazine subscriber he gets uh oh really oh gosh Bird Watcher Digest and i mean just almost anything any interest he ever has for like a week he will subscribe to the magazine of it wow so we have got every magazine that that there is and then i get uh New Yorker because i like the the literature in it and um yeah uh uh i read Newsweek and US News yeah i like Newsweek yeah they are always real interesting i remember even in high school that was one of our assignments to read Newsweek and i kind of got hooked on it then and then um through college then i kind of had too many other things going on oh yeah yeah i understand when i first got in college my dad set up subscriptions for all these magazines because he could get them at the student cheap rate that we had oh wow tons of magazines that's neat well do you spend a lot of time reading them or do you just pick out what you want i pick pick out what i want usually yeah read uh read those cartoons in the New Yorker read the little synopsis find out who died in Newsweek and look at like celebrity pictures and i'm not yeah the best informed person i guess but uh you know if there is a news name that you don't know you can flip through the Newsweek and try to find who it is yeah that is a little bit helpful but oh that's neat well um i read the INC magazine mainly for my company my company it's not my company personally obviously but uh um-hum we have been selected as INC's top five hundred for the last two years yeah so it's really it's exciting to see your name in print and they do um oh that's great yeah the other things that i read are kind of they are all computer related because that's what my company is about but um right they are not really magazines they are periodicals but i do not know if they would really qualify as magazines i guess so because they have advertising and news print so right are they like PC World or beyond that yeah that stuff and Mainframe Journal and Computer World all that boring stuff but it's stuff you got to keep up with or else you you start falling behind right i know yeah that sounds good and then yeah it's real funny because my husband um gives me trouble still about getting Cosmopolitan and because that's mainly or not mainly but i think he thinks as it uh-huh as more of a single girl's magazine type of thing and i am like well i am going to get this until i start getting like uh Better Homes and Gardens really until you start getting those old magazines that yeah i can't see that Retirement Digest yeah so i said that i'll keep subscribing to a magazine until i started wanting to get Reader's Digest and then at that point if you just cut it off yeah that and Parenthood and really Golf Digest it's yeah really these are the bad signs i can't see any of those so i don't know where i don't what we do with all our magazines we probably you recycle them cut down all all well we do we take them to the library and they sell them there you can not recycle the shiny paper of the magazine oh really yeah yeah so we recycle everything but the paper of the magazines go back to the library and they resell them which i can't imagine who would want like back issue of Newsweek but well i guess maybe there are people in the world all those people doing all that research that's right people can get them and have their children do craft projects cut the pictures out and well when i i was doing some research for a product i was doing at the office and i went to the library and read the magazines on the microfiche which was really pretty neat oh which is bad i don't like those microfiche i i we had this last year of school i had my last paper of college and i am writing this paper on Bette Midler i was decided i was not going to be very academic finally and uh yeah but you had to look through all these old periodicals and use microfiche and i just got seasick the little things zipping by your face so it was oh yeah i just thought i was going to throw up right there in the library it was not a good day well so i guess i went slow enough that it did not make me nauseous yeah well they have like the the automated machines now you just press the button and the oh and it zooms words just go zipping by and oh yeah i do not think i could do with that it it's bad uh but it was really neat cause i was doing this this project i had to read American Demographics which you know i had never even knew that magazine existed but it had some really neat stuff in it right yeah that's um we did a lot of demographic stuff at school huh i was amazed i did not know that kind of magazine was even out there i know it's something you never thought you would care about there is perhaps a magazine for every interest in the world yeah cause even like in the grocery store you know i do not ever go over and look at the magazines but i was getting some pictures developed at the grocery store and it was taking longer so i was hanging out over there and i was amazed at the different kinds um-hum yeah there is it's a lot out there we have Modern Maturity that was the worse mom and dad dad turned fifty so we got Modern Maturity like this is not good it has all these like health tips and ways to fix prunes and oh really oh God what a good magazine oh that would be awful so yeah and so we are i do not know what my parents get i think uh my dad is retired Army so i know that they get something along those lines right but uh and he is real big into genealogy but i don't know if there is any genealogy magazines oh no doubt there is i am sure i'm sure of it really yeah well that is probably true i had not thought about that their's i never knew all the specific things they had in magazines yeah they are fun though i mean at least it kills time while you are at the doctor's office i know really all the try do the word find in Highlight magazine oh yeah i was real surprised though my doctor carries tons of magazines i mean he has like Tennis World and i mean stuff that normally i mean a doctor's usually have US News or World Report and People magazine and that is about it right my doctors have the worst magazines i really have to change doctors but then i might need to get that you want my doctor's name well i mean if you get that many at home you probably would not want them i know um we're not at any loss for reading material here you you pretty much you can read like the table of contents before the next one comes and then yeah i bet you are you're that there is like a big pile these are the magazines we are going to read sometime and so it's yeah your mailman is probably not real happy with y'all huh no i uh no get we have the jumbo truck that comes by our house to drop off the mail oh wow it's a mess but that's okay we keep the publishers magazine publishers in business yeah really in the midst of the recession we're supporting America's publishing economy yeah well that's what a friend of mine um was getting the Wall Street Journal and she wasn't taking the time to read it so she just had this huge pile and we were like what are you doing saving up for a puppy um-hum really line a bunch of bird cages yeah really with that okay well i guess that's about all on magazines nice talking with you have a good evening sorry to interrupt your dinner bye well okay well you too thanks you too that's fine bye-bye  okay ooh uh wow i don't know what that was i don't know what what was that and uh to um the Brazos River near Dinosaur Valley State Park um-hum oh yes uh-huh um the we have not camped in any of those places in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped but we used to go to Tyler State Park and um to Dangerfield and um-hum in Texas that is where we camped basically um what are they like they're very nice Tyler is really really a neat place to camp it has a nice a nice little lake and it has some really wonderful uh sights that are in the the wooded areas um the facilities are quite nice and our children like liked it quite well uh the kids are well they were quite a bit younger then and uh you know it they we felt real um safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area and uh it was just it was a really nice place to to camp um-hum um now Dangerfield is let's see i think that's a little bit more more east further east and maybe south if i am remembering where that is no i think it's a little bit further north when i think about it at any rate it was it was very nice as well but Tyler we sort of got spoiled with i think uh-huh but uh we had lived in Michigan before we came here and um had done a lot of camping in Michigan i think the upper peninsula of Michigan especially and then also we had done some camping in Colorado in the mountains so uh my parents were real avid campers and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally yeah um do you um have a large tent or yeah it was a a nine by twelve uh-huh uh-huh and how how many does that sleep uh comfortably well there well supposedly it it's they always say it sleeps more than it does right but it they it would have slept three adults anyway yeah yeah yeah well sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger uh we invested in some stacking um cots you know that were like bunk bunk beds but they were cots fold up cots that really gave us a lot more space um floor space and um-hum so you didn't have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around and uh gave us a place to stack things during the day so that was real nice right but uh we um my my uh uh in-laws also had a camper um pop up tent tent you know one of those trailer pop ups and those are really nice too and the little more uh luxurious so to speak but not much do do they have a kitchen in them yes uh-huh it's really nice in fact it even have a had a little refrigerator and and the whole business it was quite nice in that respect and yeah yeah uh everything was very convenient and you didn't have to to be hauling things out of your the trunk of you car so that was nice yeah trunk of your car all time right so um do you have plans for for any other camping trips in the near future oh maybe uh maybe back to Caddo or um uh Purdis Creek uh-huh right or uh i like Bob Sandlin too it's a new park uh-huh and there is um not really camping but um what's it called Cedar Hill right by Joe Pool oh yes and sometime i like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma yes yes i've been in that area that's a really pretty state park um um-hum just we didn't camp there but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area and it's just real lovely it's close to the lake and close to the dam i think it's close to the dam up there so it's it's really quite pretty uh are you um let's see what was i was going to ask you something else oh do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to oh from from those three just just uh from when i have been an adult i like Caddo the best yeah uh-huh um is uh is it true that Caddo Lake is the only natural lake in the State of Texas yeah that's right i i would i've never been there and i would love to see what it looks like it's not it's not very deep and they did build a dam on it but it was there before they built the dam it's been there for a hundred years apparently an earth quake caused it uh-huh oh i see how interesting i guess i'd never heard the history of that huh yeah yeah well that might be some place where we my husband and i can go we're talking about starting camping again in the fall um our children are both grown and and so it's just pretty much the two of us who do things and so uh we thought we might take some weekend trips then and maybe that would be a good place to to go to and see what it looks like yeah it's really nice yeah yeah and it i don't know probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas yeah is it uh yeah i think so especially with uh uh when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty especially in east Texas it's really nice so that's right uh-huh well uh i've enjoyed talking with you it's nice talking to you and um have uh uh some happy camping trips hope you get to those places you've talked about yeah you too well okay thanks uh-huh bye bye bye bye  and i guess the suggestion is that we maybe talk about a menu for a dinner party if we wanted to do something like that or share recipes or something um are you one who gives dinner parties very often yes uh-huh sure right no no nor am i uh i avoid them with all they're a lot of work that's for sure yes yes yeah they are i mean i do them but they're a lot of work i usually have them when i there's a special event in their lives and i i make a big deal out of it for them yeah uh-huh uh-huh and uh i think i'm uh most happiest with my most familiar foods that i know are successful yeah right yes you know and i have uh i make my own pies and pie crust and you know i can make my pies from scratch i don't need a recipe to follow and uh-huh oh that's great you sound like my mother who's been well i bake pies too but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same the same technique i mean i guess after so many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature uh yeah you just know from heart i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie and she said make me one and i made her one and when i when she gave me back the plate she said i didn't share this with anybody ah she enjoyed it huh well there's a a woman in our choir who is almost nearly famous for her apple pies and uh we had a and i thought whoa that was a big pie yes um um-hum a an auction one time at the church excuse me and uh one of her pies was auctioned for fifty dollars my word she must have a great pie recipe then well i i think i i i've had it once and it's been a few years ago but i do recall that it was quite good so um wonderful yeah so that is her specialty um i like to bake um also i don't bake so much now that my children are grown but i do enjoy baking and i guess i always liked making making um cookies and bars and things like that that was more my specialty i suppose and they seem to last longer than pies around here pies just would would go practically in a day's time yes um-hum um-hum yeah you that's right yeah they're meant for the that evening dessert and you know it's got to be gone or daddy gets into the you know the leftovers and puts about two more inches on his waistline and then he is chastising himself afterwards right and not very happy huh well it's interesting that uh yesterday i had lunch with a friend and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend for friends of hers for um a um-hum one of her acquaintances one of her old friends i guess had been in town and uh they invited two other couples over and so there were seven of them but uh i said well what did you have and she said what she had uh just Mexican food but you know she had uh uh you know guacamole and uh i can't remember all she had but she also had made uh flan which is actually Spanish i think have you ever made that or had it no i have not huh-uh it's it it it's um i had used to work with a a gentleman who was from Cuba who would make it uh and it's just a wonderful dessert it's like uh a egg custard in a uh caramelized sugar uh was on top of it and it's it's quite um-hum oh okay actually not very difficult to make but it's very very high in cholesterol i'm sure with all the eggs that are in it but uh sure yeah she said that she and her husband had uh traveled in Spain a couple of years ago and and flan is almost uh a basic with every meal that you get there like apple pie in America right uh-huh yeah uh-huh it's just very customary to get flan so if you ever run into that you'll you'll sort of be aware of what that's all about but uh i would never have thought of making that as part of a a Mexican dinner but wow um-hum yeah you know so papillas i guess would be another kind of a dessert if you decided to do something like that but flan is something you can make ahead and have just uh you know have ready but uh oh i would have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon but um-hum um-hum i tell you it that i my it's one of those things where it does require some real uh planning and it's you know you don't just make the dinner you have your house to clean and you know the the whole business that goes with that yes um-hum well when i have a dinner party that's my motivation for getting the house clean yeah probably a good way to do it oh the house needs cleaning i guess i better have a dinner party yeah yeah yeah we're catering a wedding um in August and uh this lady that is it at it's is at her house she's not a a good housekeeper so she's got to hire this crew oh uh-huh oh of four women to come in of two weeks prior to the wedding and get it ready yes and there you know she she must have found some jewels because they start in the corner and work out good heavens uh oh wow that's such a nice thing it's i you know until well we my husband and i've been married twenty six years and until last year i had never had another person clean my house and then i got so involved and so busy i said yeah so um-hum um-hum this is one luxury i'm going to let myself have every now and then and so i had a woman come in uh once a month you know and which isn't very often but for me it was wonderful sure yeah that's nice you know to have that that's a luxury today well it is and it is it buys you time to do other things like have a dinner party so it's just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned but well um i better that's right yeah yeah um-hum i i have a pie crust that recipe that i that is unique that has vinegar and egg in it uh-huh i have heard about that but i've never tried it no um um well i should say i have heard of one that has vinegar in it i don't know that it has egg in it uh-huh uh-huh do you have it right on the top of your head have you okay egg and sugar um-hum um-hum um i no i think it would be too hazy because um the uh no i you don't have it yeah i would i well it's like the liquid is like a half of cup of water and then your egg and then your uh tablespoon of vinegar and you mix that together and then you you know your see it makes uh-huh right it makes uh five pie crusts at once so that's it's quite a volume of um uh quite large yeah right i think it's four cups of flour and like uh a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar and and you combine your dry ingredients and then you uh put in your liquid uh-huh um-hum yeah um what is it about the uh the vinegar that uh makes the crust better it just it just makes it very pliable and and very flaky and you can really treat it rough and you're still going to have a flaky pie crust ah interesting yeah yeah boy that the that's the real secret um-hum like uh it's not mine it was from uh one of the magazines probably twenty years ago and it said you can throw this on the floor and step on it and it will still be flaky and i thought wow that's quite a statement for them to make oh that it makes me think of years ago um when i was visiting my mother-in-law in uh Michigan and she lived very near an apple orchard and we just had we could take as many apples as we wanted from it according you know according to the owners and so i decided to bake about four pies ahead you know and freeze them um-hum um-hum well talk about working with big amounts of pie crust and having it be tough those were the toughest apple crust or apple uh pie crust that i have ever ever made it was just terrible i i could have used that recipe it sounds like oh wow wow well i'm from Michigan where about uh Detroit um-hum uh-huh well we lived in um Plymouth for four years um oh yeah that's real close yeah in fact i we were there from uh seventy three to seventy seven and i was i worked for the little the weekly newspaper there the the the Plymouth Plymouth um oh what was it called Crier and uh um-hum oh how neat my husband is from the upper peninsula so he was born and raised up there and that's where my mother-in-law still lives so uh are you originally from Michigan or uh-huh oh okay um-hum oh yes um-hum born in Detroit um-hum um i'll be darn and  hi Ed hi hi uh books uh i've actually i am reading a couple of different books uh uh one was uh is uh a story well it is not a story it is a collection of um of memos supposedly written by Howard Hughes uh that was uh oh that was it came out a couple of years ago and i have just now gotten around to reading it i have had it a couple years but uh just just who wrote that oh i do not remember the man's name he was used to be a reporter for uh i think the New York Time or the Washington Post one of the two and he supposedly got this this story uh i mean this uh was contacted by this guy who had these these memos he wanted to sell and they were they were ones that had supposedly been stolen from the um corporate headquarters in um in Los Angeles um huh they on i think it was Romain Drive or Romain Street or something there in Los Angeles they used to have a or i guess they still do uh had a uh uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a you know for the size of the company which inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected he he was uh a great collector of everything he he he didn't he didn't throw anything away and uh supposedly this guy had had been breaking there for awhile he was a like you know burglar had been breaking there awhile and uh and had ended up i see he he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect and they uh they broke in one one night and found a bunch of memos that were uh supposedly from from Hughes to uh to his main um main assistant assistant assistant assistant back uh in the fifties and sixties well i guess in the sixties up until his death well that is interesting all right so it's pretty interesting work so that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that yeah it's a it's a little it's a little hard it's a it's a you have to plod through it and you know it doesn't doesn't have a real story or any plot you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on and they haven't made a movie of the week of it yet no i have not seen it but it's but it is it is real interesting yeah uh i also reading uh the uh it's a an old another old book that i happen to have i am sort of rereading it it's um a book about uh the Bermuda Triangle but it's uh it's about it's a real good book that a guy um wrote who was uh a research librarian he wrote um sort of debunking many of the uh uh um the stories about the uh Bermuda Triangle you know he he was saying many many of the uh the myths many of the myths of the triangle were uh actually could be explained and and you know explained like uh and the reason reason i was i hadn't picked it back up was in light of all the uh the well when they found the uh the airplanes out in the Atlantic thinking they were Flight Nineteen and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all but it's uh Flight Nineteen was one of the uh a collection of a flight of five Navy adventures at the end of World War Two Right after World War Two and they were they were lost and uh so supposedly scooped up by the triangle yeah yeah they were and so and in the book you know even he wrote this book back in the seventies and even and even then he he made had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water and uh because he he he mentions he he goes through and and brings out points from the Navy's findings and so forth and uh it's probably you know real close to what you know everyone is thinking now that they just got turned around and couldn't find their way back yeah on that same topic have you ever read anything about you know the Amelia Earhart story whatever happened with her uh no i haven't i i think that would be i am sure there is something out there uh that might a yeah i would i would like to too because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her you know possibilities of her of where she have might have been i thought she was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years well whatever this is one aspect of it of course you know it is so weird cause no one will ever really know it's it the uh yeah so but it's entertaining and it makes you think about things that is for sure right yeah so that is pretty much for right now that is what i have been reading i i kind of like to read different stuff and uh i like to read a novel every now and then but um i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time yeah right well i i guess i just have not read anything i mean usually i just if i find a good book i will sit you know for two days until it is finished if it's that good and i think the last one i read like that was Scott Thurow's yeah and that was Presumed Innocent yes and i just really really liked the way he writes it's just yeah i read that too i got it um right after it came out my uh incredible yeah you know he was an an assistant district attorney in Chicago at uh and while he was writing the book and uh my sister-in-law lives in Chicago and she had before it actually got big she sent me this book saying you might like this this guy is you know from here and uh uh i i read it and really liked it and then about that is when it really got big and uh so i that was good i think and and the other book i am trying to think you know like was in the last year and i think i did read Tom Wolfe and uh Vanity you know Bon yeah i haven't read that although i have heard it is pretty good and yeah i that was really really good the movie was nothing compared to the book and yeah yeah that is what i have heard i saw the movie and oh the movie was a joke compared to i mean because Tom Wolfe is so perceptive when it comes to you know pinpointing um yeah society's society's society's society's ills and things like that and just nailing people to the wall and exposing things and right right and uh it was it was a much more intense book than the sort of flimflam that they cast off in the movie i know and anyway we are not talking about that but um gee i just i like to read gardening books and things like that just to tell me what to do with my garden and and uh yeah i have a lot of computer books because i am i do computer work and so i have a lot of those so i spend a lot of time looking through those not necessarily reading them but uh looking through them so i yeah interested in a lot of that but uh i have got a lot of books that i i intend to read but i have not been able to yet you know for one reason or another like what is a book on your list you know i have a list too and i have never gotten to it oh gosh i don't i don't really have a list because i just kind of uh i just have all the books out you know i have book shelves and i have them all out and usually when i am through with one i will go in and uh uh look look through uh i have one now and i i can't remember the name of it that i that i got is the sister-in-law in Chicago usually sends me for my birthday or or Christmas or something will send me another another good book and oh uh shit i have one and i can not remember the name of it uh it is supposed to be a mystery  hi you want to start first of course we're talking about the elderly and uh whether or not we would we like nursing homes and as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that right uh-huh you apparently have somebody there in one no actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years and her mother oh you are kidding no she did and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home for years and then uh went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home oh uh-huh i will be darned uh-huh and uh my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses oh for heaven's sake so i do know something about that you are very very much aware of what goes on that is great absolutely actually the motivation for grandmother entering the business was that her mother was very old and couldn't seem to find companions uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum she was lonely and she needed company for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies and then uh it it grew into a very prosperous business from that point uh then they right right i will be darned um-hum now see that is a nice attitude to go into uh um-hum it seems like they must be waiting until it's a necessity um-hum and there is no chance of uh good companionship or doing anything well that is not really true either uh i think that is a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences you see those who had bad experiences talk about them um right right and those who don't may write a letter to the nursing home and say you did good but they do not talk a whole lot about that uh-huh that is true but what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home um-hum when you are still able to have good relationships with maybe other friends um-hum um-hum sure well now they wait until they're you know unable that's right well that is because they wait until the children make those choices they choose to not make those choices themselves however my daughter-in-law also is a nurse in a nursing home right right right um-hum and uh she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home and these these i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going for my tennis lessons um um-hum um-hum and uh would you would you you know call down and have the van come around and take us for our tennis lessons and they're very active and very enthusiastic and they have some excellent programs right there on site uh-huh uh-huh yeah their dining room looks like you know Luby's Cafeteria yeah that's great or or one of the lovely cafeterias and they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners and a a well equipped library uh-huh uh-huh yeah that sounds great oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home and i think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just don't want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore that is a wonderful alternative it is expensive it is costly yeah um-hum uh-huh uh-huh see if they could could get this idea across though better than what it is it is costly um-hum well now my daddy's mother uh lived in a a retirement village and she and her sister had side by side duplexes one bedroom duplex she still had her individuality you know um-hum um-hum but they were there close and they did have uh you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems and there were lights that you could flip on and so forth and they he did have security um-hum um-hum no i am very much in favor i have heard horror stories oh well you have that with anything i know that the elderly can easily be abused but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in homes of their own children oh yeah in the homes yeah well we used our nursing home as uh um-hum like when my sister was real bad before she died uh um-hum we took her the last month and a half into a nursing home and they were super with her um-hum um-hum absolutely they were uh well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkin's Disease when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh she went to the doctor she had surgery she got the treatments and during the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home she got better she got well she got out and went dancing again um-hum uh-huh well a lot of people do that they left them temporally maybe they had a broken hip or something or uh-huh that's right uh-huh uh-huh i think it is a wonderful interim place it is a place that you don't have to struggle with hospital problems and uh yet it is not you know you have uh um-hum um-hum and it can become home to them um-hum um-hum it certainly is it it it depends upon the individual right yeah it certainly does but you see we have had excellent experience with that and uh i i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill but i would not object to going to one i might i might like to be uh coherent enough to make my own choice uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say well i think this is what i need for Mom and then dump me there but i would like this this is the age and there has to be consideration taken on everything so that's right um-hum um-hum and i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church or a doctor or anything else yeah that's right you would look into it thoroughly and do do the best job you could in choosing choosing one um-hum sure um-hum when you get to the point where you are in trouble and you have got to have that help you are in no position to make those choices uh-huh no and you do not have the time to look that is what i am saying most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity that's right um-hum absolutely i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they're going to be needing those facilities one day um-hum and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some music programs whatever their talents are and work with those senior citizens whatever their talents yeah yeah i have a cousin who's uh he had a son that was epileptic from birth and he did fine at home they lived on a farm um-hum but she made arrangements so that when she was gone she didn't want her her children her other children burdened with his care um-hum um-hum um-hum that's right so he they she has made arrangements that when she she was gone that he would go into the nursing home um-hum and he's i would say he adjusted very well and uh he he he's been there quite a long time um-hum and uh he don't know me usually but he goes wheeling down uh the hall to bingo somebody else he's helping him out yeah that's right you know and uh he has adjusted very well well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine um-hum oh yes yes routine and uh constancy um-hum um-hum uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over i do not think they pay the nursing home staff sufficiently to to get the dedication uh-huh to keep them there uh-huh that they have in some other profession and that's sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical true yes yes but for for some reason and uh people resist uh the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing you know that's right it seems to be a resistance care for the elderly and care for the children i can't imagine a more costly and a more a more uh better area to invest your money um-hum um-hum right right but there seems to be a resistance you're preserving your heritage and your future there yeah yeah and as a matter of fact i don't see why they don't have children's programs in nursing homes well around here we have some you know the churches um-hum um-hum uh take your the children and i know our kids thoroughly the children thoroughly enjoy  okay so what books do you like to read well all kinds to tell you the truth uh mostly i like uh um science fiction science fantasy type books like what what authors uh well let me see uh well the most my favorite ones are kind of an old author Edgar Rice Burroughs uh-huh and he had a uh series of uh called John Carter Of Mars i don't know if you're familiar with it or not but uh he's the one that wrote Tarzan Of The Apes and all that too and uh and uh no i'm not okay yeah heard of that and uh he uh he had one where this guy was a Civil War soldier and and uh made some trips to Mars and stuff i thought it was really interesting plus i i liked Pierce Anthony uh the one about uh Zanth i don't know if you're familiar with that oh that's interesting no i really i have never really never never read science fiction much and well that was more fantasy i guess and uh because it's kind of neat because it has a lot of puns and stuff you know in it and so it's kind of funny too and then uh uh-huh yeah then i like uh what else do i have there oh it's a series of another fantasy but it's Fred Saberhagen Saberhagen and it's the it's uh The Sword Series which i liked and uh Gore i like too it's another fantasy one uh-huh and uh starting i think i'm going to start pick up a few uh more science fiction as far as well as Isaac Asimov have a number of his books too and H G Wells right that's older stuff yeah uh but but i think they're pretty good and uh and then i'm i think i'm going to start picking up some of the newer Star Treks because i hear they're pretty good too yeah yeah i had a professor at school whose sister wrote a Star Trek episode wrote one of those novels that yeah as under this fake name she wrote it in she's a professor at another university and it was oh really kind of a hush hush thing that she'd written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so um no i don't the author was like Madge Larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist do you know which which one was it uh-huh Star Trek people on a it's the the woman had been a POW in Vietnam who wrote it and so she she's one of the first female POW's and so she had um uh-huh uh-huh kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i don't know if it was interesting just because i knew the person who'd written it or if it was actually a good book uh-huh yeah but i've never really read a lot of science fiction it's uh-huh well i sort of read mostly in high school and uh you know and i and i like it you know as as kind as the light reading and everything and uh i recently uh completed graduate school and i've really kind of got interested right through a number a couple of classes that i took there on on history and stuff and i've gotten a number of history books but i haven't read any yet you know uh right oh but you've got them so that yeah but i've got them and they're ready to go that's right but uh i was kind of getting into you know like uh you know like medieval times and stuff like that and just as to just to do some reading about what went on and everything halfway there so that's good uh-huh yeah i've i've read a lot of medieval literature this year in school a lot of like took a class in Chaucer so we were reading in the Middle English and all that and that was a lot of fun kind of weird but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah and what what which ones do you like um well i'm uh i like a lot of contemporary short stories um uh-huh authors authors like Bobbie Ann Mason she's from Kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff um John Barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avant-garde um uh-huh short fiction and then like in the sixties through the late eighties and he was kind of responsible for turning around the short story movement so that was kind of neat um uh-huh if i'm reading kind of trashy stuff i like um i guess kind of mystery books and then stuff that's funny i like pretty much any humor book uh-huh and gosh oh well i've got those as far as humor i've got a couple of Irma Bombecks too oh that's fun yeah and then also there there's another one i don't know you might have read it The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy yeah there's a series well it was a trilogy with four books and uh have you read those uh-huh right no i i i have one of them sitting on my bookshelf and i just never picked it up do you yeah they're they're pretty funny because it's really kind of interesting and uh uh those are are kind of neat too and i've read uh i like Steve well i like some of Stephen King yeah yeah i i like him i i'm not really too i don't really like his endings so much but uh i think some of his books are pretty good and then there the other one that i've read a little bit is uh um oh God let me go look at his name here it's the one that wrote uh uh-huh yeah i used to um i can't even think of his see oh here oh Clive Barker oh what have you read by him uh The Books Of Blood and uh Cable Cable i guess how you say just you know some paperbacks and stuff uh-huh oh i've never read anything i got a book of his out of the library just the other day to try it out i'd been to England and thought you know he's like the British Stephen King so oh really i'll have to oh did you uh-huh well i like him better than Stephen King yeah he he he's pretty he's pretty good oh well he's next on my list to read i'm reading a little private eye book now yeah and then of course i've read the uh Clancy books yeah you know uh Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Riding Rising oh those are the ones my dad keeps trying to get me to read but i well actually you know Red Storm i haven't i've started Red Storm Rising but uh i really recommend Hunt For Red October uh-huh because it really it's good and and it keeps going pretty quick but the Red Storm Rising i've heard and then it's been apparent the first you know few pages or whatever it's kind of slow in starting and everything well that's good right but it's not a bad book at all well that's interesting i read i like Moby Dick that's a that's my big book that i like yeah yeah actually i i i got an old copy of Moby Dick that i like too i read a while back that's one i just my very very favorite book so if i had to go read something again i'd probably read Moby Dick or Scarlet Letter i also like uh-huh yeah oh probably liked Star Trek Two didn't you no i actually have never seen any of the Star Trek movies was that oh well that's interesting i had a roommate in school who did a did you ever see the movie Heathers oh you hadn't Two was really good because he quoted a lot from Moby Dick no i didn't oh it's it's kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this these kids in high school who are not real popular and they kill all the popular kids in the class it's it's kind of bleak but it's sort of fun and they do a lot of Moby Dick i had a roommate who wrote a whole paper on Moby Dick and Heathers and uh-huh uh-huh wow and well i i thought it was a little much but it was kind of fun yeah i like John Irving that's John Irving yeah he hasn't written much in a while but when he does i'm pretty happy with it yeah oh yeah that's good yeah i'm trying to think what else i've read that i've really just loved i don't know how i it's hard to read when you're in school it's like you just read those textbooks and that's it yeah yeah i know and that will have to do but i guess maybe in the real world too you just don't have time to read but yeah that's pretty much the way it is usually i try to i have some a book or two by the bed and then maybe like i get to read for twenty minutes before i go to sleep or something uh-huh and then you fall asleep and have to reread it the next night because you forgot what you've read yeah i i do that too oh i like Larry McMurtry he's good and like Lonesome Dove was yep that's right yeah uh-huh it was a long book but it was really good well i understand that Peter Benchley is coming out with a new one yeah i just read an article the other day you know uh because i have this Jaws book here and i think he's going to call it The Beast or something like that it's about a squid really uh-huh oh so you know whether or not it will be as good as you know Jaws was i don't i don't know i liked Jaws and The Deep and The Island those were pretty good so i would read that uh-huh uh-huh yeah Jaws actually have have you read the first one the book yeah  okay um the last movie that i have seen it's been it's been a couple of months i saw um Sleeping with the Enemy and Flatliners those were the last two that i've seen yes i saw that one what was the second one Flatliners i didn't see that one oh did you see those because of uh Julia Roberts or for uh the subject matter of the two oh it was just well someone had i had seen the advertisement for Flatliners on TV and i thought i'd like it and then uh one of my friends who went to see Sleeping with the Enemy and she told me to go it was good so that's why i saw that one uh-huh well i've uh i saw Sleeping with the Enemy and i um i've seen uh well just recently um What About Bob no i haven't gotten to see any you know any real recent ones well that one is uh it's cute but kind of far out comedy i like comedies better than i do dramas yeah i uh am not one for the uh i don't need the suspense movies or the the movies with lots of uh the horror movies with uh trying to shake you out of your chair uh-huh did you care for Sleeping with the Enemy um i'm not sure i uh i saw it and uh because my wife wanted to see it uh-huh uh but on the other hand i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise and having gone uh well it really wasn't on a theme that i was uh uh that into or as i say the i prefer the light movies that uh my style of entertainment is is comedy uh primarily uh-huh well i didn't care for the movie myself and then into action films what i didn't really care for the movie either yeah you kind of have to like to be uh drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen yeah uh-huh well okay on likewise then did you see Pretty Woman uh yes do you enjoy that one uh it was interesting but i felt that one was a bit farfetched uh-huh uh in that well i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently the one on um Defending Your Life oh i haven't even heard of that one well that was one where uh it's kind of like to me it's somewhat like Pretty Woman the the story line um if you accept a few of the basic starting points i guess the rest falls in place uh it was hard to accept that uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh this uh multimillionaire wheeler dealer would uh would you know find himself and allow himself to get into that situation uh-huh yeah well i really liked Pretty Woman you know i just well you just kind of went with it like you said you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go yeah it's sort of a modern Cinderella type of story yeah but um Flatliners now it's a drama and i don't usually like them and i really enjoyed it i um i don't know it was kind of it made you think a lot i think did you see Ghost uh-huh yes okay now did you care for that one uh that was i enjoyed that one i in that i i guess i i hate to be too surprised in a movie and in that one you could you could pretty well guess where it was going to end up you weren't sure exactly how it would get there but you knew where it would end up uh-huh see now i didn't i thought it was an okay movie but it wasn't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times uh-huh i didn't think so um i really didn't care for the ending of it i thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen when you know but um i don't know you know well of course uh a bunch of girls had told me and warned me and they said oh it's a real tearjerker and meanwhile i sat through the movie and said well when are you when are you supposed to start crying you know i didn't really yeah well whenever she starts crying uh i didn't really find it to be a tearjerker well do you go to many movies more than once um if i see them more than once i see them on video i never pay to see one more than once uh-huh you know but like you said i i enjoy the comedies a lot better in fact that's where i've seen most of my movies have been on video uh-huh well these days it's uh you see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen well if you don't with some of the movies if you don't go to them within the first four weeks the movie may have uh left town never to show up again until it comes back in video uh-huh so uh unless a movie is popular and stays around uh you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie yeah uh-huh so we have um well i think just most people have VCRs now and we probably watch twice as many movies at home oh yeah as we do at movie theaters uh-huh no i saw one it was a drama also and i can't think of the name of it now that um it was a book before it came out in a movie and it was it was it was a drama it wasn't a comedy uh did you go to Dances With Wolves no i wanted to see that i didn't get to i at least what i hear on that one that it's coming out a second time in a in a longer version oh really even though it was a long movie it's sort of the uncut version at least that was some of the rumors we'll have to see because it's uh there was some talk about that i maybe it will come out this fall there we're sort of in the middle of the summer um season of a lot of new movies coming out but then there's these um periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it uh will increase the revenues from the movie uh-huh well um what movies are showing down there now oh i i'd actually have to get a newspaper out my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them uh i keep track of them a little but you know ask me to name the ten that are out there right now and i'd have to say uh i uh i don't know i i just lo ok at the newspaper before i decide to go and yeah that's pretty much what i do i i know for sure that that one about what was that one about Bob uh it's kind of i think it's just Where's Bob or What About Bob yeah i think it's just playing now up here yeah because some of them they uh they'll start in one area of the country and if they it's  okay do you like to listen to music oh i like to listen to music i just am not a very educated person when it comes to music well i'm not either as far as Bach and Beethoven and all that what what do you like to listen to well it's really strange i like country music and my husband likes the older rock and roll stuff so we've had to kind of educate each other okay that's been kind of strange oh i'm sure yeah but being in from Texas from Austin you'd think you get a lot of good country music well i'm not originally from Austin i'm from Minnesota so it took me moving to Texas to start liking country music oh oh yeah that's true and now i really do i'm i'm really becoming Texanized well have you ever gone to Austin City Limits i haven't but i watch it on i watch it on um television sometimes and and uh i've taken country western dance lessons oh yeah uh-huh oh you have did you like that oh yeah i love it i absolutely love it yeah i took that in college one time as an easy course and uh oh yes i definitely am am much more into country yeah um so you you which uh singers do you like i mean i can actually name singers i'm i'm not too bad oh really well naturally i i like George Strait and uh George Strait and Garth Brooks went to the same college that i went to and he used to play in a little dive there in town when so you know him from when he was a nobody no i don't know him personally but i do remember going to see him when he was a nobody well that's great yeah but i went to see George Strait when George Strait was a nobody too wow so yeah i've kind of followed them well who are you going to go see now i mean who do you see now that's going to be somebody someday well i really like um what's his name Jackson what's his first name oh i can't think of his first name he's a blonde guy and he sings um Alan Jackson oh Alan Jackson yeah um he has some kind of fun country tunes but you know it's really funny because country music has changed so much from when like i remember in driver's ed in high school that that my teacher always liked to listen to country music as we were driving and i thought oh God this stuff is horrible well okay well maybe it just has changed and maybe it's more accepted all over it really has i mean country music is a lot easier for people to break into as opposed to other fields of music so i think a lot of people start out in country and then try to right and then you you know you kind of think of Alabama you know that kind of brought everyone into a more country and and you know yeah yeah definitely yeah i used to go see them they weren't nobodies then but i did go see them before they got to be major big stars yeah so it was fun but Kenny Kenny Rogers he's kind of country and kind of rock you know oh yeah yeah i remember because when i was taking driver's ed is right when You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me Lucille came out and it seemed like every other song on the radio was that song had to listen to that one again yeah oh but it's fun i really i i enjoy listening to it i i keep my radio on at the office but i don't you know i don't have it turned up real loud unless it's a really good song uh-huh and then you just you you pump up the volume yeah yeah just a little see it's real funny because the guy that i work with is from um New Jersey and he is trying to learn now about country music he's gotten to where he really likes it but he doesn't know any of the names of the people or from New Jersey yeah that's great yeah just yeah i was so amazed that's like about the farthest call from country music you can get yeah oh but he's got he's real funny because his office is across from mine and so he'll turn up the radio real loud and say who's this singing oh that's great where do you work i work for a computer company oh that's super yeah it's it's fun because it's small enough that we can do stuff like that and get away with it so you can do things like that yeah i'm i'm i'm being envious well one thing that i did in music that i mean was a big extravagance for me but so i have two daughters that are eleven and fourteen and Whitney Houston just came to town and and she was coming to town the same day that my daughter was getting her braces off so i and i really like her so i thought well uh-huh oh really oh wow we'll we'll go buy tickets and this is how we'll celebrate getting braces off teeth yeah and she really she really i i wouldn't say it was the a great concert uh-huh not that i've had that many but i know it wasn't a great concert you know yeah but it wasn't a bad one either and the one thing that i really appreciated in going to hear her sing in person is her extreme volume for that tiny little body you know and she really does have to work to get it all out oh really oh yeah and you'd you wouldn't catch that you know off of a a CD or a cassette you know yeah well did you happen to see her um welcome home show on the HBO for the troops i did not no she had so much energy i mean she danced and danced and danced and i thought golly that's like a two hour aerobic class yes i know i know so that that was really really fun um-hum yeah that would be neat i didn't know she was going to be in Austin yeah that was just last week wow um-hum huh well that's neat so we had a good time yeah well are you familiar with Don Henley at all i'm not he um used to play with The Eagles have you do you know anything about them i know Eagles uh-huh okay well he was one of the original Eagles and he's broken off now and gone solo and he was in Dallas Saturday night and put on a wonderful concert he sang wow for like three hours and he sang a lot of old stuff and a lot of his new stuff so it was really exciting well you know now that you mention it i probably had would know you know know a song of his yeah i'm sure yo ur daughters do oh yes i well they're you know they know everything and then they always ask me if i know sport figures too so i'm a real flunky you know yeah well i in fact i had older singers so or older older singers older sisters oh so they kind of so i got to listen i got to listen to Herman's Hermits and all that stuff so that was fun and it's but it's really funny now because i'll i'm going to be thirty in August and it's sad because i listen to the oldies' station and i know all the songs i know i know it's kind of depressing it is it's it's sad when you reach that age i know but you're not doing bad i have a a good friend that i mean she's much older than i am she's i think about fifty eight and she's really up on all the new music even better than i am and and i mean she just likes music and she's just a person that's really with it so maybe you'll be like she is oh really yeah well i hope it's really funny though because i'll be at the club working out and i'll hear the aerobics music going and i'll think God that's a remake of an old song right right and it really gets bad when you can remember what you were doing oh i remember i know remember the original that's right oh and we're we're just getting to that age where we date ourselves all over the place oh i know it's pretty sad but it's real funny with my husband too because he really likes older rock and roll so did he really like Beatles yeah he i mean he's got Beatles and Crosby Still and Nash and you know all those songs that that my sisters know i mean my sisters listen to Beatles but not any of the other ones i mean like he likes Santana and some kind of off the wall ones so uh-huh i'm getting indoctrinated to a new a new uh line of music you're picking up some new stuff yeah it's fun though we have a good time because oh it is  okay yes uh well right now we have one dog inside uh-huh she goes out but i mean she's an indoor dog yes and two outside cats oh gosh and how long have you had them male and female the male the dog is probably about about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are yes they might be as old i'm not sure yeah kind of lose track well that's interesting because we have a similar we don't have cats but we do have a dog who is an indoor dog and she is going to be thirteen this summer so yes uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh is that right what kind of dog do you have um she's um a mix of Cockapoo Cocker Cocker Spaniel and Poodle oh that's what ours is yes is that right isn't that interesting what color is your dog white oh well ours is black so definitely different yes she's a female and she's um been she's been a really a really good companion for me um she's like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time and oh uh-huh i'll be darned uh-huh oh yeah and um she's slowing down considerably she doesn't hear very well and she doesn't see very well but she's yeah at this age i guess so uh-huh well that's to be expected at their age yeah but um she's been a good dog to have and i don't know once she's gone i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not well everybody always says no more but i i think animals are really important in the family i yeah yeah i agree yes um did you get yours as a pet for your children do you have children uh-huh uh yeah we have five ah uh-huh oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before or well we have had we had had a a dog before she was fifteen when she died and uh this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to come or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this my goodness uh puppy that somebody people drop things like that off up there and i said gee she sounds like a cute little dog i told the kids let's go look at her uh-huh yeah uh-huh oh yeah go get her so that's how we got her quite by accident isn't that yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um uh-huh uh-huh she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy i mean they were all over the place and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us and i thought that's the dog for me oh oh she picked us yeah so she and it what was funny was that um our daughter must have been let's see she must have been about eight at the time i guess and um uh-huh she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her oh oh uh-huh our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals oh for heaven's sake so you just never know how that works out no but they say it's real important for children to have pets because uh well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and uh-huh yes yeah nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or that's right that yes they're very unjudgmental oh dear yeah yes and the nursing homes now they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uh-huh and how uh-huh our one our one nursing home in Brooksville has one uh-huh permanent is that right he he kind of has free run of the place and there is somebody or somebody takes care of him isn't that amazing but he goes up and down the halls visiting people and real nice dog uh and uh uh-huh yes it's funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um Saint Louis and uh-huh um there were several dogs on the campus and and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didn't appear to belong to anyone and um i'm sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs uh-huh oh really oh yeah but um our guide that day said that the lady one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam around around the campus is that right which is the strangest thing i had ever heard yeah because most campuses don't allow pets you know they just do not allow them i know yes i know it that's that's kind of great yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too but um the i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home yeah yes yeah uh-huh so um but uh i this is the only pet we've had since you know in all our years of marriage um and it's been uh sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up um his father had dogs but they were always hunting dogs and so they were never allowed in the house you know they were always kind of yeah right that's what he said yes so having a pet was a little bit different for him oh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah we've ruined them they say they'll ruined them well we've had a lot of different pets we had the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time uh-huh yeah oh yes and we've had it we've had a skunk for a pet oh my golly for more years than i want to think about she was in the house oh gosh isn't that interesting i don't think i've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet oh well don't don't ever get one for a pet they're okay but like she uh they don't ever learn their name ah uh you can't you could never call her and she would come to you you had to go chas e her down yeah i'll be darned how interesting and uh their eyesight they can't see very far either but uh-huh i guess i've heard that uh-huh they they before before we got her everybody said oh they're just like a cat you know uh-huh and uh they're not i mean they use the litter box that's about it as far as isn't that interesting that's that's really something um how long did you have that oh my how how long probably seven or eight years goodness sake and finally my children are the ones who said mom you've put up with that skunk long enough so we moved her to the basement and i don't think she was there a week till the men moved built built her a pen outside and i thought i put up with that all those years oh my gosh Isn't that funny yes and this is what it took finally that is and we've had we've had cats two stay in the house we had we had two Siamese cats uh-huh yeah uh-huh different times right uh one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back my goodness and we would see him uh several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there uh-huh i'll be my goodness he really grew but he he never came back that's interesting that's interesting i i wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat well he wasn't a whole lot he was in the house most the time but uh he did go out sometimes and uh they make it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside uh-huh yeah is that right yeah the the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if they're kept in the house all the time and their cat uh was not a friendly cat it was uh-huh well it was not a good i don't know it got it was just did get strange and since they've moved to where they are they let the cat out and it has improved the personality yeah so that that was right uh-huh  well we've talked a little bit about the Plano school system um i i really have been pleased with Plano i have a child who uh my son is learning disabled uh-huh and uh i thank God every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into now is he the elementary school he's in elementary school and he's not severely learning disabled i mean you know he just uh-huh uh-huh but he is being helped he's being helped he he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math and they recently released him from resource which i'm i was thrilled i really was i i just uh-huh oh great thought that was so neat that they got him over that hump and um he's in the Herman Method of Reading i don't know if you're familiar with that it is something new and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters no that's something new to me i'm oh um i think i read about that in the paper doctor Haggard is it's wonderful is heading that up yes and it's wonderful he didn't have a problem with reading as a matter of fact he's reading on level the problem was his spelling uh-huh and you know in in watching the way he has struggled it's interesting because i'm convinced i have the same learning disability or had that was ignored and oh right so you worked you learned how to solve your problems on your own that's right and and so it's you know it's not an intelligence problem it's just a problem with learning has has he had this since kindergarten or is this something that maybe learning phonetics and then he just didn't learn the right way well you know it's funny when um when he was in first grade he had trouble with with spelling and i would say to the teacher uh-huh you know it's amazing he will be able to you'll say to him spell cat and you know he'll say C A T and then he would go to write it and he would write C O T okay and i kept saying to the teacher something is wrong here something is wrong here and the teacher kept saying oh he has a May birthday he's just immature you're right right right well second grade it was i will these teachers as far as i'm concerned are absolute saints because in second grade it was about the second week of school i went up there and i i requested a conference good good that's great for parents to be involved and because all year long they kept telling me i was crazy well i was and i and i went up there the second week of school and i said you know something is wrong and thank God the leader the head teacher the team leader was a special education major oh how great it was it was and so she she was able to zero in oh she had picked it up yep she had already picked it up and she said you know we we were going to call you if you hadn't called us we think there's a learning disability and we think he needs to be tested immediately because you know once the first report card comes in they have all these people being tested and she said i think we can get him real fast huh uh-huh uh-huh and sure enough they tested him and you know he qualified for for the help and it's been great and i and i thank God i'm here because i i know i have a sister who has the other extreme she has a a child in Connecticut who is extremely gifted and because of the cutbacks in the economy they have nothing for her right oh no and and to me that's the same thing it's it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored this poor gifted child is being ignored uh-huh uh-huh right but that's something that parents i think are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child that's true so because that's something you can do by just enrichment types of things in the home that's true uh-huh but learning disability unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that then it makes it real difficult and this is this to me is the benefit i see in public schools is that that uh you do have government money to fund the kinds of programs uh-huh yes right right that these students need and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem they test kids before they take them exactly and and if they're a behavior problem they're out that and and uh they don't take them that's right right this is kind of a rejection type of thing and and we get it even at our level in in i work a nine ten school uh-huh and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the uh parochial and public and uh private schools uh-huh and uh they come in and their attitude is i'm a bad boy and proceed to prove it really really so i i really hate that for them i i would rather they not have that attitude but yeah well when comparing test scores i know recently i was in a discussion and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools and that was one of the points that i made is that you're not comparing apples to apples that's right that's right you know you can't say um you know i know Steven probably would not be accepted because he has a learning disability and into a private school uh-huh into a private school and um which is which is too bad but on the other hand i i can't necessarily blame them you know they they are a private school and they can do whatever they want no that's right they can be selective right and they can they that's right they have the ability to be selective but you can't say then well public schools are are not as good right perhaps they are because they're they're if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them and then compared them to the private to the private school group then i think you would have a more equitable you're right way and i have a problem when they compare the kids in Japan or Germany to the kids here in in in uh honesty honesty the kids in Japan are they have to try out to even get into to which kindergarten they're going to get into oh really and then after uh and if if you only the in fact they've had cases in the past where parents have committed suicide because their child has not gotten into the top kindergarten which means they probably won't get into the top elementary and and high school and if they don't then after when they reach a certain age they just that's the end of their schooling uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and and uh they don't ever really go on it's only their top ones that go on like ours do uh-huh uh-huh and and uh so that that creates a problem and and you can't compare because they go so many more hours yeah the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education and is that child right well you see that with the foreigners that come here that's right um i i was talking to somebody recently or read somewhere where they where they said that you know these children they they had to be the best and they put off all social life all everything you know well is that good yes the child is very bright that's right that's right bright but on the other hand i feel like my children who are kind of middle of the road have are more rounded you know sure sure i think it's real important to have friends i think it's real important to play sports i think it's real important to be part of a team better coping skills yes right and so that's why i said their childhood is extremely different from mine we didn't do all that you know we certainly didn't carpool and run the way i do um right well and you don't you don't see the parents uh encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or drill teams or band no right right it's strictly stick to the educational and it's interesting to see them as they get older uh then that is the type of adult they are uh-huh um  uh we are to discuss air pollution and uh what we think the causes are uh-huh and i probably would uh target uh industry as being number one polluter yeah that's probably a major one i think uh individually uh just by the vast number of people there are there's i think cars are also a major contributor to it well vehicles and and yes and yeah vehicles but right because uh there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there especially those the big rigs like the busses and um the big uh eighteen wheelers and so forth uh-huh uh-huh i think they would generate probably uh one of them would probably generate enough for three cars but that's not and i think it can be resolved if uh if they really let go with the technology that they have at uh at their hand and they haven't released it yet just a minute i'm on the phone uh-huh i think there's a lot of hold back uh because of uh oh priorities that they have you know and um it's you have some children yeah well it yes i have i have five in the kitchen at the moment you need to shut the door please shut the door right now we have the air conditioner running what do you need hurry i'm on the phone yes you may and they keep turning the tape recorder up besides oh okay do you have do you watch children or do you um i have three of my own and i have uh two that i'm tending for the summer off and on so uh-huh well well that's interesting um is there anything they cause more noise pollution than air pollution well temporarily they do then we get out of that phase that's right that's right yeah soon enough but um i think another you can tell when you go around cities you can smell specific things from from uh specific industries um oh yes i remember being i i grew up in New Jersey um-hum and uh i can remember the smell of Newark vividly and it's the type of industry you know which obviously if you can smell it it's in the air uh-huh sure um-hum well i know uh uh in Michigan uh the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air yeah and um of course now well people think you burn it it's gone but it's not gone no and when they and you bury it and it's not gone either because it has untold ramifications um-hum and uh then it just gets into the soil and into the water and it gets into into people you know which is uh the the most important um yeah resource that we have is people and they're and they're destroying us they really are yeah we really have to do more so i think the cockroach will evolve uh safely safely i think we've got to do more with the recycling that's i'm i'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening so they say yes but there's not enough yeah and we need expert cooperation well it's a we're getting at least they're starting you know so at least they're moving that direction yeah education of the education of the people is primary i would think yeah and uh and we're hard to teach um-hum well it's going to it's probably going to be a generation or two before we are hard to teach absolutely yeah before it's really going very well because um-hum now the adults are more aware of it and the children are being taught in the schools more it'll be you know on down the road this is going to be passed on which is good absolutely yes uh of course uh we would like to see it accelerated because uh of the critical nature of it um-hum the the learning of it and the just to um think that way we have to be in that thought pattern and able to um motivate ourselves to um uh do what is right for the atmosphere um-hum um i think we're all contributors i mean every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution so yeah yeah we just um i think you're right education is a big thing you know and as we educate them individually what they can do um-hum people become more aware of the things in industry too that that are causing problems and and i think that they'll gradually they'll work towards solving those problems more too um well hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past um-hum that the time frame for cleaning up our air and our and our um land you know which uh we get our nutrients from you know i mean everything goes back to the land yeah just a minute and i'll turn it up i'll turn it up in a minute honey when i'm done so um it's just um very critical i think at this point to uh get that through to the people and get us educated uh-huh yeah well i think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem um-hum i i don't know if they offer classes in uh the uh in the grade school uh uh subjecting um i think they teach it a lot in science in science okay yeah i would think that that's where it would come through what grade level would that be would that be um perhaps the first grade level which would be i i think they're kind of getting it in all different grades well i mean are they starting though at at with the children that are so their little minds are like sponges and they can really uh relate to that yeah i think they are starting probably in the first grade they're you know they're hearing somewhat about it um i know uh Target has their program to make kids more aware of it and target stores yeah oh okay they've got if you go in the entrance they've got uh stands usually where they have um little uh kind of a little newspaper thing that the kids can read and and they can form a a group to okay oh i see um help fight the pollution oh that's wonderful uh yeah yeah so well i'm sure that uh perhaps they're the leaders you know and other will others will pick up on their example and carry it um further yeah you know because um thoughts are well i i know it's hard it's a hard problem to solve because you you know like McDonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing and um-hum and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more and then there's the paper and plastic bag question  do you use credit cards a good bit i do and i wish i didn't before i got married uh about the only credit cards i used were gas cards because i didn't like carrying uh you know the cash with me all the time but i just never wanted to get into the hang-up of using credit cards and having all those bills hanging over my head um-hum um-hum um-hum in fact i remember getting my first MasterCard and the only reason i got it was you know there was a while years ago when you couldn't cash a check without like a MasterCard or Visa and so that's why i went ahead an got one okay absolutely right um-hum it was a mistake yeah well actually i i have a whole wallet full of credit cards i don't use them very often um yeah oh i may use i try to use at least one gasoline credit card a week and try to use a different one so that you know i have keep those active yeah i have a half a dozen department store credit cards and i'm i'll use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick or something like that just enough to keep them active my biggies are the Visa MasterCard and Discover yeah yeah and for the most part i had used those for like uh charging airline tickets where i can pay for those you know you could make make the transaction over the telephone or i fly Southwest a good little bit which means i can just run that card through the machine yeah that's right uh and saves a lot time and that's what i was using it for however we had a had a a very pressing financial family crisis which said you have no alternative you must have the money to do this with and you do not have any other options so i charged all three of those cards up and right now i am paying paying and praying um-hum i know how that goes and that's exactly what we've i mean i have to say i have been thankful for them because there were times when um but uh um-hum um-hum it was just like that when we had to have the money we had no way around it and the only way to do it is go get you know an advance on a card and so like you were paying for it but it's one of those i'm glad it was there um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum well i never did right i never did use it for an advance most of my charges were uh medications oh i see didn't have cash for the medications or it was uh the doctor would accept MasterCard or Visa oh and uh a lot of times you can get by using those for uh uh different labs will use those charge accounts for well do you find now though that even some doctors won't i've gone some doctors that say you know i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards and so many of them don't anymore um-hum so well i have not i like i said that was just one period in my life where that was critical yeah i don't generally charge i say well i will need a checkup in six months and i kind of set that aside and just pay for it i'm reimbursed on insurance anyway and i can handle you know paying for it and waiting two or three weeks yeah right right getting into a credit card fiasco is easy oh it is it is easy and it's very difficult to get out i just cringe every month when i see those interest charges i know i say wow i i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off big deal i'm saving two percent right but you know the interest even though it bothered me it didn't used to bother me so much because of course you could list it on a schedule A and you got all your interest you know towards your tax deductions and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it and but it but it is easy to get into a credit card problem and i um-hum um-hum right i think about young people that think you know there's kind of that feeling of hey it's so neat i have my first credit card and and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments you know um-hum oh yeah and it's not just paying back what you've charged it's paying that and half again uh you send in uh uh fifty dollars you're going to pay twenty twenty five in interest charges that's right that's right that's right you only get half of that paid for the principal so i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts now as the monthly payment right uh i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments uh as long as i don't have a major disaster where i have to use it again i can i can do that right right meantime though i'm not building any reserves anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards no and that's frightening to me that's right that's frightening too uh i i just i my husband is in business for himself i work for TI but he doesn't and uh uh-huh um-hum um-hum we're uh i i've kind of got my fingers crossed crossed i've learned when you're in business for yourself that that you you don't count on something until it's happened you know but he's got some um-hum you know it's those once in a lifetime cases and after ten years he's got two of them um-hum and they should pay through next month and and we're both just looking at each other every night going man that'll pay off like both of our MasterCards you know and you know just in one lump because that's the only way you can do it is to have a big chunk of money or it's like you say you pay forever oh right right um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and so i'm really looking forward to that well you either need a big chunk of money or you need a large reserve so that if you do charge on that account you can make a single lump sum payment now those are very handy if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments sharp good no problem that's right right sure yeah i agree that's right because you're living on the other guy's money for a while but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money and it just irks me i say my gosh i had to work three hours just to pay the interest on this and i've got three cards i've lost a whole day of my life i know and i know you're like what am i working for today to interest yeah yeah and that just blows my mind i my house is paid for my car is paid for i've got some home improvements but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards it's incredible boy i wish i could say that my house and well my car is paid for now it was wrecked three weeks ago but um-hum but you see again the credit cards came in handy i had to have the money to pay rental car pay this pay that till the insurance company pays back and uh um-hum that's right i think that is a good healthy safe use of credit cards yeah because you know that's coming back to pay it off um-hum um-hum uh i went to a seminar they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items you only use credit cards for investments right i say for crying out loud if i had the money to invest you know if i could do some investing you'd have to invest at better than twenty percent earnings in order to pay for the payments on the credit card it sure that's right that doesn't make a bit of sense to me i thought God dang where is his pencil that's right well the smart half was don't pay it for consumables don't you know if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash don't put it on a credit card you know and and so that that is the smart half that's right um-hum but uh and i can remember before we had kids we did that a lot but it was no biggie um-hum you know because we could pay it off while after kids and you're paying child care and other things all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off so we cut that out real quick um-hum um-hum and uh but i i do like having them there there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis they are there to use um-hum but you have to have a very good sense of saving and or common sense not not to get yourself in trouble um-hum um-hum you also have to have that willingness to commit to that because you're committing a good portion of your life and income when you do it um-hum  okay what kind of pets do you have i have two miniature Schnauzers oh how cute are they very old um one of them is just a year old and the other one is four oh so get got one with a lot of puppies still in it um-hum i am afraid so do you train them did you train them uh-huh somewhat do can they do tricks and stuff well a little bit i am mainly i just like them for companionship and you know they they they can retrieve and that sort of thing but yeah oh really i don't teach them to do dancing or anything how about yourself well my husband thinks he's married to Ellie May Clampitt is that right yes we have four dogs and lots of fish and then uh where i live i have some wild rabbits that live outside so uh-huh i consider them my pets too um-hum i go out and talk to them and give them you know things out of the refrigerator i do not know if they ever really eat any of it or not but uh my dogs are mainly just mutts they are they are all big though they are like half Lab and half Collie um-hum oh okay so i have big dogs and i had never had big dogs until i got married i had a little toy Poodle as i was growing up um-hum and my dad had bird dogs but you know i normally i was used to having a little puppy that i could hold and snuggle and boy these big dogs are something else um-hum but you know what it surprises me my neighbor has um Dalmatians and they want to be in your lap just like puppies do oh really yeah that's what one of my my male dog thinks he is a lap dog but uh it's real funny because we have a water bed and one of my dogs is afraid of the thunder and so when it thunders she hits the water bed and like catapults you up um-hum um-hum it's a real treat yes i'm sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you oh no but it's real funny cause she's just big and she's real ferocious but boy if it thunders she is just like a little baby hum that really tames her down quick doesn't it oh yeah it's real funny i got a book on you know how to train you dog to keep from being afraid of thunder but golly i had to quit my job and stay home um-hum that's interesting i i had a a miniature Schnauzer um i've always had them well since the early seventies i really like the breed yeah um but my silver one i had to put to sleep a few years ago but now she she was afraid of thunder but she would go into the main bathroom which is surrounded by the house there's no outside windows or anything okay oh uh-huh uh-huh and i guess she felt safest there but she'd crawl into the bath tub really um-hum whenever there was thunder and lightning and then i felt just bad for her because she would shake even thought she was in there but there was not much i could do oh yeah huh but the other the the puppy i got after that which is the the four year old and then um i bought a mate for her to have company and uh the young one that's a year old they do not even notice it when it thunders and lightning huh-uh it does not bother them a bit really that's good do they play get along real well with each other um-hum very well together yeah yeah well that's what my uh Dr Jim Humphrey's i watch his show sometimes and he said that dogs are pack animals and so they are a lot happier when they have a buddy to play with um-hum yeah and i always felt so guilty leaving the one by itself you know and of course with your four oh yeah oh yeah they have they have a big time yeah oh that's great but it's really funny cause i mean you know obviously nobody plans to have four dogs but uh my husband had the two and then um-hum shortly after we got married the couple behind us had a dog that they just were tired of and they were going to have her put to sleep and she was just gorgeous and we said no we will take her and find her a home and we did um-hum you kept her and then the little one that or the the last one i guess i should say um my husband saw her get hit by a car so he loaded her up and brought her home thinking we'd find her a home and we did oh um-hum because right now i am so attached to all of them i could not get rid of one if i had to i know well they sound like they are real fortunate to have found you too you know oh yeah yeah they are real fun we take them pretty much everywhere i mean we have to God it costs us a fortune to board them oh well sure it would but um we go camping and they go with us and we have the best time um-hum well how do you maintain any decorum around your house it's difficult um they are all black and so i told my husband i said boy next time we are either going to get a black carpet or blonde dogs um-hum because i said this is just too much and then people say when are you going to have children and we are like well when we start getting rid of dogs um-hum my i have a neighbor we live on most of the lots out here are a half acre to an acre oh wow and they have five and what she's done is she sees them along side the road stray or something she will bring them home oh my gosh oh yeah and her husband finally said that's enough you know we can't have any more but it's amazing i have gone over there and the majority is they were two two large dogs and they're outdoors and the other three were in the house but you would never know that she had dogs uh-huh really yeah she must scrub the floors every day well my husband vacuums a lot especially when they are shedding um you almost have to that's why i had the miniature Schnauzers cause they do not shed yeah oh really well now my dad just got a Schnauzer but i do not know i guess it's not considered miniature because um it's what i consider normal size they have the standard and the giant and uh i understand i've been to dog shows and i have seen them i have not been around them but i understand that they are very gentle animals oh huh even even so they are so big yeah but uh the only thing that well how big is big i mean like the size of a Collie big um i believe the the standard are the size of a collie and the giant gets bigger than that if i am not mistaken wow oh well then what daddy has must be a miniature too because it's the miniatures are usually about fifteen inches high yeah yeah yeah and that's how my are and then you know even though they are miniature they can be large for their size or small for their size huh well have you ever seen a Schnoodle yes i just love they were so cute yes um a member of my family has one back home yeah they they are real cute oh really well the first time i saw one i just fell in love and me and Kyle just said like no we can't have any more dogs i know come on now get serious right that's enough is enough uh-huh yeah it just kills me to go i can't even go into a pet store because i want a puppy so badly oh yeah and so it's real funny all my girlfriends say yeah everybody else is saying i want a baby and Jackie is saying i want a puppy well i don't know if you if you have ever had a litter but it's a wonderful experience yeah um the older one that i've got she's had two litters and it is so much fun no really oh wow oh but i just couldn't bear to give those puppies away it oh listen i raised three of them i kept three until they were about four months old i just could not part with them and then you know i had to oh oh yeah and i didn't think i would be able to sell them when they were three months old but it was amazing i have a i have an enclosed patio and so that's where i kept the dogs and there's a doggie door they can go in and out into the backyard that's fenced so the mother trained the puppies yeah oh really well that's neat yeah to to go in and out and it's real interesting to watch how they they take care of one another and how she corrects them and and when they they fight like kids and she will break them up it was just really neat yeah huh huh and uh it was it was quite an experience and i wanted to the other one that i have is black and silver and i wanted to have puppies with her but she had a medical problem and i had to have she had to have surgery so oh yeah oh yeah she is not able to have puppies but she's and don't don't you  okay uh do you have annual family reunions or uh yeah uh our the my my my mother's side of the family is quite large or well was quite large at one time and uh they uh for as long as i can remember have had uh a yearly reunion um back uh early on they used to to rotate them from house from some to to different people's houses in the family um-hum all local were they like all in Dallas and uh no no not no this was well i am actually from Mississippi and so that's it was it was around there generally uh that's where the family oh uh-huh uh-huh just from city to city then huh grew yeah and it was not only in Mississippi in some other places as well so it was uh um-hum um-hum it it it was a big deal but uh they they tried to to centralize it in one spot so in the past couple of years they had it at um state park every year um-hum um-hum we rent a pavilion and and do that and that's usually works out to be pretty good uh they will rent a pervilion pavilion on a weekend and uh do you go back i haven't gone back lately in fact uh this past Sunday was the uh was the reunion but i didn't get to go uh i have is it choice or just business or not getting to go uh just uh the distance involved and uh just not um-hum um-hum um-hum i have a younger daughter now and uh i it's kind of hard to get her get her there and everything but i am going to to uh um-hum hopefully next year get to go back because uh a lot of the family has not uh on her side my mother's side has not seen you know my daughter so oh do you have brothers and sisters i have one brother uh-huh uh-huh and is your mother still living so yes oh so so you go back and visit with her anyway wouldn't you i mean either way there was family reunion time or right yeah right i i usually see her a couple times a year so that's no no or not big thing but uh i uh i do i do enjoy the reunions the only problem is that now um originally originally when we had them uh they were mainly my mother's uh father's my mother's father's family had quite a few uh relatives right um-hum brothers and sisters so it was a large reunion of of of of that group uh from that descendancy um-hum and uh a lot of those people have and and at time you know they all knew one another right right and now it's gotten uh that uh a lot of those people are died have uh have died off or you know what we are left with is the the relatives of of of that group the next generation uh-huh and so uh it's not quite as close as it used to be so i think people feel less of a of a desire to really go i know that why why why do you think that it's less close than it used to be well i i just think that uh you know at that time when when they were you know those were all brothers and sisters a lot and or they were all in the same area geographical location you know back back around you know in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up um-hum um-hum um-hum um you know they were all located together together in one small community right right right and as as time grew i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth and now when you when you they come together it's it's generally you know like say the kids kids of those people who are not you know anywhere near one another and i don't think they feel the the the closeness that they used to be there um-hum which is a shame but that's just how it is my mother was complaining last year about the you know it's dwindling down every year you know that's just i think that's just is that just family's lack of priority anymore maybe yes that we get so involved in our work lives and just well yeah social lives and so forth that yeah that's uh yeah i think that's some of it but you know I i i it's just the way you know i think society society is now is that we are not we don't have the extensive family we used to it's more of a you know a smaller uh-huh smaller unit and you know we we tend to try to do things i think with with our immediate family as opposed to the extended family of people that we may or may not remember or know you know very well uh right right it really makes an effort on to to do this anymore right right right it requires a lot of effort to to to to do that sort of thing i mean i i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it doesn't it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing right right you know i it's going just for the sake of getting together i think for the family and do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group uh on a regular basis not just Christmas cards though um um no not really that in that but then again uh well i you know i have some aunts that uh i i i i do that's about my mother's sisters um-hum um-hum you know but i feel closer to them because i kind of grew up with them but but uh as for the you know for the rest of that group no not really right you know and and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion so uh you do not really feel that right right that really close to them right in my my uh father's family we get together every year at a different location either Dallas or Oklahoma City they had chosen Santa Barbara California for this summer and and didn't get enough people that were willing to go that far because most of us live either in the midwest or like in the Texas Oklahoma area um-hum and uh so they canceled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter um-hum that circulates and it usually goes through me twice a year and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the your new letter on the top and then that's the way it's kept in order and then about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion you don't feel like i don't know anything about this person you've you've read something about what is going on and about their children and so forth so you are kind of half way acquainted that way that's a good idea right and that that's been a that's been a nice way of yeah keeping us all aware of each other i think right we tried to start that in my husband's family his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago and i said well let's start this letter and it just never my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us and that's as far as it got i sent it on to the next one and and but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one in Scottsdale Arizona for that family yeah um-hum and uh we're real glad we got together because since that that time there were only like two of the one sister and one sister-in-law of the original family left and the sister-in-law died and the sister is in a nursing home so we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago  well Steve did you go to college yeah in fact i'm still going oh that's good so you probably could give some great advice uh well i don't know about that but i in fact i'm in the process of trying to choose a PhD school uh-huh well what's your career what's your interest your uh uh well computer science and cognitive science so uh-huh that that's similar to what i'm in a PhD program right now oh i see and uh my area of expertise it's information systems which is a little bit less technical i think than uh than computer science but my area of expertise is uh uh human computer interaction oh yeah and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study uh because it's of i'm working with voice systems yeah yeah so so good luck i guess we should talk about giving advice though what what what what type of advice do you think you'd give to a a parent yeah to a parent well you know the thing is when you're a kid yeah um-hum and the kid at that age especially if they're going into undergraduate it seems like they think they know what they want an and i mean choosing from my experience you know my i thought you know my i know what i want a lot more than my parents know what i want yeah uh-huh but uh i don't know at the same time you have to decide what is important about the school you know the size of it or yeah i think that's more important probably than even the career vocation because most people change yeah i know i know very few people that uh started in one field and stayed with it you know they i think that's what you just said you know having to do more with the size of the school the environment of the school uh i think that's much more important i i think i'd i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school though that has a number of different types of programs you know that uh some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer but some of the uh small some of the larger small schools you know i guess around three or four thousand students have a can offer a broader range of curriculums and things so if the kid does change they don't have to transfer or they don't have to uh yeah uh i don't know they don't have to give up years of you know of credit transfer and things yeah that's disruptive yeah i i normally and and parents hate to hear this you know because i i actually teach college i i hate to uh i hate to talk to the parents because um one of the reasons is because you know the kid doesn't know exactly what they want and i always say make sure you major in something that you like even if it's not going to be your career vocation because you'll get better grades i i think most employers would probably rather hire you know a a three six in um in history uh to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration oh yeah yeah well yeah i see what you're saying that make sense yeah i always you know tell them that you should major in something you you're going to get good grades in because that that's always i think more important yeah you know overall uh give me five minutes i don't know yeah oh you you're at the office now you are at work yeah yeah yeah i'm just getting ready to go to lunch uh yeah that's like what we were saying though would you uh advise a private school or a public school you know what's the trade off there what i would i would it would i i tell you i live in Maryland could you get me those and the public schools here are pretty good i teach at a public school actually and i know that the SAT scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the public school a lot of the private schools and um i actually i would full time at a at a public school and then right now i'm teaching part time at a private school at a Catholic institution oh i see and um and i really think i i think i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated where at the public school i don't think as many parents are public are are college educated and i don't i think because it costs less the kid doesn't take it quite as serious you know they're not it it's the minimal cost but i think you can get a good education at public or private uh but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private you know i you have to really you have to look around at the school i i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for yeah yeah yeah i think uh i would agree with that in fact the thing that i'm going through the same thing where in graduate school i was trying to choose you know a particular institution might be better um-hum right for my area yet uh-huh like say you know the University of Small Town in Arkansas or something might have some top specialists in my area yet if i go to U of I or CMU or you know some you know any big name school um-hum right my quality of education might not be that much better but it's the same thing as you know what will the name recognition get me kind of thing right yeah does it have a big ten football team or is it yeah yeah that's that's usually the basic criteria yeah i mean uh yeah is it a PAC ten school you know but i think yeah see i'm i'm at the University of Maryland so in this this region yeah um though i go to a smaller branch of the University of Maryland my diploma will still say University of Maryland um oh you know it doesn't doesn't differentiate on my diploma though i would put it on my resume what program i went to but i i think you know i'm actually at a smaller program i'm not at the college the big College Park campus you know that's the big one with the football team yeah so i i think um i think you're right that there's a lot of there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition um you know when i first was applying for graduate schools i applied to some big programs you know in this area like Stevens Institute of Technology which is recognized in the Northeast as as you know one step below MIT in a since you know so it's got big name recognition in this area a big science school no football team but a big science school and technical people know that yeah yeah but i don't yeah i think you're right you really have to think about that for the job i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's and when i now i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs i was going to be a teacher i was just a high school teacher so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of you know but then when i went um yeah for graduate work you know or for a new job people said to me you know Shippensburg State where is that you know and you know when i went into higher education even at other universities they weren't aware of it you know yeah yeah yeah so i think yeah that's important um i think it depends on if you want to be a if you want a regional job or a national job you need that first job or so out of school too yeah yeah i i guess another thing that concerns me is uh so many people it seems like everybody today is still in that job market and uh um where was i at oh going in going to school you get taught the things you learn in school but there is also a whole other dimension i mean the growing up while you're going to school part um-hum yeah and uh actually in the Midwest especially a lot of the schools have like University of Missouri will have a main campus like Columbia which is big multi disciplinary and they'll have a satellite campus in a usually in a smaller town right that specializes in the technical field so you've really uh i guess sacrificed some social exposure to different groups and everything um-hum right yeah depending on your technical areas yeah i could see that but you know at some of the large schools i know that at at at University of Maryland where i am you know in a PhD program i i haven't even met uh someone outside of yeah my area of information systems except for  yeah yes i talked with um i talked with people from Richardson and Plano and uh the first three days and then yesterday i talked with someone with from Pennsylvania so it's the yeah because i've only been made this is only my third call i i tried to make calls two different days and i couldn't get through oh oh i know sometimes i just i'm in it just takes a very long time so does it yeah i've been trying to you know do that and and sometimes i just can't wait that long so i just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again yeah i know well this is hilarious oh well tell me what books have you read lately but i knew as soon as i heard your voice i thought Kathy's it's Kathy Kenser well well let's see i um gosh i can't even think i haven't read any and you're such a reader i know that and i well i don't read all that much for enjoyment i mean i read a lot for school but gee i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading yeah the the last book i picked up was a book by Judy Bloom and it was um it was called um Smart Women i think uh-huh um um or something like that and it was it was kind of i really didn't like it at all it was it was written back in the early eighties and it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the yeah huh oh yeah oh yeah um it was almost like a a pre AIDS scare kind of thing interesting it was really an interesting because i i right away looked at when it was copyrighted uh-huh because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written yes yes yeah and it was all about women searching for themselves um-hum and um you know a lot of hanky-panky going on yeah yeah that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for when when a lot of books like that were coming out i think that's right and so that makes real sense that that's um when it was written um i haven't wasn't really aware that she had written anything for um adults i was always just more aware of her journal you know for her young people her books uh-huh yeah yeah um-hum yeah and she's more famous for that but she has been writing for adults also and so i thought hey i'll just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um the style was very conversational i'll be darned yeah uh-huh you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description yeah right yeah yeah you know how that is and and um yeah i wonder if she's written anything really recently if she's got anything printed in print yeah she has because i i remember seeing a new book by her that was out and i think it was a it was an adult book uh-huh i'll be darned so anyway but that's the last thing i i've read and um yeah yeah well it's i'm trying to think the last actual book i read that wasn't let's see i think i read oh when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer and you know on semester break between spring and summer yeah and i went to my mother's i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school i read um Jane Eyre no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Jane Eyre no no no no it wasn't Jane Eyre no it was um i Wuthering Heights uh Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen that's what it was yes and um you know i i didn't know what to expect except i had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and oh yeah by Jane Austen yes yes she really was good i mean i was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately and um um-hum and you know i just but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then yeah because i i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college but i don't remember it and then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone i think it was um um-hum yeah yeah uh-huh oh some actress reading it you know they had an abridged version of it on tape and so i got that for her and she loved doing that but i remember that was the book oh how interesting yes oh i'll bet yeah yeah and now i i mean i think it's around here somewhere i'm just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it right i wouldn't be surprised yeah sure oh yeah well i read that and then i'm trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that i'm going to do but um um-hum when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while um yeah oh that's what i do too yeah and that's about it because otherwise i'm reading so much for school i'm um i have just started reading a book actually it's for school but it's for um there's a a literary journal well not a literary journal it's a it's kind of a journal of of the history of ideas that's that's starting to be published um from UTD the first issue doesn't come out until next year but um i'm doing some reviews of books just to oh yeah what to sort of recommend to whether whether or not a full-scale review should be done for the journal and i've yeah it's really neat because these are brand new books and i just got a i got a this this one oh how neat oh great um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that this one is on Johann Sebastian Bach and it's a a biography a biography um-hum um-hum oh great that is really interesting i mean it it's fascinating it really is um but it's so long i i don't really have the time to read the whole thing but i think eventually i'll go back to it but it oh that's fascinating oh yeah yeah it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so it's a brand new book yeah uh-huh yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um oh it's a brand new book oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that yeah some aspects of of Bach's genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians yeah that's right yes yeah and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other yes uh-huh and um yeah that's the way it was i'm sure back then yeah oh that's interesting yeah yeah so um it was just really interesting if that's you know that's kind of what but i have to not only am am i reading reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesn't have right now doesn't have a really respected name um who's a um a scholar on on music um and i'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board so um-hum oh yeah i don't know if i want to take that responsibility or not but but at least i can tell them what i think so um it's real interesting wow that's rough that's real rough yeah well that's a neat thing to be involved in because i think our i think my alma mater um Gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine yeah it is uh-huh that was similar to that i think that's probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges but um yeah yeah yes yeah that it you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uh-huh because it attracts really a a lot people's interest that's one way it's really good public relations for small schools i think so um-hum yeah oh yes yeah but uh another one of my projects this summer is actually it's part of my research assistantship is um it's helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that he's writing oh and so i'm learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people now translations what do you mean translations of of um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people and the translations are all so different from one another um-hum yeah um-hum oh i see all different oh that's interesting so it's multiple translations of single works and and that's right now right now pretty much what i'm doing as far as um my work is just kind of compiling all that for him so gosh that's great it's real interesting boy you really lift me up to a different i mean here i i'm dealing with uh cleaning the stove and you know i'm i wish i were dealing with Baudelaire that would be nice but i oh well let me tell you there are days when i would be prefer really doing that i don't know if i've told you but um this is not on the subject  on my father's side we've really there uh does your family normally have a reunion do you have one that's been on my father's side we've really there uh on my mother's side we've had several not it's not really on a regular basis but usually sometimes every few summers uh-huh uh-huh well see all the family lives in one place except for a few of us that are scattered about so they're pretty much just reunited always so it's it's right um-hum just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together uh-huh well it might be a good time for you to begin to to start a tradition you could be responsible for that yourself i know that's they do that that's true how about your family sure well in my family let's see last October was the forty fifth annual uh reunion the first Sunday in October the Jordan family gets together wow you're a pro at this oh that's good and all of the descendants of the Civil War i mean yeah the Civil War veteran come together and they come as far away as from California and there's usually oh between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people and then where do you meet in uh there's a big community hall in Vernon okay Texas and uh that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family okay do you have relatives in Vernon uh-huh then okay right uh-huh a lot of the older family lives in Vernon um all of his direct descendants descendants have now died and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties right oh so we're talking about second and third great children here right uh i take my boys well i took them up till this year they're grown and gone from home now so they take their family but uh oh right but uh let's see that would make them grandfather great grandfather great great grandfather okay so it would be the second great grandchild okay so this town hall that you meet in is that like a um it's uh well it's a community center it's a community hall it's a great big open building that has a wonderful kitchen in it okay and uh you just bring the covered dishes every every family brings a a dish of some kind and you get all the wonderful old family recipes that have been handed down for years potato salad and the well we try to stay away from those things which might have uh salmonella in them oh that's good and we choose to bring congealed salad you can bring a congealed vegetable salad as opposed to potato salad and we are very conscious of most of us are very conscious of of uh right sanitation aspects whatever you've got to carry for any distance i always take home baked bread right huh oh that's nice oh that's nice uh that happens to be my specialty for that family i do other things very well but there are others in the family who do them better do they always have the the one person in the family who knows or everyone thinks they know how to make this the best and that's what they get to cook uh-huh that's good well i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions so i learned a lot about them i haven't been to a lot but we talked a lot about the the rituals you she equated the family reunion with the Protestant um-hum um-hum um-hum it was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage it was it was an interesting theory she talked about the um um-hum that Catholics all it's a home centered you know it's all family centered anyway so you usually are living where your parents live and it's all your you don't have to come home so the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe but when the Protestant ethic happened in America there were people who ever went out and you know went away from the family to seek their fortune and then had to come back home um-hum for the reunion so that became their version of the pilgrimage um-hum right but she had it was interesting you know i don't know how valid it is but she talked about that and how the the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together and um you know about the bread and the ritual placement do you have a a certain way that everything's placed out on the table every every year is there kind of a you know salads go first and things like that well it's uh we have uh uh kind of a core group that that serves as quote officers of the organization and they plan the reunions they right organize the you know who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there who's going to rent the tables who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer uh and each year it's done a little bit differently because different people serve in those roles that's pretty fancy we have a biographer who who continues every year to save clippings on any family member and they're entered into a a wonderful uh scrap book and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and and obituaries to those who are gone And it keeps the family alive even you know even though it's very fluid and they're very dedicated to that sure does that's wonderful it's been really wonderful it helps you hang on to your roots yeah i wish we'd and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging my husband on the other hand was not very close to his family his family was very scattered and very diverse right and i asked him i got to talking to him i said well how is his nephew doing well i don't know i haven't talked to my brother in three years well how's your brother doing i don't know um you know my son keeps in touch with him i think but i don't i said hey wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people yeah but i'm you know it's too much trouble right so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one wow you're just uh oh that's incredible to our place down at Lake Tawakoni liked to kill me because i had it was i didn't have that group cooperation i did it by myself right and uh nobody brought covered dishes we had a great big fish fry and you know i fixed a salad in a number three tub and and uh right it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping and uh we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them and i told him have you have you done this repetitively or just once we did it that year and then the following summer we did not have all of the family there we sent invitations we said please let us know if you're coming it was when uh his mother his step father had died the year before his mother was alone and so they came to support her and then one by one his brothers you know his sisters he began to lose family members see that's we've we had a problem with that and it was difficult to hold them together and then of course he died t wo years ago so and you know that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now oh and uh it i think that's what happens when they get scattered the the family unit you know falls into disrepair right that's what was our problem we had uh the first reunion or the first you know major reunion was probably six or seven years ago and then the second reunion people who maybe you know um-hum sacrifice things to come to the first one though oh well it's not that big a thing this year and so it kind of wound down and then finally uh-hum um-hum you're lucky to get the Shreveport relatives there but no one else uh-huh well see we manage those people who are at that core group manage to keep keep the vigor alive they'll send out news bulletins two or three times a year you'll get a news bulletin hey guess who got shows up you know elected to the legislature or guess who's our local sheriff  uh-huh um i guess we're supposed to talk about music okay and uh let me go ahead and push one here uh do you have are you a musician yourself uh well i sing i don't play an instrument though uh-huh uh-huh where do you sing in in a choir or a choral group oh not right now uh-huh what kind of singing do you like to do oh pretty much anything yeah uh-huh Um are you uh are are have you have you been singing a long time or have you studied uh-huh oh yeah a long time out all through college and everything i was in the choirs right and i've had some classical vocal training um-hum oh really oh great did did you do that in uh Texas or somewhere else no i was in Europe oh whereabouts in uh in Germany uh-huh oh that's wonderful um well i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs and then i didn't sing in a choral group um until after i was uh married and i sang in a couple of uh community choirs and then um waited for a while and now i've for about the last eight years i've sung in a church choir here in Texas and um oh yeah so i i enjoy just the chorals singing a lot as well Um are you a soprano alto or um-hum soprano a soprano yeah so am i do you and uh what kind of music do you like to sing um you were saying you had classical training do you have a particular composer that you like or a particular type oh well as far as opera goes i'm i think most fond of Verdi uh-huh i've been listening to um some um some advertisements for Madam Butterfly and i'm wondering if you if you have ever done anything like that have you ever done any uh if if you had done Madam Butterfly no no i haven't done um i'd love to but yes um that's uh Puccini i think right uh-huh yes uh-huh um Madam Butterfly was um in Dallas it's been two or three years ago now and then i went to see that and it was really wonderful it was particularly well the acting was particularly nice i thought and um um-hum yeah so it was quite popular um you don't play um an instrument so ah no uh um have you ever wanted to like guitar or piano or uh i think it would be nice if i played the piano yeah yeah that i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does you know some other kind of instrument i think piano is always good background beginner Um uh-huh i played piano all through well i guess from the time i was five five until i graduated from college and uh then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school so um that was the instrument both of my children started on but neither of them stayed with it um-hum one of them um turned into a violinist and the other one is the boy is um guitar and and percussion so um um-hum but the i i think that the piano background is very um useful and um i'm sure that it for you it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself just for practicing and so on oh yeah uh-huh do you have any other kind of music that you like um oh i like to listen to all different kinds of music um-hum i have a i used to work with a fellow who had um although this was a computer company he had his uh PhD in musical uh i guess it was in composition actually from University of North Texas and uh when i would go into his his office every now and then you never knew what kind of music he'd be playing on the radio It may be country it might be classical it might be rock you know it was just he said that that just about what you said that he just liked all kinds of music um-hum yeah and that was that was neat for for me to hear that somebody is there's you know some of the really totally country stuff i don't really particularly like but yeah yeah um do you have any plans to uh do anything with your music in the near future or well i have i have like we i wish i could but i i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree or um-hum yeah um i know that there are if you're interested in choral singing i'm not sure where you are in Texas but i do know that some communities have uh uh community choruses and uh that's often a good way to get back into it again um it's not really terribly demanding you might have to audition but that probably wouldn't be a problem but um uh-huh there usually you know that they take tours and things like that and you get to know you know people um socially as well as as in a musical setting so that's always fun i think that's um-hum yeah well that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much is that not only do we sing wonderful music but we've gotten to know each other quite well um in on a a social level and i think we sing better because of that i think you know i think we sing more like uh um-hum that's good people who trust each other which is really nice uh-huh yeah so whereabouts in Texas are you if i could ask oh i'm in Flower Mound uh-huh Flower Mound okay well i'm in Plano so um we're just not too far apart actually yeah that's pretty close uh-huh it was funny um um it's you know i talk to people all over uh Texas um and only one person outside of the country uh of the state so i'm always asking where where in the state you know the person is from if they're in Texas yeah um are do you have a family um i'm married uh-huh i was wondering if your if your spouse or if you know if you had uh other musical people in your family i'm sorry uh if you have other people in your family who are also musical oh a little bit uh-huh do you come by it naturally was your were your parents that musical yeah yeah that often is the case um yeah i think so the you know it's it sometimes it will skip like my husband is not musical at all but his mother is very musical and um and his children are very musical so you never know where the talent is going to show up i guess sometimes so um well i'm not sure how long we've talked i haven't paid haven't been paying attention to the to the clock but uh i think i'll bet we've done we've done at least five minutes probably well i 've enjoyed talking with you uh Becky and um maybe we'll talk again uh-huh bye-bye okay all right thanks bye-bye  okay okay where have you all been on vacation recently recently my most recent trip was last year and that was Detroit Detroit is that a nice vacation spot yeah well it wasn't really it was um uh to see an old relative right okay and it was uh just to uh have some fellowship with her right so you probably wouldn't recommend that as tourist big tourist spot no The only thing that i i visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico ooh that would be nice and that was real nice uh did you scuba dive there uh no we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there ooh that would be nice yeah and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine oh that would be enjoyable right yeah that's a nice break i haven't been on vacation in a while either um usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area which is up kind of near Denver huh uh-huh yes and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing oh that's always refreshing to get away from so it's a lot of fun i worked up there last summer so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long oh well that's nice yeah worked at a camp there and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation well my uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity and that's canoeing oh and uh they've been to the Guadalupe River and they also uh uh have been to uh i guess Colorado and they've really enjoyed it it's a whole new that's nice we um we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River uh-huh and that's the best place that i've ever canoed it was really huh really pretty i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about mountain things you know i think he wasn't a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in sure uh-huh the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to we'd and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and oh that's neat that's that's a good family place to go and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too sure frightening but it wasn't uh-huh you know too easy either so it was like well you learn a lot of um skills too and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older to learn new skills and i think they really it really penetrates penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it that's true um-hum because it's something you weren't forced to do right so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning and you're more receptive yeah well that's good well we um let's see the only other place i've ever vacationed we'd you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that uh-huh and then i went to England oh that's exciting a few years ago i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London uh-huh uh-huh and that was a great time because it's so that's such a neat place and it's there's not a language barrier so you don't i mean there there's a little bit because there's some of those English words that you just don't exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but it's it was really fun i i i really enjoyed that i'm probably going back there to work for a year uh-huh well i had a friend that uh visited England not well i think it's been probably two years now but that's her next goal and she can do it is go back to England because she really has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it it it's really nice i would i would spend all my time in London or most of my time and that's it was really different being in a big city because i don't uh-huh get much into urban you know really urban areas a lot uh-huh uh-huh and it was it's really it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone uh-huh uh-huh you could just kind of do your own thing kind of walk around and observe i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching watching people yeah uh-huh and i had a great time doing that it was really interesting that's wonderful there's a lot out there to see i'll say yeah i know i keep wanting to get up to i haven't i haven't been anywhere else outside the United States i haven't been to Mexico or Canada or well i lived across the street almost from Canada oh so that was that that's a nice place Canada is very nice yeah that would be nice i had a friend from there then i i'd love to go somewhere in Asia but i'd have to have a uh-huh tour guide with me to oh yes absolutely help with all the language and all that sure somebody that knows their way around so yeah that's why that's why England was nice even we traveled in Europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasn't uh the most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and well you've been quite a few places there well i yeah we have we just kind of once you think about it huh we did we whirlwinded through Europe it was uh-huh just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night oh that's great but there wasn't a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasn't ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland knew English uh-huh that's great so we were kind of pitiful we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no on e knew English in there and we were just uh-huh finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was uh what did you wind up with oh i had fondue that was easy to say oh okay tried to get fondue and white wine and that was uh uh-huh we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly there were some people at the next table who spoke English so we they kind of guided you elicited their aid for a while and they were uh-huh very helpful so well good it was it was a pleasant time i'd i'd love to go back there there's just not time there's not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time we'll have the the means to uh pursue our dreams right yeah i guess that's what retirement is all about that's that and sleeping late Yes i keep hoping for uh-huh i understand that huh well it was nice talking with you well it was nice talking with you too Craig and have a good afternoon you do the same thank you bye-bye okay good-bye  okay i'm back on okay um you say you watch evenings mostly i watch evenings because i work all day i used to watch daytimes um mainly like All My Children that kind of thing um-hum oh so and then sometimes Oprah and sometimes Donahue but now it's mainly evenings do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there yes which ones i tape Thirty Something and L A Law those are the two i like the best oh that's a oh two they're going to change well one they're taking off i don't know what's going to happen yeah we like L A Law we don't watch Thirty Something but that's kind of young for us my husband and i are grandparents so we don't watch uh i know it's going to be history i know uh-huh oh well well that type of show but we like L A Law we like that we're just i'm sorry they're breaking the team up because we liked all the ones that were on there uh-huh i know i'm amazed i'm not sure i like the new ones too much huh-uh i'm surprised that i was surprised at the ending of you know with all the funny things happening and different things i just wonder if if uh they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show since it's gone on for so long it looks like it looks like it might be one of these seven or eight year run things uh-huh uh-huh where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess that's not bad Alan Alda did it on MASH and i know i know isn't that funny it hasn't hurt him at all so do you do you mostly like this type of like a story type of thing that lasts an hour oh i don't usually like stuff that continues that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows because usually i like you know stuff that just ends sort of that you just you don't have to have watched you know in one hour like Quantum Leap that's one of our favorites yeah i mean you don't have to yeah you don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow so right which they do at the beginning of the season to grab your attention you know i usually don't like that uh-huh yeah that's always a bummer too sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one i know uh-huh we we do that sometimes i i guess i'm i'm not into real heavy stuff L A Law is about the heaviest thing i watch i i'll mostly i'm into it for relaxation yeah yeah so i like things like Golden Girls or Cheers or uh Monday night is real good with me you know Major Dad and and uh uh Northern Exposure and and uh oh what's that one with Burt Reynolds that type of show is what we what uh we watch we generally just stay on one channel all for all of Monday night just to watch those uh-huh just uh some of the times they're continued but mostly they're just little vignettes a new one we found we really like is that Dinosaurs have you seen that that is it's it's really funny they use huh like animated it's not like a cartoon but it's like dummies and things that are used and uh it's really um and robots probably but uh there's always a a moral to each story uh-huh and what night is it on well you we watched it the times we've seen it it's been like on Saturday or excuse me Friday night uh but it's we've only seen it a couple of times but it it's real the first one we saw um uh they were uh it it involved a tradition of when a person person reaches seventy five uh and i can't remember what day they call it but but uh the son-in-laws get to throw the mother-in-laws when they're seventy five over a cliff anyway oh great anyway it it goes on you know and the son-in-law and mother-in-law are sniping at each other and all and then when it comes time for him to throw her over well the the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her oh and she said no you can't do you know he ran her out was running to hide in a wheelchair to hide her and she said you can't do that uh this is huh tradition this is what old people are supposed to be thrown over the the cliff and uh he said i don't understand it's it's real funny that they give the teenagers the as the one that questions um the what's going on and uh in the end of uh the son-in-law when he did get the mother-in-law up to the cliff uh uh-huh the the son the teenaged son throws himself in the way and says no you can't do it and then and then uh oh well we've got to do it it's tradition and the son was you know why and so in in the end he doesn't throw her over and of course the town thinks he's just terrible uh-huh oh he doesn't because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it and then we saw one where this there was a teenage when a boy teenage boy comes into his manhood they call it the night of the howling or something like that and they all go out and howl you know um-hum and and the son refused to do it he he did he thought it was not no he wouldn't go howl so all the all the people that worked with the father ostracized him so he didn't go howl oh how funny it is it it it's it's real interesting to watch the show and and what the relationship between the family is is really now the mother-in-law huh now the mother-in-law lives in the house with them so it's our our grandson our oldest grandson is the one that that got us to watching it but it really is it moves real fast it's a real short and there's always like i say a moral to it and right half hour that that's all there is to it and and uh they it's just a half hour or is it hour oh there's not many half hour shows it seems like that much yeah it's it they they're trying to liken the the father in there of the teenage son to like Jackie Gleason Show uh uh-huh the way he talks to his mother-in-law and so forth and i guess maybe there are some parts of that but i didn't really see that in there but what i've read about it they talk about that but anyway we've we've enjoyed that and and uh i guess mostly i i like the news shows too and the news magazines like Sixty seconds Minutes or Twenty Twenty or yeah no i watch those if i around Prime Time Live or something like that you know all all of those shows if i if i can do it but my husband likes to watch uh old movies especially war movies or or uh sports which i'm not oh see i like sports no i don't well i i do i like ice skating and i like uh gymnastics um-hum and some track and field but i i and i'll watch snippets of baseball games and i i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing uh-huh and i don't ever no matter what's on i don't ever just sit and watch TV i'm usually either doing dishes or i may be sewing or you know i always have or letter writing or i may be working around in the room somehow but i don't i know i don't ever just sit and i that's something that comes from your old age you know idle hands are the devil's workshop no it's it's uh no i don't sit i know who has time i don't have time to sit i know that's why i don't get to watch that much i mean i watch nine o'clock i do okay because the kids are all in bed but before that i really there's not much time or like at six thirty i'll watch Wheel of Fortune or something like that right right right well our yeah if our grandchildren if our grandchildren are with us that's they have to watch that we don't watch it unless they're here but they uh uh-huh no i like that no i'll watch game show kind of stuff but it's it's um oh and you know the the kids will get you started on stuff like America's Funniest Home Videos we've wound up sending in one that's something i didn't think that we'd ever do yeah did you send one yeah our oldest grandson pulling his tooth he's he's he wouldn't let us pull it and i mean it it got to the point he was eating a pear here and he bit into it and it was just hanging by a thread how funny and i and i'd tell him you know it's getting ready to fall out and he walked around the house with his face face down toward the floor and his mouth open hoping it would fall out because he wouldn't let anybody pull it uh and he wound he wound up pull  yes um i i think that Plano has really done a fantastic job i mean at least their plans have are good um how however i was maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um they've had some problems with the recycling on plastic uh-huh i thought that was most interesting that with the plastic well i just i thought it was sad that they it started out as a good program yeah but then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there and i and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didn't want to set at the curb or take to the dump and and uh yes yeah that's right yeah i guess that's going to happen i it's too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing yeah a really good effort that's right yeah but uh well i was thinking about the other day um when i when Dick and i were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri um i went oh i was probably this was probably see it been like nineteen sixty seven or sixty eight um we i went to a meeting and uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling and um she was from Saint Louis and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling hum and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum and i thought wow i mean how one person is doing that you know but my my thought was oh it's a shame i mean it's wonderful that she's doing it and it but wouldn't it be much much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are you know now we're doing it on a city wide basis in in communities so it's wonderful that we've come that far i think but doing it what did she do with if if she was she like a group that was doing it or was she doing it on her own and what did she do with the um i think she was i was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself uh-huh uh-huh uh and so it wasn't you know something that was being picked up or um and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and i thought wow that's that is wonderful that somebody is doing that does that yeah you you have to really want to do it though this is even even what you recycle because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper uh-huh right yes and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too but um sure you do uh-huh a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure it's that and you have to it's uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans yeah uh-huh isn't that amazing and i thought what are you complaining about well you know when you're only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week and yes people i don't know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort yeah i don't know it's it's i understand i know what you're saying kind of people like that and rather than work with it yeah well it's for everybody's benefit i mean it's it's not so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime but we you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren and well sure it is yep yeah it's on down the line what kind of quality of life are you leaving them and and the and i have a real concern about that uh right yes yeah i agree when we've never had much trash because while while i was raised in a big family and and Gene's family wasn't big but they weren't rich uh-huh yeah and they had to to recycle and and you know the food well they didn't they just used things they didn't throw things away before they were used up and sure yeah right yeah well i know um i guess i got a good example from my mother because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things and she is to this day and you know i mean she'll even um if she uh-huh for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something she'd use that yeah right she just she recycles everything and i have done the same thing i recycle like zip lock bags and things like that my kids get the biggest kick out of that although right they do the same thing i mean they i think they give me a hard time but i think they know that that's it's the right way right they've picked up the habit well they do and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things uh-huh yes and they appreciate how much it costs to do that then and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that and pretty soon they're they're figuring out that's not such a bad way to go but yeah that's right that's true yeah well i don't know you know i i wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work i mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know some people are complaining now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside you know and i think golly Moses you just do your part you know people are not you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always have work out out right well see this this is what concerns me you over in Europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here no that's right you you've got to be in a country even in in Mexico you don't see things thrown away like we do here uh-huh right yeah yeah i mean what we throw away is is a ransom a king's ransom to most people and i and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and yes uh-huh yeah yeah yeah and and i i think you have to get into a period of need before you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house uh-huh that have all that they need and all that they could want that they've got to be careful this is uh i this is why i thought Jimmy Carter was never very popular very positive you know uh-huh uh-huh no uh people didn't like him uh-huh because he tried to say turn off the lights conserve this do that and and uh the people i nob ody wanted to hear it yeah yeah right do those little things yeah that make a lot of difference uh-huh yeah yeah it's i you know and i think you're right though i think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes or you have to grow up with it being important important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes and it's it's uh uh-huh uh-huh um i don't know it's uh it's just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am than i even myself than i used to be a few years ago i mean like i i'd go to the um to the UTD um cafeteria for lunch sometimes right uh-huh and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldn't need to use styrofoam plates um right you know and i think to myself that's that's crazy i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention you know and and uh-huh uh-huh uh i'm seeing more and more of that and and i think it's uh just McDonald's effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff i think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it right huh i i think the big question too we're looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled yeah well i think that may that's kind of what it's coming to i'm sure it um that's that's right and and uh yeah do we have to wait until all the landfills are full oh yeah and there is nowhere else to put our garbage or and i don't with the mind set that's right yeah of the American public i think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash uh-huh wow that doesn't wouldn't surprise me uh-huh that isn't that isn't harmful or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean yeah yeah uh that's the way we solve problems and it's sad i know it and unfortunately  Lynn do you do you want to start certainly um okay do you want to tell me about some of the vacations you've taken or well i i tend to uh take two kinds of vacations the vacations to visit family and the vacations to just have a week being cultural and going to the theater and doing sightseeing and things like that uh-huh which is your favorite oh well i couldn't live without the family vacations but uh my favorite is the the indulgent ones where we go off and and uh see places that have interested me since i was a kid for the most part uh-huh and uh your your family doesn't live close then uh not anymore they uh they've been in San Diego for the last few years and they're moving to Florida okay and that's one of those things you just have to go once a year yep i understand so uh basically it it sorts out into that and then once about once every three or four years i try to get over to England because i lived there for a while wow some years back i've only only been there once oh i'd love to go back beautiful country beautiful country beautiful people it was yeah it we had a great time but uh and i'd real really like to go because um i'm fairly recently married and and my husband has been hearing about these people for years and uh but he's never met them so uh i'd like i'd like to do that but anyway that's that's our typical vacation and uh we enjoy the family vacations but the other ones are very special getaways and we probably take one of each every year how about yourself well we we as you do take family vacations uh sometimes one a year and but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons but vacations we really enjoy i think we've been on three cruises oh i've never been on a cruise and we we really love cruises we've gone on Carnival Cruise Lines uh-huh and uh we've gone fairly inexpensive from as most cruises go uh we usually book just a month before it's ready to go yeah and we get upgraded last time last two times in fact we had an outside room and it was beautiful um and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around it's kind of well what do you do on a cruise i've never been on a cruise oh my God you do everything you i mean you can be as busy as you want to be or as laid back as you want to be you can sit in the sun all day around the pool or you can take part in the games that they have going on they always have bingo they have a casino uh they have a massage parlor they have exercise i mean you can do anything huh and that's just aboard ship and then when the ship docks you get to go sight seeing and shopping and that's quite fun uh-huh uh-huh and where have you been on these cruises uh Nassau San Juan Saint Thomas we've been there twice we went two cruises that hit those islands but with different people we we've gone with friends each time i see and then we went to uh the western Caribbean which is uh Port uh Cancun Cozumel oh the the Mexican coast and Ocho Rios pardon me i the that's all Mexico i think yes uh-huh and but it was wonderful so we really like those and uh i guess we just like to go someplace someplace entirely different we've been to a few places in this country we still have a lot to see though where are you from originally we're from Illinois originally uh-huh and we've been down in Texas eighteen years and so like you we we always try to make it you know back home to see the relatives we both still have family there uh-huh and that's fun it brings back a lot of memories oh yes uh things are different there though they're uh i don't know it's just entirely different world than this area well i i grew up in Dallas so i mean it's not it's not like i'm going home my my parents retired first to San Diego and they're going now to Florida and so they're going very nice places thank God did you uh-huh uh-huh that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know i really came to love San Diego and feel very comfortable there they've been there eight years uh-huh and uh you know i just grab the car and drive everywhere oh that's great so it it is it is nice but it's not home this is home and um and i've never thought about a cruise it's so funny oh they they they really are we've yeah as i said we've done them three times we'd be going again this this year if circumstances hadn't changed we we'd probably go my husband would you know the minute i said the word he he he's chomping at the bit uh-huh he kind of likes the casinos a little bit uh-huh but i like all of it and what's the best part from your point of view i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places um-hum i like shopping i can shop anyplace shop in London and France and wherever now my kids are moving to Toronto so we're going to be able to go up there oh that'll be nice so i'm kind of looking forward to that except i hate to see them go oh sure but sure well go in don't go in the winter oh that's what everybody says and i i think it's i think i'll try to stay away except my my second grandchild will be born in in the winter in January oh so that will be hard to stay away from well there there are exceptions made for special occasions like that yeah but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer so isn't that the truth uh-huh hum well that sounds wonderful well i i guess i i would contemplate going on a cruise uh oh all circumstances permitting it well there's all age group groups too and that's that's kind of fun uh you if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals you meet different people you may meet people you know thirty years older than you or younger and uh-huh everybody is really interesting and everybody is there to have a good time and huh how long are the cruises and uh we've only gone on the seven day cruises uh-huh they have shorter ones and then they have ten day ones but i think seven days is long enough for us by that time we're ready to get home and get ba ck to our routine i think most vacations uh seven days is enough for us we've gone i think when we went to England and France we were there ten twelve days and that was pushing it a bit yeah yeah uh i tend when when i spend enough money to go overseas i go for a long time yeah well that that makes sense it really does i mean oh we went to Panama too oh that's interesting went to Panama last August uh-huh our son-in-law is from Panama oh and uh he we went with our daughter and son-in-law to visit his parents who live there and his father is a a doctor and his mother is a kindergarten teacher and they took time off it was uh-huh their winter and they were having a little break so they took some time off that uh they could show us around and it it is a beautiful country it is beautiful they have mountains we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore huh that's really nice and it it is gorgeous they live in a small town called David which is northern Panama up near Costa Rica uh-huh and uh it's it's just it's just a gorgeous country most people don't realize it i think if they could get tourists coming to their country they'd improve the economy considerably huh well may maybe now things are calming down again that will happen yeah we really hope hope so well that that's really great um yeah i i mean as i said well well basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents and uh well that that's that's pretty good that's pretty good and and uh we had my husband had a conference in LA so we spent a week in LA and of course oh do you like LA uh i'm very i'm i'm very unusual i like  well well Pat have did you vote in the last election most assuredly oh you did yes ma'am i've voted in every major election since i turned twenty one oh that's great well why do you think people don't don't always vote for somebody i sometimes vote against somebody that makes sense too i think that a lot of it is uh i know that my late husband was simply indifferent he didn't feel like he had any say there was too many people too many other votes for example uh you know he'd say well look you and i see different sides of the fence if i go vote you'll cancel my vote i said i sure will he said so i just won't vote i said then mine counts because you could cancel mine too and then does yeah i think i think that's a lot of people just indifferent i know that i've moved around a lot in the past um three years i've had three different addresses each time i change jurisdictions or whatever uh-huh uh-huh sure so i just haven't because i mean graduate school or whatever so i haven't kept track of it i did when i lived steadily in one community i always i voted uh-huh but this past time i didn't well actually i voted it for the presidential election but then i didn't vote uh i guess in the two year for uh some legislators and things and uh-huh well characteristically in some in the local elections uh-huh typically those people who vote are those who feel very strongly about an issue right uh-huh if i do not feel very strongly about an issue then i see no reason to go vote uh-huh right yeah and that's probably one reason why i voted in the the last election but not really this one because this one really didn't matter that much uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah it's probably true well of course of course listening to government the instructors you'll find out that everything matters but then you could go crazy worrying about everything well you know they also say that most people vote their local politics that that local is far much more important than uh national issues well that's the way you get to national and that's the way you make changes about your neighborhood uh-huh right oh i definitely think so uh i know that i have been involved in preparing and in in uh carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place even something so simple as getting a street light uh-huh in between lights on the end of the block but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over in the dark and uh right uh-huh yeah that's true yeah it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take that kind of action and that's completely unnecessary In another particular case they were trying to uh-huh put in a um senior citizen's home uh-huh in in an area very near our neighborhood but if you just cross that major street the character of the neighborhood changes and it's less savory uh-huh okay and that i was just very i felt very strongly about that those people simply did not have access to safety to security and they were at risk uh-huh and it was for elderly people who lived alone and they were going to put a cluster of of houses there for them but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety no most now that's true and all it all it did was to in my judgment make them easier targets uh-huh yeah easier targets and so we we did get a petition together and we very strongly resisted it and prepare them to be victims yes yeah and it was placed in a actually it was placed clear closer to my neighborhood but it was on the right side of the street uh-huh right side of the tracks yeah and uh it it i think that they're they're much more comfortable there uh-huh did they uh i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood although we have a good crime watch program but it's it's very serious just across the street uh-huh yeah did um did you think i know that Texas's last gubernatorial uh election probably brought out a lot of voters well did that did that seem to because that really that got national attention national attention i guess having a woman governor running against a man and whatever well no i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier uh-huh and that's it it was a dirty election people were calling each other uh names and every bit of the trash it was a it was a dirty campaign yeah it was a dirty mud slinging campaign well you know what's funny up here uh i live i see a lot of Virginia news and i guess uh uh-huh Senator Robb and Governor Wilder are active right here and they have some type of wire tapping problem going on and the people in Virginia are complaining see Robb is married to Lynda Bird Johnson uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and the people in Virginia are complaining that he is he's using Texas politics in Virginia and they're really complaining big time because they said that we don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in Texas all the time uh-huh so you you guys were getting well of course now that's not all the time we've had some pretty yeah you were getting slandered i think we were having some pretty healthy uh campaigns that were based on issues there for two or three of the gubernatorial races but i historically Texas has had uh-huh uh-huh mud and muddier campaigns i mean it's just i think that eventually you know the better people have sensibilities and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage unfortunately that's not always the way it should be yeah uh-huh you don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage you want to do the one who can do the most good do the most good yeah that's true and uh i guess that's why i know that um i'm previously from Pennsylvania and Dick Thornburg who's now the attorney general is going to run for senator because uh John Heinz a senator from Pennsylvania died in an airplane crash uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide Dick Thornburg into as into the senate uh-huh because they don't like the governor the governor's political appointee or whatever and they're almost expecting landslide uh-huh uh-huh out uh turn out right now for for that election okay so you so you see that's very negative motivation isn't it uh-huh yeah isn't that too bad we really could use a little positive motivation hey we think this guy can really make some changes and we're going to support him that was true in a lot of cases in in a couple of the older sixties campaigns uh-huh yeah uh-huh uh what in Texas was that when you no i'm talking about national campaigns yeah uh even when John Kennedy was elected there were so many strikes against him but there were people who believed he could make a difference now that's that's true yeah right that's not to say what has transpired or what really was i'm saying that's how it was perceived uh-huh that's right that's perception that's true and uh because the those were big political that was a big um turn out election oh yeah absolutely and and it was people going to vote for i think more than those who voted against uh-huh uh-huh i know i know that in my own uh area of people whom i knew and how they were going to vote they didn't go to vote against uh a politician as they did a little bit later when Nixon was running they went to vote against the less of lesser of the two evils in certain cases uh-huh yeah but i think that one was one that you had some very strong feelings among people and they voted their convictions uh-huh uh-huh well i think that also happened with Ronald Reagan absolutely you're right he was he was landslided in and people really saw that was um-hum  Americans Americans like me and whether or not uh uh uh not i think that we're paying too much taxes um that including taxes in general or income tax and um the other thing was do we get what we pay for i mean what what is our what is our opinion on that so okay are you prepared to talk let me push oh i guess so go by ear let me push one here okay okay um well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in Texas it's most interesting because we're one of the few if i don't know of any other state um does not have a state and so we don't have a state income tax but we certainly make up for it in other ways here um for instance the local um sales tax is eight and a quarter percent right oh wow isn't that awful how about you what do you have there uh we have a six percent sales tax uh-huh and you have state income tax also yes um-hum yeah well it's been people here have just have this um they've been really holding out in the legislature and it's starting to show um in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded and and i don't know if Texas is ever going to be able to to um totally avoid having an income tax or not i think eventually they're going to have to do it uh-huh but um do you think you pay too much there or how do you feel about that i don't mind my taxes as much as my social security oh really interesting uh-huh yeah yeah um the taxes i don't know i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in too i guess you know yeah yes but uh oh i don't know uh the one thing that we don't have uh tax on clothes do you uh-huh um yes we do have tax on clothes that's what i thought i know New York has also has a sales tax on clothes uh-huh and i know a lot of kids like going to college with me that lived in New York or out of state and a lot of them would buy their clothes in Pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that how interesting i guess i didn't realize that um we don't have tax on groceries for instance um uh-huh no well we don't have it necessarily on food but then there's other things that they nail you for it like health and beauty products you know yeah right yes yes i should i should've um delineated yet your absolutely right it's the food the consumable food parts that you know we don't have to pay tax on yeah yeah yeah and you really have to watch your your um bill sometimes i think um it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries and that's when it really starts to add on and um so um that's that is sort of a help but um i don't know it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of of tax on uh any sale as far as i'm concerned um yeah that would uh it's real interesting this last um tax season i'm a student and the last tax season i had a just a part time job helping out in a tax office and the woman that owned the office was saying she'd had this business for oh probably seventeen or eighteen years and she was saying as the years have gone on there are fewer and fewer things that people can uh take off of their income tax deduct yeah and uh you know if you're not a home owner it's or if you haven't sold property or uh have something major like that it's hardly you know it it's just not much else you can do uh-huh and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her because she used to be real creative about helping them find ways of you know accumulating receipts can't do oh really uh-huh and see i take it she was an accountant yeah can't do it any more so yeah uh-huh i know well i i i also was a student i just graduated in May and um i graduated with a finance degree but that was the big joke the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax uh-huh how interesting that was the big joke oh gosh where did you go to school Clarion University uh-huh uh-huh well you're you're the same age as my daughter because she just graduated from college this year too i'm a graduate student having gone back after many years so um oh nevertheless i am a student and poor yeah uh-huh so it's uh um you know it's been i i guess as far as people like uh our family we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class people with Americans with um college age students you know and um-hum yeah and i there just i don't know i guess as you say you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what you are and uh-huh i think they should go back i i realize you know that we have uh graduated tax brackets but i think they should still go back and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy oh yes absolutely yeah because uh it seems like you they still come out okay um you know uh they yeah yeah you know they always have the argument well you know well who's to say we don't work harder to get that you know well yeah i kind of have my doubts i don't care how much they take off of you you know you're still going to be above on top and i you know like you said i i've worked in different places and the ones that get the most pay do the least work uh-huh that's yes seems that way yeah that the higher they get the you know at least i don't know it seems like um they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience or um or something or just the title sometimes um uh-huh and it it doesn't seem fair and i i know a lot of people do make money um you know in in good investments and things like that but i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling and not a whole not a whole lot of work i agree with you i do think it's a lot of luck and i don't like that part of the finance you know whatsoever yes right i don't know but like what i was saying about the social security that's real you know it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes uh-huh and then the more i think about it the more i think i'm paying in to something that i granted you know i'm paying for my grandparents but i'm never going to see that social security is going to be gone before i ever get any right probably not yeah yes or what's left is not going to be worth anything um you know in terms of how you can actually use it um-hum right they're going to pay me fifty dollars a month well yeah right but that's well and i 'm sorry i put in much more than that you know that's right yeah yeah that's i haven't heard much um in recent years um about social security i mean for a while there not too long ago they were they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt uh-huh you know before very long because so much was going out for programs that were it was that originally it was never intended to be used for or you know programs just weren't in existence and um right uh-huh then i it sort of calmed down i haven't heard much lately but if you have talked about that in your classes you know in the last few years i'm sure that you have heard oh yeah yeah well um i don't know i guess we complain about taxes but i guess you know uh you have to be sort of yeah yeah you you got to look to what they put you know you have decent roads at least yeah you have to appreciate yeah what what you do get for them sometimes and um yeah i guess it's it's worse you know i'd rather see be able see to control my money as much as i do with what's left over taxes than to live in oh England or um some countries where so much of it is socialized that you don't see any of that money at all uh-huh that's true and so you know i guess it's all relative it's how you look at it too yeah that's exactly right i like to instead of thinking how much you know that i'm paying out i like to just look at it and say oh well everyone else is doing it too you know that's right yeah and i  okay well what do you think it um i'm trying to remember exactly how the question was worded what what women's roles and how they've changed change in the last generation or two yeah well one thing and i don't know how how long a span a generation is considered whether we're talking you know twenty years or or or whatever but it seems to me there are more and more women yeah it's obvious there are more and more women working outside the home some of them of course are finally climbing corporate ladders uh whereas when i was growing up it was either secretary or teacher oh yeah uh-huh oh really are you working outside the home yes i work at TI oh okay yeah but i still notice a lot of not necessarily prejudice but i work with a um some men that are very chauvinistic still so do i yeah it is it's it's very hard to deal with because i mean they know that it offends me what the way they act but they do it anyway so i don't know though it's really weird because my i came from a very my family has a lot of strong willed women in it and so i've i've never really you know nobody ever said well you could only be a secretary or a nurse to me i mean you know my my parents were very strong and said you can do whatever you want to do so i got really lucky there but it's real funny i have a niece and a nephew now and my nephew is right seven years old and something was said about my niece being a doctor and he said well she can't be a doctor she can only be a nurse i thought golly you're seven years old and you're already opinionated well and probably probably he hasn't seen any female doctors well yeah that's the only thing i could figure because i'm i'm sure that he didn't get that from my my mother or his mother probably not but but on if he watches television if he gets a coloring book the doctor is is frequently yeah uh she portrayed as a male and the nurse well i'm just i'm just thinking of pictures that i've seen and and you know uh uh i i suspect no no message was ever intended to be while what you have to be this gender oh really yeah to do this job but it does sometimes come through and when i said um that yeah that those were the only two professions folks seemed to do it wasn't necessarily that that was what i was told to do or or whatever it simply that's what i observed growing up was yeah um about the only women you know it a woman at that time could uh clerk in a grocery store or any other kind of store uh-huh be a teacher yeah and i went into teaching that was uh what i had started out doing early on uh-huh and left that when i decided to get married and leave Texas for a while oh really so and i've never gone back to it in the last in the intervening nineteen years it's just uh i i love to teach i don't want to have to deal with the discipline problems and so forth so that's a whole another story right yeah yeah my daddy was a that was his i guess second profession he was a teacher uh okay undying admiration comes from me that's that's for sure huh well that's neat well um it was real funny i went to a seminar that was just it was is a satellite seminar it was really neat and it was just for women uh-huh and they talked about the Cindrella Cinderella syndrome and i had never heard about that had you uh uh not by that term anyway well it's about how women or not necessarily women but little girls are taught that your prince will come and he'll do everything and he'll make everything right oh and um it was really neat because she totally reworked this the story about Cinderella um networked her way to this ball and then it was really neat it was great the way she turned the story around and said you know she left her calling card in the form of a glass slipper and very interesting very creative yeah it was really neat but you know i i hadn't even thought about about fairy tales that they really do leave that impression i'm sure with a lot of little girls well i hadn't thought about it but but very likely i went to a seminar a conference just uh Friday afternoon uh that was put on by by TI but it it dealt with um the minority issues of promotion within the business oh really and they had had invited three speakers from uh one from Xerox and one from Pepsico and and another company out of Denver and the these gentlemen were all uh VP or higher were were from minorities but in addition they were also addressing um women or including women in in the entire focus of right huh the minority issues and so uh it was a very interesting discussion in the afternoon uh the questions and so forth that that their three uh uh speeches engendered uh just talking about well how how does your company deal with this and and and so forth and it was refreshing to hear that uh companies are beginning to address the issue of of uh yeah so few women beyond a certain level so few in the board room and and so forth and so they they shared some of the ideas they their companies were had uh instituted as far as uh uh yeah uh-huh giving a leg up mentoring processes and so forth that they had in place right well that's neat and then one of our VPs shared what what are some of the things that TI is doing to um come up with some similar results yeah huh well that's neat i'm beginning to find more and more female engineers yeah oh really although not um not many of them yet have moved into manager positions that'll part of that's because so many of them are are still real young and they've got to learn the business first and then they can move up uh-huh yeah right well i work in a computer industry also and um i've found very few women that are higher up in the MIS departments um i i can only think of one out of all the people that i've talked to so it's it's amazing that yeah they're out there but they're just slowly moving their way up but hopefully it will all happen and by the time my little niece gets up there she can yeah she can pick whatever she wants to be and if she would like to be the traditional Cinderella and find that prince that's okay too but there right oh yeah yeah i don't want here to be neglected of anything like that but yeah but there are other options that are available oh yeah well um i lost my train of thought no that's okay um well i've lost it i'm sorry hum oh well um yeah it's it's uh i think it's gotten a lot better over the years but like i said i i felt very fortunate that i grew up around strong willed women anyway uh-huh so because i i some of the women that i have worked with are so wimpy that you can understand why men get frustrated with them  okay uh let's see what do you use or how do you control your money well right now we don't have a whole lot of money so there's not much to control um okay basically i'm usually the one that uh handles the money um uh my husband's been unemployed for a little more than a year so we've kind of uh uh-huh it's been extremely tight but we've managed somehow uh-huh um we pay the necessities first and uh then from there if there's anything left yeah try and save some of it right but uh how you want to go ahead and say what you do yeah sure what we uh what we try to do is of course you have to pay your your necessities first right uh-huh and uh you know your rent and whatever else and uh and then after that we always put away some money for savings no matter how much it is uh you know how little or or whatever uh-huh and uh and then after that then we have then our our you know spending money or whatever for miscellaneous things but one thing that we've used and it's it's kind of good because it gives you kind of a savings plan sort of and uh what it is we have a ledger you know just a a book and in it in it we have different accounts uh-huh uh that let's say i would save a hundred dollars a month or something that's what would go into savings for instance uh-huh uh we have it so that in that ledger you know the bank just has it as a hundred dollars going into savings uh-huh well what we do is we take that ledger and we take that hundred dollars and we break it down into different categories so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair maintenance or whatever another uh-huh so you've already got it there when you've got the right and another twenty dollars would go to our clothes another twenty dollars would go to uh you know kids toys or something you know yeah and uh so that then when we want to spend money on clothes or have the car you know serviced or something like that then we just go to that you know that page on the ledger and say okay you know we have whatever saved like a hundred and twenty dollars for clothes so we can go spend you know whatever how you know up to a hundred twenty dollars that's a good idea yeah yeah and that's how we kind of keep track of things so that when the car you know when the car breaks down or something you you have some money at least you know earmarked for that yeah and and it seems to work you don't just go overboard spending too much of the savings on one particular thing right right that's a good idea when we have some money we'll do that and so it you know it seems it it seems to work pretty good you know the only part is you got to keep track of it you know every every month of stuff yeah but that seems to work pretty good and uh the other things we do is just uh just try to uh just try not to spend a whole lot you know with some things of course you have to you know yeah and we try to you know make sure where we go and uh try to catch something on sale or or something like that yeah but how about you guys well some that's there there're several things i do to save money um one is to use garage sales uh-huh uh-huh and we do a lot get a lot of things used and the things that we do have i try and recycle a lot you know before i'll get rid of something i'll look at it and think what else can i do with this and uh how else can i use this right uh-huh to solve some other problem somewhere else you know uh-huh and uh that has helped a lot um and i do shop the sales and buy more than what we need uh-huh so that i've got it ahead of time and i don't have to go out and buy it something not on sale because i've already gotten it on sale uh-huh then when the sale comes around again go ahead and stock up again well that's a good idea yeah um have you gone to any of those places that uh you know like uh uh uh i guess the different names for them are like the Price Club or Sam's or Sam's um we have a Sam's not too far away but i haven't uh used it yet things like that uh-huh uh they're going to they're building a new one that's going to be even closer and i'm i'll probably use it when it's over here even a little closer that's yeah i've been in a couple and it seems like you can get pretty good uh you know stretch your money there because you get the the big things you know yeah you have to buy quantity right right but um that's how you save money you know uh-huh and that's and uh one of my i recently got a master's in computer systems science or computer systems and one of the things i really learned a lot was uh there's a number of programs for the computers if you happen to have a personal computer or whatever that a lot of programs that'll help you budget your money and uh uh-huh and uh it's kind of really neat because it does a lot of things for you as far it gives you all your graphs and your charts and stuff and show you where you're spending money yeah so if you're really honest about inputting everything that you spend your money on you'd be you you're really surprised at like boy you know i spend a whole lot of money on like candy or something you know and yeah yeah well i think there's an awful lot of things that we spend money on that we really don't need yeah and i think since being unemployed we look you look at things more carefully you know do i really need this or is it just something i want uh-huh right right and you have to decide how much you want and and i think uh i've noticed that however much money you have you can spend that much uh-huh or more you know people people will go beyond what they have no matter what they have if they use credit cards that's one thing we're trying right try not to do is to use the credit cards because that just runs right that can get you in trouble pretty quick yeah yeah if you and i really like paying cash instead of checks even um uh-huh we got changed to an economy account at the credit union so it costs less to use less checks right and um those are just little things you can do well that sounds that sounds pretty good well do you have anything else to say or any other plans that you use uh i like what you say about the recycling thing looking at something before you get rid of it that's a good that's a good thing yeah i uh having a garage sale yourself helps uh-huh we just had one this last week end oh did you yeah well we did we did something like that too we recently moved here from California and we had a there was like a bargain fair you know where everybody brings stuff to sell oh yeah and there really we made a lot of money i was surprised a lot of baby clothes we sold and stuff that we don't need any more and stuff but uh yeah yeah but uh i was surprised yeah that's a good way to make some money yeah when you can't use it any more yeah that's right that's uh i think uh learning how to do things yourself a lot helps too like i cut everybody's hair myself uh-huh oh that's good and if you can uh just watch how they do it at the uh shop or  all right do you do exercise i do yes i uh uh i guess it actually changes i do a number of different things simply walking with my wife and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle uh-huh right uh and then moving up i run in the mornings not every morning it probably averages about two days a week uh-huh right and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights which isn't i understand quite exercising but it's along the lines right how about yourself well um that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things but i don't always set out for them to be exercise uh-huh i walk with my parents occasionally nothing's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule and um i play racquetball but i haven't since i've been out of school i don't have anywhere to do that but that's going to start soon again and um i play softball once a week which is kind of more recreation than exercise uh-huh uh-huh because i really don't like to exercise i think that's the basic point of it is i'm not i i don't enjoy it if i know that it's exercise but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity i don't mind right right so i have to disguise it it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it that's kind of the same thing for me i have to not know that it's exercise so i can do it that's right right so you look at it more as a task well yeah if it's exercise it's a task i don't want to do anything i have to do right i see i mean i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom but i won't do it if i have to do it right right so i'm thirty two years old which is probably different than yourself uh-huh right i'm twenty two and so it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise my job at Texas Instruments i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls so right that i don't get any exercise doing that and plus there's a build up of stress so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner and i need to go out in the morning and run or i'll just get nuts right uh-huh right so that's kind of a motivator so even though i can look at it as a task the you know i kind of get the i get some kind of global benefit from the whole thing by saying well i'm lowering my chance of heart attack and thus that type stuff right huh eating right and no cholesterol and all that sure that all i i do all that yeah we i'm sure i will do i'm doing that more and more than i used to i think i'm getting yeah i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it but it's still at the task stage right is it a pleasure for you or are you well it's a something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable i do that at the end of the day and it takes you know that that during that time the stress from the day goes away i get to share whatever i did with my wife and and vice versa hum right right going to the gym is is actually something different than than like oh and the running and i enjoy that too year i've been running since high school on track teams and the like so uh-huh oh so running i i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated running where you don't feel your muscles any more uh-huh right and you don't think about the pain of it you you you take the time to relax some how and you think about other things during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and why you can't breathe and this and that and that's no fun and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people uh-huh right that's i never got past that stage yeah the exercise the uh weight lifting on the other hand is actually you know i think i look better right i have just a i don't i'm not a huge person i'm just a regular looking guy but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself that get that little bit of definition in your muscles is is attractive uh-huh right so that pays also that's good yeah so so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work the with my wife which is nice i love her you know i enjoy being with her i guess that's one thing but also uh that that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles yeah uh-huh right that's it i do the occasional push up and sit up i haven't really brought myself to go to the the gym because that's very stressful to me because i feel yeah i felt real competitive there and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are but oh yeah i don't i don't let that bother me but yeah that's something that comes with time too you know i'll tell you the sit ups and push ups are excellent yeah right uh-huh you know it's your own you you're you're struggling against your own body weight right you can do have variety by putting your feet higher or lower by putting your arms further apart or closer together by doing them real quick or real slow and you can actually get a good work you can right i know in the push up at least you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up just doing push ups uh-huh that's a good idea but i do have my ride we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house oh is that right i'll do those once in a while just you know like at eleven thirty when Love Connection is on and i can't sleep i'll get up and stair step for half an hour so right yeah right that's funny yeah it's i guess pretty pretty healthy but i don't have an a regular plan that's yeah i need to get started on that well maybe you know maybe not i'd say i'd say at twenty two you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting getting the exercise otherwise right when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a plan and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between uh-huh uh when you when you add something to your life when you add a plan to your life something else has to go away uh-huh and that's the hard decision is okay if i'm going to run in the mornings what am i what do i trade it off for well the answer's sleep right if i'm going to walk at night what do i trade it off for well Star Trek sleep uh-huh or you know it it it's always trade-offs and you actually have to as you get older you have to re ally think what can go and what to to to replace this thing it's i mean not just exercise but anything it's yeah right very hard and uh i don't i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet that'll come some day when i yep yeah i guess if you care or if your wife your future wife uh gives you a reason to care which helps right well i think we covered it well i hope so yeah sounds good nice talking with you Craig yeah you too have a nice day bye you too good day bye  okay well i i i guess if i was having a dinner party i depending on the number of people i might cook a like a brisket or a roast or a maybe a chicken dish um-hum and um i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a a potato dish and we usually serve fresh fruit and uh then make a dessert oh that sounds good so that makes um we're not uh real wealthy at the moment last time i had people over for dinner we had lasagna and i used my mother's recipe i really like it it's got um you cook the noodles and make and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it and i'm not sure she even puts must be some Italian spices in there i can't remember but um for the cheese part you mix uh sour cream and cream cheese and cottage cheese well that sounds good and uh layer all that and it's good and then then uh uh tossed salad and that sounds good and um oh my goodness Diane get down from there and uh let's see what else did i serve with that corn yeah i made French bread with that one too i have a recipe that's pretty good for that bread do you have bread to go with it gosh so oh well lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds yeah i've heard you know i've heard a lot of people say uh it short cut on the cooking for lasagna they they've told me that they go to Sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna i've heard that Sam's has a really good lasagna so in in fact i think i had it at a at a party once it was good yeah did you well i i know people that have have served it and they say gosh if you have company coming easy where you don't want to be always in the kitchen it's easy and she said it's they said it's good so that that's always sounds good to me um i feel like i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot yeah yeah i cook guess i cook a seems seems like i cook a lot of dinners so uh not always for company just for just for family oh i know oh yeah so feels like i'm often in the kitchen not my favorite place but but a time consuming place to be a necessity yeah right right so what let's see what else do we like to have for trying to think what else i like to serve my mother likes to serve taco grandes no i don't know what that is no i don't know what that is have you ever had that you take a flour tortilla and you fry it like a taco shell and you uh for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some um okay right tomato sauce in it and and i like to just add Picante sauce to get the Mexican flavor so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff and then um right let's see and then and you heat up refried beans and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese and what you do to make it you take the shell and you spread the beans on first then you put the meat then you put the grated cheese and then you put um see what's next then and i i usually put the cut up tomatoes next and then the um right lettuce and you can put uh like guacamole and Katy i'm on the phone well get a towel or go change i'm on the phone um oh a little sour cream is good and and chopped olives right right do you like to make your own guacamole uh yeah yeah we've we don't make it very often i guess but uh no no i don't very often usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain so it yeah i just cut slices off and i like an avocado sandwich too oh do they gosh oh gosh oh that's good that's good or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich yeah yeah oh well we made i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day and and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad what you want uh where do they get it so well i don't know i guess they don't have it at home i can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe they must they just said they never had it at home so i i was concerned that i oh taking this you know taking this as a dip i thought gosh you know sometimes when we have it at home it it turns dark on the top so quickly so i just yeah it helps if you it helps if you leave the pit in it oh does that help yeah if you leave the pit in the bowl with the thing especially while you're waiting before you serve it okay well that's supposed to help keep the um keep it from turning brown so quick well i'll have to remember that well i just i that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top and it really stayed longer than i ever thought it would so i thought maybe that was the trick oh oh that's good that probably helps too yeah yeah so oh well i guess we bought a lot of we've been buying turkey lately instead of beef so even though you know the ground turkey it's do you want it oh yeah we have too the meat is softer and i everybody seems to like it so do you want scrambled we've most sometimes it seems to be cheaper too so we often buy the we buy the yeah yeah if you get it on sale yeah yeah so we bought that or we bought the the fillets and then the chicken or turkey nuggets and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference unless you tell them so or in yeah yeah i don't think mine know either in fact we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey too it costs less than the other and i don't know there's supposed to be something more healthy about it poultry instead of the beef and yeah yeah less cholesterol less cholesterol yeah right right well i guess that's probably all we need to do for today pork yeah yeah i i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve um i always like dessert one sa lad that we always like my sister-in-law always brings to family dinners is a i don't know what you call it uh you mix um cottage cheese and a package of JELL-O and a thing of uh like CoolWhip right right that's always good probably probably the only family recipe that we that's good and quick and easy we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake and we take a recipe from my grandmother and um uh-huh it's probably fairly typical cream cheese and egg and sugar in the insides but the  okay yes well this is a very timely topic in as much as we're going to a family reunion this weekend yes oh are you really where is it going to be down at Lake Texoma lodge yes this is one that's uh the Baker family reunion oh uh-huh and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty five years or thirty something like that maybe longer than that i'm going to get back into the fifties sometime oh that's marvelous um-hum first time i got i married into the family and the first time i went was about fifty seven i think uh-huh but uh this one has been uh been well organized and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now it's Lake Texoma because that's more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to um-hum i'm sure location is really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be very important because uh you'll start losing people if it's too far to go um-hum we have factions when it's one part we i have one reunion on my mother's side and we found that if it's in a certain part of Texas some people come and if it's elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like so i think we need to find a new place yeah yeah never get them at both places right listen they've uh they've had this one well it just of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they uh have a golf tournament on the Saturday um-hum um and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such oh that's a neat idea yeah and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge and everyone brings in food um-hum and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant and uh it really uh has worked out um-hum how many people Jim are involved uh generally uh i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people i think normal is about sixty or seventy wow yeah well i guess um ours probably isn't that big our family is dwindling for one thing oh and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died i just have one aunt and my family oh so sometimes when these other families get together they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids and we're kind of off on the sidelines yeah but it does remind us that we have family and roots so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it right yeah well our family started reunion started out my wife and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak um-hum and now we go our children go and our grandchildren are going now so it's uh wound up that uh we're the old folks now oh that's great um-hum um-hum but um they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids um-hum and several people bring boats and there's a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it it's a full day some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend and some just come in for Saturday so there's lots to do um-hum uh-huh so it uh has worked out quite well and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long except that once a year um-hum that's true well that's neat i i think they're really fun we go to mine regularly and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple and he has a large family so it's it's fun when we go to that one yeah my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia and i think we've been to one in thirty five years or something like that so oh that's just too far away oh it would be more yeah yeah that that is a problem with the distance the people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way and it's just too much for all of them yeah it's an all day drive just to get to this area all of that group to travel right but then we have the same attitude when it's out there although this year we're going out they're going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be yeah fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion yeah yeah we have uh each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and um-hum um-hum and choose some place that everybody's going to like assembling of stuff right as far as food and all that that's correct so that's a heavy burden yes it is i i i don't really care for her to be president again no but that is uh it's it's a lot of work but it's a lot of fun um-hum we've enjoyed it and well i think the grandkids really enjoy it because it's the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma yeah and it's it's good for kids to know that they have other family yeah and this year they're all excited The show this weekend this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and T-shirts and such oh boy oh what fun uh-huh so it's uh it's going to be exciting for them and for us too um-hum probably lots of laughs oh yes there have been some really wild shows put on there they uh really get uh into it um-hum well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along ours ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it and yeah well oh that generally happens they do it as a labor of love so the officer idea is a good idea yes yeah well we've uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it um-hum and again it's not it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting meeting room down in the cabins and such but uh they've come up with they've tried passing the hat and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds and uh yeah um-hum um-hum some people do and some people don't yeah and it's not fair that everybody not contribute excuse me but um anyway that's the family reunion story um-hum okay well thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you been nice talking to you bye bye  okay what do you think is the biggest problem the biggest problem well like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools uh-huh that uh you know you can throw money at it but it's i don't know to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way you know because i mean the general values that we're teaching uh-huh kind of conflict with what we expect out of people in school i mean yeah is it the do you think it's the values that they're teaching in school or the the values they get from home uh well the values more or less at home and the TV just a general i mean learning is not a a revered endeavor really i mean it's a lot more it's socially well i won't say socially unacceptable but whereas like in uh a person that uh study they put a lot more emphasis on athletics and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society and i think that carries over to school a lot so right yeah i i i i think that the biggest problem is uh with the uh with the the home environment being part of it you know if i think too many parents expect uh the the school to teach uh the moral aspects of of things to the students to the kids and you know while we're not going to worry about uh teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that you know and then uh expect them to to pick it up at school and you're not going to do that you know you're going to carry carry with carry to school uh out into the world you know what you learned at home and uh yeah uh i think that that part of that's showing up now you know with with things because kids i think have probably less respect than for for people than in in other things than than uh we may have seen in the past uh and uh part of it's the the family i think and part of it's uh the living conditions of certain people are are subjected too uh drugs is a big problem now and i think that's that's that's another root problem yeah yeah you know i wonder if that's a a root problem or not because i think about that a lot and it's just like everybody likes to blame uh everything on drugs now but i wonder you know do you get the oh that's kind of side tracked but uh i just remember seeing on the news the other night they had the thing about how Catholic schools are doing so much better uh-huh i thought well you know of course they're doing better and not so much when i was growing up uh Catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools but uh they still had a a better success rate simply because they started with a lot better raw material i mean everybody that went to a Catholic school had uh at least the parents did at least had education as a priority like you said and kind of had a whole conducive atmosphere to it and i wonder if not so much that uh right right well i think it's like you say it's it's the socioeconomic mix there you know the they're uh the you you look at the if the if the the uh schools like that that where you got a lot of kids who are basically uh that might be more well to well off you know going to a private Catholic school or whatever uh and and they're not all that way but you know some that are um yeah that they're they're they're not quite the same as as the kids that are going to the inner city uh you know public schools yeah this is interesting because i in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a Catholic school being a suburban kind of environment but uh this this was actually inner city yeah people were sending i mean just because their kids had the ability and the and the drive to do try and get an education they didn't send him to a public school you know you have like you said you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance well you know in a lot of cases uh like that where you know if kids are going to a public parochial school like that it's it's because the parents are more interested in them receiving them uh uh an education it shows i think it shows that the parents have some uh desire for for the kid to do do well you know and that may be now passed on down to to the kid as well and uh maybe they pick up on that yeah then and then from the other aspect um maybe the uh the school itself is is has more emphasis on uh trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller uh they may be able to to give the resources that's needed to uh to do a good job yeah i wondering what do you what would you do to fix the school systems uh uh that's a tough question how to fix the school system uh with uh i would try to yeah i guess uh to see about getting parents more involved try to to come up with more ways to do that uh uh uh stress the importance of education to both both the parents and the students and uh more more classes that i think that are and i think this is is happening some around the country in terms of um morals trying to teach the kinds of things that that aren't getting taught at home and uh and and respect for other people uh i think that's a big part of it you know people you know if you don't care about property and people you know you're not going to care about uh about learning i think yeah you know you're not going to really care about yourself yeah that's what i was going to say it's the chicken and the egg thing i wonder a lot of times you know people i mean a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools you know vandalism wise and you go to right uh-huh i mean it's been a while since i been in high school they're even in grade school when they do that but i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that but you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything and take it out on the school well you know and i that's not an easy but that's not an easy task you know that's why i say it's it's a tough question what would you do because you know even trying to instill those values is kind of hard when uh when when you're growing up in you know in a home which may be uh just the pits and uh you know you don't have any any kind of a environment good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other people's stuff as well when you're when you you barely have anything yourself so i could see where that would be a problem and i think that's i think it's there are others yeah  okay okay i my children as a matter of fact are all grown now so i am assisting assisting uh them with their children in their selections so uh-huh oh great great well my children are grown but they're teenagers so i have three children um fifteen ages fifteen seventeen and twenty um-hum um-hum and um about i guess about when the first when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working working at a preschool and uh you know doing some work and then i i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool so uh-huh um-hum so i am around not a day care situation but in the you know in the child care environment um-hum so um well i myself really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment uh-huh than the one on one care is uh when my children were growing up i actually had them up and until they were in the preschool situation i had them in a in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids and i felt like that home environment was very important to them yes it was important to me and uh yes uh-huh i feel like that they they had that one on one that's so necessary at that age however in today's environment oh it is uh yeah um-hum it may be more critical to have the ability to interact in large groups simply because that's the way our young people are are dealt with they're dealt with in packages yeah in other words there're more people yes yes that's that's an interesting point of view i uh you know seeing the children in the school the way i do i i mean i see the ones that we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all when they come in as three year olds as as opposed to the ones that have been in the program that started at twelve months maybe and were were even in there one day a week um-hum um-hum sure um-hum which is all our school provides for the you know for the under three year old but still they have an opportunity an opportunity to be with other children um-hum um-hum absolutely and it is true and uh i but i think that would but as far as looking for a place you know i i the criteria i mean i think it's very important to have very caring people you know to take care of the the in a school if you're going to have the structure and you're going to have the large numbers you're going to need really oh absolutely without a doubt um-hum i recently stopped by McDonald's and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center and of course she was she had just gotten her degree and she was so enthusiastic and she was excited about it and she was going to accomplish all of these things yes yes however uh when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time the pay is minimal yes it is and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves yes that's right that maybe in order to be in that environment yeah that maybe have another salary in their family that where they can do that and that's what i had the opportunity of you know doing and and i could concentrate on the creativity and and absolutely um-hum you know really having a lot of fun with the children and and providing them with a great atmosphere um-hum well they ask so much of those caretakers for the amount that that they they pay they are to be there ahead of time you know they're there early to receive the kids yes and they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning that's right and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six P M and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those which is yeah yes yes that's true that's true and uh she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary uh and she yeah yeah because people can't pay to provide and well ours is not you know ours is just is a church and so we um-hum um-hum we don't have the the expenses of a building you know we share the expense with the church but we don't have enough you know taking care of a whole building and that responsibility so uh it is it is a lot different um-hum sure um-hum well i know that when my youngsters were small now my older son was adopted so he went into child care at two weeks and uh my younger son went into child care at six weeks oh my goodness yeah yeah so they were in that environment actually up until they became uh seven and nine uh-huh and at that point i said look they have been given the custodial care that they need and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them however they're going out into the school environment now they're under a lot of other influences i need to be here for them i need to be involved in their school because i want to be the one yes who influences the way they develop so i quit working after my kids started to school and got involved in volunteer work in their private school so that i could help direct their their learning experiences and their development oh you did um yeah yeah i i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them um-hum and hold them but when time came to direct their ability to make choices yes yes um-hum um-hum to develop the kinds of things that that they're going to need to interact with other people i felt like i needed some strong influence there yeah well that's different than most people do it i mean a lot of people do it really the reverse and go to work after the children are in school you know so i did i know that's right once they get up in school um-hum um-hum um-hum but uh well i just felt very strongly about that and i i did not work as a matter of fact my son was in the second grade and when he started uh at Skyline High School i asked him son when uh you know where do i go to sign up for the PTA and he said mom don't do that to me please don't do that to me so i knew it was time to go back to work but i feel very good about spending those years with my boys i know yeah yes that's true uh and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience it was in a home uh the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it she was from um uh uh Argentina and she was going back home and i couldn't just you know wait for eight three or four months and then bring them back to her so i had to find a new place um-hum yes yes and i put them in this home the kids cried when i took them the kids cried when i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick the m up they were always cranky and irritable oh dear oh dear so i just took off and went there one day and uh the children were left unattended in a room you know they they were not well cared for oh how awful and uh so it didn't take me long to take t hem out of that place but that's the only bad experience i had the rest of the time they stayed in La Petite Academy and i was very pleased with their development and their progress yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn but they're going to learn it sometime so but for the most part they did have good care yeah yeah and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the Y and taught to swim um-hum which just pleased me to death because i've always been have you know been afraid of the water however my uh older son came home and he said mom i don't like that man oh yes oh said he took me by the head and dunked my head under the water and told me i had to get my face wet or i'd never swim oh gosh oh dear boy it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school yes and relay that to them and she said well she said you know kids do exaggerate but she said let's go ahead and send him another day or two days and i promise you faithfully i will watch the instructor every minute oh good yes and see exactly what's happening  so do you have PC i have a personal computer at home it's an AT compatible huh-uh i don't use it very much any more i used to use it quite a bit uh-huh i also have a PC at work that i use as a terminal i do some PC stand alone work on it and i can transfer data back and forth between the PC and the main frame uh-huh what about you do you own a computer um well i sort of own a computer we have two PCs at home but neither one do we really own um both are no both of them are sort of work related and are you leasing them loners loaners from work yeah that's the nicer way right of do you work for TI no no um i actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby and my husband's working at Bell Labs but he's really from France and these computers actually are from France what brand are they one of them's a Compaq um-hum it's a three eighty six i'm jealous and the other is actually a IBM PC compatible it's a three eighty six guess it's twenty five yeah three eight six twenty five C maybe i don't know no we don't have the cash that's right we decided not to get the cash which is actually another loaner one too that we've picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing and what kind of consulting do you do um well i actually do some work working at MIT and at NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology uh-huh in Washington and then i worked for Dragon Systems for a while what kind of work do you do when you're consulting um well it depends it's very different in the different places but is it programming related yeah yeah program related research related i've i work in speech the speech field and i i do a lot about acoustics phonetics and uh-huh looking at the uh acoustic characteristics of speech and so i do that type of stuff typically for other people and we use uh here we use the PCs to do that and mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that word processing well more uh do you know Latek no i'm not familiar with it word text word text processing so i don't i don't use i mean you can call it word processing but i don't usually use a word processor to do it um-hum and we don't have too much standard software like i haven't bought we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or um doing research looking at the speech signal and then doing writing and also as a just as a terminal and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that so you've got you've got a modem in it then uh neither one has a modem but we have a modem at home you have a modem that you can connect to each of them neither one right uh and so it's an external modem i got when i got mine i had an internal modem in it i used it uh quite a bit when i was um yeah we have uh-huh uh looking at uh information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in a in Fort Worth but uh went out of town for a while and and sort of got off the uh uh bulletin board and of my micro completely um-hum uh-huh and after a while the modem started making noises on its own without uh even without using it on the computer i could turn a computer on it'd start squawking so i finally opened up the box and took it out so that was it i think that's the thirty second warning oh i didn't hear it do you hear the the beep in the background yes oh that's a an ambulance or something going on here i think okay where i haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually where are you and uh in Manhattan are you at home now so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close yeah i'm at home uh-huh so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean because there's a lot of background noise that you know people can hear so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up um yeah and often times that i can't talk on the can't do this much later than now between sort of like six five thirty and six thirty or something like that because the traffic outside they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone conversation what time is it now where you are uh about twenty after four so you're an hour ahead of where i am i'm in Central Central time zone okay yeah we're Eastern and um what did did you ever try using like Prodigy or any of those systems no i haven't done that uh i know someone who has and and she's uh very uh pleased with it she told me some of the things you can do and it's just a a very uh handy tool to have uh-huh yeah and and you can do a lot it it makes things very convenient you can save a lot of money too certainly cut down on long distance charges if you if that's what you have in mind uh-huh yeah i've never tried using that i don't know too much about it what about have you did you use commercially available software or i have uh i have used Lotus i have used uh Word Perfect uh i not heavy use i've used uh D Base and uh i've used a substantial amount of shareware uh-huh um i haven't done much Lotus work connected with my job i've been through three classes and i have a great deal of respect for it uh-huh uh-huh um i haven't done much word processing work with my job i do some and i and the D Base work i've done was strictly class related um-hum i've never used D Base um but i've heard both good things and bad things about it well it's probably the granddaddy of most uh data base management systems there it's got some pretty uh strong competitors some of them have reviews that are better than D Base so i uh i uh i think uh by now it's a matter of uh personal taste uh-huh yeah people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use i can understand that very easily i've used uh i've had a class on um R Base and also in Paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base uh-huh uh-huh do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days um i wouldn't say compatible but there certainly comparable well i don't i yeah i didn't mean compatible i meant comparable my brain is going to mush um and what do you work on at TI i'm a computer programmer on the IBM main frames i do uh main mainly business data processing um-hum uh-huh uh-huh i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility uh-huh okay um sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem and that gives me the opportunity to come in to work and fix it if i can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone right um fun i also uh handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something were connected  okay okay now now we're supposed to talk about music why why did you check music right why did i pick music uh-huh oh because i know a little bit about music you know so i thought that i would put that plus i i like uh to listen to music uh-huh what kind of music do you enjoy um i really enjoy the oldies is what i really listen to most of the time like what what kind of oldies uh like the fifties oldies or older oldies usually in the fifties uh-huh i'm not really sure i think it's it's a fifties sixties and seventies station that i listen to uh-huh uh-huh they have the same kind of station down here and when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to uh-huh oh really i don't know a lot of the um uh musicians' names or the singers' names but i know a lot of the old songs uh-huh uh-huh we just got a disk the other day that was a um disk of Nat Nat King Cole's greatest hits and it is excellent it it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it it's really an excellent oh yeah excellent CD we are we were really quite pleased with it uh-huh have you um do you listen have you heard of Nat heard of Nat King Cole yes i have okay well um um do you play any musical instruments or anything um i played the accordion for seven years and i played the clarinet for seven years also really at at the same time or no i played the accordion until i got into about sixth or seventh grade and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet and i played that all through high school uh-huh Like so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school yeah i i played the baritone horn in high school band and in college so and my wife played flute in high school i was yes oh okay so uh-huh and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet really really actually that's exactly the same thing my ex-wife did she played the clarinet and then she played bass clarinet during concert band yeah uh-huh oh really yes yeah so i like the low notes better than the high notes so we didn't have any bass clarinet players so i asked him if i could play it because i was first clarinet and they end up playing a lot of the high notes and i don't i don't care for the sound of the high notes so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet and he said sure you know he didn't have anyone to play it so i played it and i really enjoyed it um well i like it i i like the low instruments better too uh-huh um do you go to do you go to listen to much live music pardon me do you listen to much live music like concerts or things there no i really don't go to very many concerts uh-huh we're we're going to one here in a couple of weeks the um um i don't know if you follow Broadway much but uh Michael Crawford was in Phantom of the Opera on Broadway you know you know whom i'm talking about uh-huh yes and he's coming to Dallas on the twenty ninth and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of uh Andrew Lloyd Webber's music so that'll be good oh wow my sons are kind of into Broadway they they my my older son is at Columbia in New York City and he's been to see Phantom and Les Miserables and bunch of other things up there so i would love to be able to go see Les Miserables and he does it he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets to that thing yeah yeah and one of the uh the last time they went up a friend of his wanted to go and Chris didn't want to go so the friend David went and oh my gosh he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets and they they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bell John it's his house seat that's under his control and he said it was a great seat holy smoke so he he's been to they've been to see it several times oh i would love to go see that and Cats yeah Chorus Line yeah i would love to be able to go see those would they do don't any of those ever come to Pittsburgh they do but i work and i went to i go to college i had just gotten i just graduated from college in May and so i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them sure well we're kind of you know they well i saw two two road shows of Les Miserables and they were both excellent uh-huh so if it comes to Pittsburgh in the road shows and i think they have three different companies that tour the US um you should go see it because it's really it's really outstanding yeah my brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff and he went to New York a bunch of there was like twenty students from high school that went and he went to New York with them and he saw it and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen right and he doesn't even like that type of stuff well i think it's just incredible i and then you know those um two guys who wrote Les Miserables wrote a new show call Miss Saigon oh really yeah it just opened in New York this spring and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it and they got tickets for the opening night oh and they went to it and they said it was it was great it was great oh see now i like that type of stuff but my fiancee doesn't really like it he's more into the New Wave music yeah like depressed mode and yeah i guess i don't know either you know yeah i don't too much but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff oh i don't know uh really weird names like The Dead Milkman or sure i don't know oh it's you know really weird stuff he likes and i thought oh my gosh so he listens to New Wave and you listen to the oldies that's kind yeah that's kind of different well that's good though you know it's good to cover all the bases there well i pretty i'll listen to anything basically except i don't like the real hard metal rock uh-huh i just refuse to listen to that at all i'll even listen to country i don't i like some country well we don't now we don't listen to much country but we just at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album we bought Garth Brooks' album No Fences uh-huh that is excellent do you like Randy Travis we well we i've never never listened i mean i've i've probably heard him but i've never bought any of his music uh-huh Garth Brooks is probably the only country album we have or no wait my wife bought an album of Hank Williams' greatest hits oh Hank Williams Junior nope this is Hank Williams senior so these are a bunch of old recordings oh uh-huh she bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks oh yeah well those should be good albums it is pretty good she likes it it's a little it's a little too country for me it's a if you have the chance little too uh honky-tonk or something yeah uh-huh i like i like the Garth Brooks album a lot uh-huh it's pretty good it's pretty good um i don't know maybe you wouldn't like Randy Travis he's really country himself but uh uh-huh i you know i i really enjoy listening to his music which album which of his albums do you think is the best oh i don't know If i were you i would get the Greatest Hits album okay if he had one because you know that would have a mixture of all his you know top songs on it but um we have i think four records of his i can't you know name the names of them off hand but we have i think all his records so far and all my brothers and sisters listen to them even the ones that like the heavy metal uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh they really enjoy listening to him so uh-huh you know maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth you know maybe you would enjoy Travis uh Randy Travis well i i think we'll probably get one one of his albums because we do kind of like it but you know it's kind of different uh-huh yeah so so it's good um do you know any oh i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would you know i mean the women do you like the Judds yeah we do like the Juds in fact we have a Juds album  what do you think about it well i i feel in light of some of the accidents and so forth that have happened lately that i think there are some occupations that they should such as the health field the transportation field uh they're already doing it in the armed forces where they handle weapons and so forth uh they do it to prisoners so i i uh yeah i i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions and i think if if uh an employer feels that he wants to to drug test employees and they don't like it then they should not be employed there that was you know i would not mind it yeah i i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else you know harm or injury absolutely right and i don't have a problem at all with employers uh testing in the hiring process but i i i don't i don't have a problem with them too much testing even after the fact but i do a little bit where it where it wouldn't hurt anybody i don't know sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far uh-huh but well unless an employer has a reason to believe that his uh the work competency of yeah um of the employee employee is is hurting the business i mean maybe it's uh number one because generally if if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft right and then it's not a problem yeah and as an employer i would think that would be and the first it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost there's no way but but my concern is uh school bus drivers oh absolutely oh yeah um i'm not even i'm in education i'm not even opposed to it for that train the train drivers uh i'm concerned in the medical field yeah i i i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas too because i consider that a drug i wish they would i i wish they would and that i think is even probably more widely abused by you know the masses than than drugs so to speak right right right but when you consider they could be driving an airplane or driving a bus or so oh i know it a train um and it doesn't take that long uh they they don't have be totally roaring drunk just a little off on their timing could could mean life and no just uh yeah and now TI has the random testing policy and and you know our names or our employee numbers or whatever are in a in a pool oh okay uh-huh you know so i've already been tested once when i was hired and and once since they initiated this random testing program uh-huh uh-huh but i work with one girl who was tested her name got got randomly selected three times in six months oh my word and i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it when there's no you know there's no reason to suspect someone you know that that's getting a little bit that's enough to make anybody paranoid control right well as long as you accept that it is a random a random testing uh yeah you know to to alleviate that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me if it's almost like being selected for jury duty right yeah you know so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel that's that's just the way it is you were just the lucky or the unlucky one depending on how you look at it i would i would rather have it that way to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in oh absolutely because i i think there's when you let other employees turn in people there are so many people with with their petty axes to grind it could really get out of hand and right right so i i i would really rather know however there's got to be some backup to say that if if somebody does observe you at say at a party uh using drugs i would think that it would be their obligation to report that yeah to report it and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor maybe anonymously or something personnel or something right because i i would feel very uncomfortable working with someone i knew was using either illegal drugs or abusing alcohol i'd just i'd feel really uncomfortable right well i don't know what kind of work you do but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way and yeah we have we have a lot of people who work on the line i'm in accounting so it wouldn't you know they they couldn't hurt me with their ten key or something but out on the line they've got people working some serious equipment right right right it's it's so i i just think employers have to have especially given today the drug abuse that goes on i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at risk because they're the ones who are going to have the lawsuits the insurance claims et cetera and and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to put at risk i agree totally uh illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse and in the long run we're all paying for that so it's i mean it it protects us in the long run hopefully when they do that right right i i was trying to remember there was a court case uh here here where i live just a few months ago the city workers they wanted to um the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing uh and the city workers uh took them to court to protest saying that it invaded their i guess first amendment the the search and seizure amendment uh-huh uh-huh and it's still tied up in the legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not huh so i'm curious especially since TI a local you know employer is also already doing it seeing what what they'll say about it especially since to see how that's is it is it uh just a small group of the employees that are concerned well it's the whole it's the whole city seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it they they just don't want to be drug tested yeah so you know we've never my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested y eah uh my husband's retired from i R S agents uh-huh however this isn't a problem that we have and either alcohol or drug and so we we in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal right yeah that's the way i looked at it if i had something to hide it's one thing but i'm you know you know you don't so it's not as big a deal and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned about their rights or whether they're really concerned about something else right and and then they say well if you give them the right to do this then they're going to take some other right away from you but i i a firm i don't believe that i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything and of course the big deal one of the big deals now too is to that when you come into a company as you sign a paper saying that i will go take a  okay um Sunday i went to see Robin Hood along with fifty million other people hi bet you stood in a long line didn't you no we got really lucky the first theater that we went to was sold out so we ran down the road to another one and it wasn't too bad it was pretty crowded once we got in there well you've seen the more recent one than i have then i have we don't usually go out to movies we usually wait until we can watch them at home yeah that's really a lot of fun too right uh we have been trying to get out to go but it just seems like with working and well and it's so expensive unless you go yeah i mean and it is getting that way isn't it well did you like Robin Hood yeah i did um i hadn't seen any of the earlier ones so i really didn't know what to expect but they had injected a lot of humor into it which i really liked yes the previews look like that that's the way it was yeah and so and there was a lot of action lot of swashbuckling type of things but um i really liked the humor of course i love Kevin Costner so that helped oh yeah well that's needless to say really did you see Dances With Wolves Dancing it doesn't hurt to sit and watch him for two hours no i never went to see that one i haven't either we want too uh because everyone tells us that we'd better go see it on a wide screen so yeah that's definitely what i want to do but i think by then that might even be at the dollar movies so well uh maybe so i'll have to check that out but uh i think that some of the most recent ones we've gotten and rented have been Ghost and yeah oh really did you like that yes did you yes very much uh-huh in fact uh you know it's one of those things that i want to see more than once yeah yeah definitely yes and uh oh we got Memphis Belle and all the things that are out at the current time now is that the one is that the one with uh who's in Memphis Belle that's about the airplane the old airplane the airplane yeah was that good yes it's good huh i didn't realize that was already on video it is it's been out about the same time Ghost came out oh yeah so we we uh we'll i watch and grab the first one that comes out and of course we have some grandchildren so we're taping or or watching as many of the cartoon types as we can get and get them and uh oh yeah well my cable had a Disney preview on this weekend and so i taped a bunch of shows off of that yeah right yes well we've gotten our children are still small so uh we just they like the little Peter Pans and all that sort of thing uh-huh oh yeah i have a niece that is just in love with The Littlest Mermaid she just thinks that's the best show in the world yes well they have a a movie out now and i saw it at Blockbuster's and it's called Baby Talk Baby Songs huh and our little two year old granddaughter just loves it and it's real down to her level it's songs about getting up and getting dressed and getting dressed on your own by yourself and oh really that'd be neat it tells you that you're a miracle and there's nobody like you and it's very uh huh i'll have to go get that my little two year old niece is coming to see me for her vacation so i guess i'll go see if i can get that you would she would really love it and we're even thinking about uh buying a copy of it of the tape to put in our church library because i think it's a it's a real excellent movie to sort of build kids' little kids' egos up and tell them that they can oh yeah yeah they're individuals and they can do what they want to on their own and and it's it's a real real nice little movie huh well that would be neat yeah i was a when i was growing up i was the victim of that of the Cinderella movie because they say that now girls my age have the Cinderella syndrome where they think that their prince is going to come and solve all their problems oh that doesn't happen doesn't not in real life yeah so no well i think that uh i think that it sounds like that our lives run along the same path as far as movies go we kind of like the same thing yeah yeah i really enjoy comedies and then i do too and and love stories i'm not for much into Silence of the Lamb or anything like that yeah no i wouldn't go see that if i had to i don't think i'd i'd have nightmares i would too i just i'm not interested at all no there're have been a few they're not really spy movies i guess they're suspenseful movies that yeah that don't have a lot of the blood and gore because i just can't deal with that but i do kind of like the suspense well now that's that's not bad no who wants to yes exactly i mean you know i i love old old Hitchclock Hitchcock classics things like that but some of the rest yeah i wouldn't go see Silence of The Lambs if i had to uh-huh yeah i like those too yeah right no no that'd be the last one on our list yeah oh shoot but um Backdraft is supposed to be really good yes oh i want to see that one too yeah my sister-in-law said she just really enjoyed that that had been one of the better ones she had seen all summer well good so i guess i'll have to eventually get to that one yeah exactly huh well do you tape movies off the TV well yes yes in fact a lot of times i'll scan through the program to see if i can find something that we'd like to tape to watch during our during the week yeah yeah well especially right now because there're all reruns just on regular TV but i don't find many yeah exactly and i don't find too many yeah it's kind of difficult well like i said this weekend Disney had Singing in the Rain on and so i taped it yes yeah we've we've got that on tape too from once before channel thirteen uh put that on because oh somehow or other they had interrupted it oh really so they put it on straight through without any commercials in it and so we got it that night and i've got all the old musicals like Oklahoma and um Hello Dolly oh wow yeah oh yeah that's like watching that Disney preview they're going to have South Pacific on and i mean just all these great old classic musicals and i thought boy i think i'm going to have to trade in my HBO and get Disney oh my gosh oh that's wonderful yeah you know well i was just thinking about maybe we ought to have Disney well oh i would love to have it but you know it's kind of hard to justify when you don't have children yeah well that's true but you know looking through the program as i do i see a lot of things on there that are not just for children yeah so oh yeah well especially with all those old musicals because i just love them i do too i love all the old musicals and all the like you said the old Alfred Hitchcock and uh just old movies yeah yeah i taped uh Funny Girl was on a couple of weeks ago so i taped that one oh really yeah um i guess i missed that yeah there's a lot of fun ones that was like on channel twenty one so it it had the commercials in between it but you can fast forward through those oh uh-huh well that's okay yes exactly oh well uh you sound like that you like are like us you don't go out too much to the movies but no we really don't i mean we we both work and so we're exhausted when we get home and then the weekends there's always so much to do to catch up from what you didn't do all week we do too isn't that the truth that's exactly the truth so really i think Sunday going to see Robin Hood was the first time i had gone with my husband to the show in a year probably well i have uh one son still at home and they went to see that the other day too liked it real well yeah yeah and uh he goes to movies but and he'll come home and he'll say well you'll like this and you'll like that so or he he and i pretty well like the same thing so um-hum well it really has gotten outrageous though with the prices because i mean if you are a young kid trying to go on a date it'd cost you a fortune yeah well they pretty well have to go Dutch they really do yeah or go to the Saturday afternoon cheap show yeah exactly oh shoot well i say it was nice talking to you about it well you too and maybe i'll get you  okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some no i don't use a family budget my father who's very old has kept one his entire life and i probably rebelled rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out uh-huh oh interesting on a very strict percentage yes well um we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know and never have gotten out of it i can't really say that it's a formal budget it's more just a a pretty um a fairly uh accurate accurate um recording of what i spend and what i think i'm going to have to spend and right i think it makes much more sense and i've recently uh yeah gotten out of debt and everything and i'll probably keeping start keeping a little better track of it i just uh yeah yeah spent whatever came in and and uh didn't never knew what came in what went out but uh just you know like about like the government runs right yeah sounds real similar huh so i think it's probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dad's was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something that's what it was spent and um oh my yeah that was put over there and i mean uh of course he's from the depression and uh yes so uh you know it's his life but uh i i would i think it'd be smart if somebody would keep uh sure some sort of a plan that works for them yeah i think you're right um well it it what's been sort of interesting to us is to um it because since i have uh pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look and it's real fun to just see what how things have changed over the years uh for instance yeah it is i'm a historian and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty seven and my goodness but he burned the ones from twenty seven to fifty i couldn't believe he did that but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present but oh dear yes to look to have looked back into the twenties and thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that but uh oh yes well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things uh not long long ago i guess it's been a couple of years ago in an old trunk that she had and she came upon a budget a budget book that she'd had back in the thirties uh when they it was the late well i guess it would have been i take that back it must have been the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time um-hum and it was just fascinating uh fascinating to see how little things cost i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course it's all relative of course but oh i know right right uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a price pair of shoes was uh like five dollars and i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had had traveled in Europe a lot and i what i'd paid for hotels um and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty and that's really crazy because that's about thirty years ago oh oh isn't that something really oh that is that is really really something oh but but of course it's just what the market'll bear and if people if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten you know yeah that's true yeah that's good that's right that's exactly that's just good old economics working right right that well uh we've tried to uh instill some sense some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night night and day and our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that um-hum she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so closely closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop um-hum um-hum yeah well then you never know how they'll one they they may switch flip flop when they get to be uh older well older the other one may be very careful and yes right yes yes she may marry somebody and of course it'd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then she'll have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think yeah i think that's true i and and it's i kind of think that's sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and yeah uh that really paid off because when it time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in in fairly good good shape financially as far as not having many major debts and yeah that's about the way it is here if it hadn't been for my wife i would have probably been in debtor's prison if we had one yeah so but uh what does you husband do now well uh he is an engineer he's uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his PhD so we had a a lot of lot of years of budgeting oh um oh yeah you have to do it when you're in school my wife's still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it and i've got and you know yeah when you uh yes well i'm working i'm working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three two both of the children were in college our son has a year left our daughter graduated this year and i'm uh just about ready to finish my masters degree so um um we've had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us oh i i know we had three in college plus my wife so that was four so we're both in the same but uh yep yeah you know exactly what it's what it's like then and it's uh yeah yeah which you learn i guess you figure that that's an investment that is um really a invaluable invaluable um-hum yeah and that's the best one yeah with education you can't take that away from you that's right so it's it's one that you can live through and i think that that's way we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school is that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that right sure that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well i've enjoyed talking with you Jay yeah that's true yeah i have enjoyed talking wit h you Kathy and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me i'm interested in that well if i had your address i'd send you i am also in the travel business i do tours and i can take some real great tours to Europe so uh if you oh oh wow well my my husband and i just were there last year um actually we didn't take a tour we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and and did it on our own but yeah um i uh that sounds interesting do is your business in Dallas then yeah it's in Dallas it's here in the Quorum so i'm i'm Jerry Hammond and i'm out at Brookhaven College so you could just holler at me out there yeah okay oh you're kidding well i'm going to be teaching at Brookhaven in the fall Kuenzer K U E N Z E R and i'm i'm going to all right well what's your last name K U E N uh-huh Z E R well good i'll uh and i'll be in the communications department teaching uh English one O one to i have a couple of sections yes yep that's the guy who hired me yes oh well i know Zack Miller real well so uh all right well wonderful i'll look you up in the fall then well fantastic good well it's good it's been a good talk conversation uh-huh bye-bye okay bye-bye  okay i guess we're ready to go uh what are your favorite types of restaurants okay we enjoy uh various types of restaurants uh there's some excellent Italian restaurants here there's some good Cajun cooking of course there's always steak and barbecue right and barbecue right uh do you eat out quite frequently oh not as much as we used to but uh still at least about once a week really and where's the last place that you went to eat let's see we ate at Louisiana Purchase up in Plano just recently we had a craving for catfish and uh they have some good catfish there uh-huh and uh we enjoy there's an Italian restaurant over in Garland also called Taste of Italy i don't know if you've tried any of those there's about four of them around town uh-huh no i haven't but it's good home style Italian cooking it's not the fancy veal and things that you get at some of the other Italian restaurants um-hum they make excellent spaghetti sauce and little garlic rolls and things like that oh and i also recently we had Jacolya out at Addison cajun cooking okay uh what areas do you usually eat in do you find north Dallas and Richardson and Plano area we live out near Richardson Square Mall oh okay so it generally in that north side of town do you ever get down to Deep Elm or Greenville or McKinney yes there's an excellent uh i guess it's Tai it's one of the Southeast Asian type restaurants down in Deep Elm uh West Wind or i've heard of that i've heard several people say that so it must really be i think it's part Vietnamese or something yeah yes i believe so i am really not sure exactly what style it is but it's very very good now right in the edge of North Dallas there at uh Skillman just north of LBJ there's another Vietnamese type restaurant called Yoli's Y O L I S um-hum okay which uh serves some excellent food too in that in that style of food so what would it's not a fancy place i've eaten their lunch primarily uh-huh um so what is your favorite restaurant in Dallas oh that's hard to say but the ones that we like most are out of business now but unfortunately everyone else didn't like them quite as well right um right but Papillon is one we go back to quite frequently for uh continental style cooking we haven't tried that one i uh we belong to the Passbook uh Club oh right um-hum and so we tend to use their coupons whenever possible and i know that's in there and i'd like to get over there i think you would enjoy it it's a tad on the expensive side uh probably run uh with dinner and uh some drinks about twenty five thirty dollars a person well when you have a half price coupon it's not quite so bad then it helps quite a bit right yes we have used some of the coupons also at some of the places but uh that is i think one of our favorite our our most most favorite restaurant was LaLouve which was here on uh in north just off of Central Expressway in north Dallas but that's been gone several years now um-hum uh well it's just a shame all the restaurants that you know open and close you seems you go to one and find one that's your favorite and the next thing you know it's gone it's gone right it's well i heard that there are more restaurants per capita in Dallas than there are in New York that doesn't surprise me i know it's they're everywhere people eat out in Dallas like i have never seen yeah well we we've enjoyed it the there've been some excellent restaurants here through the years and of course some go up some go down and uh it just depends on the chef in some cases of course yes have you been to the new Sonny Bryan's down in uh uh West the West End no i haven't uh haven't been to that one well i have not been to the old one for that matter but i thought that since there's a new one opening perhaps it'd be easier to get into yeah yeah well again the the old Sonny Bryan's up there by uh what is it by uh Methodist Hospital is it like over on Lemmon or something okay up on Inwood uh yeah that one is not really it's it's it's a it's a barbecue stand really it's not really a restaurant well that's what i understand you sit at school tables or out on the hood of your car and um-hum that's right they make some really good barbecue there well that's fine for the summer but i don't think i'd be too interested in the winter right but uh i used to live work over on just off of Stemmons and we'd go over there about once a week for barbecue for lunch uh-huh but uh there's uh oh there's a lots of good restaurants here i think the really hard thing is you want fresh seafood of course uh we're a little bit away from the coast not as far as Kansas but um-hum well i'm from Saint Louis so believe me it was harder to get in Saint Louis than it is here you're right yeah yeah but uh for seafood just all around good eating seafood Vincent's has some really good seafood you know i go by that place all the time over on Midway yeah well there's several there's one in Plano one on Midway there's one over by Love Field i think all right there are three or four of them here in town and we've gone to the one over on Midway and also to the one up in Plano matter of fact let's see we were there New Year's Eve at the one on Plano um-hum we'll have to try that sometime because uh yeah i think you'd really enjoy it well we went to or i i went to Ralph and Kacoos for lunch one day and i've heard good and bad about that The Guide always reviews it very poorly uh-huh yeah but what i had and then uh the two guys i went to lunch with they both let me taste what they had and it was delicious yeah we had dinner there we have a group of friends we go out once a month with and we had dinner at Ralph and Kacoos last fall i think um-hum and we were there and it was excellent the night that we were there well you know how these restaurant reviewers are oh yeah i think their tastes are jaded it depends on whether they got the meal or not yeah right well i guess we probably have talked about our five minutes worth i think we have i certainly enjoyed talking with you well and i've also written down the Taste of Italy we'll have to try that sometime uh you'll have to try it don't expect anything fancy that's all right with me it's home style food it's not expensive and uh get the dinner salad with the olives on it okay and do they have good lasagna so yes my wife swears by the lasagna okay okay okay okay because that's my husband's favorite yeah they have excellent lasagna and if you get like spaghetti with uh get with the Italian sausage it taste like home made Italian sausage you'd get in Chicago okay great yeah thanks for the tip bye-bye thank you bye-bye  okay uh do you work outside the home no i do not okay wow have you yes uh-huh do you have i uh no not actually okay well yes i do in fact i am at work right now uh and so let me take the lead uh Angela uh i think okay what is really important uh of course salary is very important because that's why you are working for your for the money but job satisfaction to me is also uh very important in having a job and uh one of the things that uh she asked us to discuss was benefits uh i'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you right okay and so we could we could talk about uh that path you know how important you think his benefits are and and and uh how important you think they are and if what would you like to see increased in his benefits like uh perhaps uh he has uh okay the benefit of having eyeglasses for the family uh uh and how much coverage uh it provides and also your hospital coverage and uh um probably dental how important you think that would be right i i think that job wise benefits are important just as important as salary is because they of course if you did not have them you would be pulling from your salary of course right right exactly exactly especially when you have a family with children and you are always going to the doctor for and they always have surprises for you with children you know and so it's it is uh exactly they always do we could not do without the benefit package from from any company that we worked for whether they be a conglomerate or just a small uh uh business yeah i think any any even if your insurance policy is not the greatest you would still have something exactly you you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time right just by yourself also for working women yes uh i think a lot of the companies should start providing for day care in the in the in the building uh-huh they are getting a handle on that in fact uh my oldest daughter is uh is uh a nurse and she just received her masters degree and she is now into consulting and that's one of the areas that she is working on to have uh uh a day care center for the individual the children of the of the nurses that are staffing the facility right and that is true in many many areas of you know uh job titles yeah and professions like in may case i have three children uh-huh from ages nine to two and it's just unfeasible for me to try to get a job because all the money that i would be making would be going to day care sure would it would it would be just futile and it would be just basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care center exactly and they would not have the quality and they would be deprived of their mother yeah no i understand that totally besides which it would be easier uh there's a lot of single mothers out there now from divorces and a lot of women are starting to have babies without a partner and to go to work oh i hear yes that's true you are worried about your child besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care and if they were in the same building right uh-huh then you are going to the same place and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child or you know and take your breaks with your children or something yes do you do you think that you should fund that if they have that as a benefit if you would fund that somewhat from your salary that you are getting do you think that would be i think that i think it would be fair i think if if the company could not provide it all on their own for the for the people that would be using it you know a certain amount of their salary would go to it but it would still probably be cheaper acceptable i do too right that you right that's right with the company than than having to go with the company helping our if everybody you know pulled their own weight in it that's correct that's right yes i agree with that i think it would be really really great that would be fair yeah yeah i do uh and how how do you feel about uh let's see eye care eye care is good i don't i'm not sure i don't think we have that on our policy okay but uh we vision i guess it's called vision care yeah it would be great i mean uh the glasses that the exams themselves are not expensive it's the glasses it depends on who has examines your eyes yeah that's true if you have an an ah optometrist or an ophthalmologist there's a vast difference in those two uh professionals right now like my right well like my mother she has to go for testing cause she has got glaucoma well she does not have it but she is like on the verge of it or something her eyes are changing and she has to be tested periodically and and those are expensive tests oh oh okay so yes uh-huh yes they are now i think your insurance covers her on that but you know for something like that uh-huh uh it that's just as bad as a medical you know that's right that's critical because she's in need of it so often yes right and you know we have uh needs in our life that are unique to us and uh you know people have needs in their life that unique to us to them right i mean we are all different so now i i would like to see bettle better dental insurance to me was that our beep well no that's my other phone oh huh so that's it that's okay my that phone is ringing to an empty desk and she's on vacation so it's okay okay but with the three children uh-huh um orthopedic care um not orthopedic orthodontic ca re that's very expensive because on on a lot of the dental insurance they do not cover that well for the the orthodontal stuff yes that's true orthodontic work is terribly expensive especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth and yes it is uh-huh and you have to really get them when they are young in order to have uh not uh a decent smile when they are fifteen sixteen years old right i know two of my daughters had to have that and they started having extractions at age eight uh because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth yeah and we footed the bill because there was not any such thing and when they were young right my middle child needs to have uh orthodontic he's because his his pallet is squared not rounded oh uh-huh and it affects his speech a little bit not not anything you know uh-huh major right but just enough that his bite is off a little bit and it's like four hundred dollars and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it uh-huh well i tell you i i just read an article in the paper about what they are doing i think it was an ad in in our publication at Texas Instruments where they are breaking the jaw and and lining the jaw up with the teeth it's it's less painful and less expensive oh really yeah that sounds like it would hurt more i i know but it it's it's uh easier on the patient in the long run which amazed me oh gosh i i would much rather that do that to myself than make my five year old go in and do it that would kill me  well this is the season for vacations and uh i guess for places i like to go i enjoy going to the beach and having having outdoor being outdoors somewhere and someplace that's very different than Texas and uh as far as right maybe maybe as the summer heat comes along i'd sort of like going somewhere where it's not so hot and being able to be outside and enjoy outsor outside activities so yeah enjoy going places where i i enjoy playing tennis so i like to have a tennis court there or or if it's at the beach the beach is great a pool is great and uh where where do you usually go oh well let's see we have plans this year to drive up to the uh to Colorado and we'll be going to Estes Park and Colorado Springs so um-hum hum uh-huh one year we went to the southwest corner of Colorado into Durango and north of the area there and uh uh-huh boy that's that's a nice nice place to visit it's really nice uh there's a nice nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining right and uh and then actually north north of that is another town and a smaller on a smaller scale i guess than Silverton but uh and then there's lots and lots of real uh of mountains that are covered with uh boulders um-hum so i guess people Jeep through that area and we didn't have a chance to do that but i sure would like to go back there and do that again right we're um uh we haven't had a vacation in several years so so be our first chance in awhile in awhile uh we're going to go to uh Destin Florida which is a very nice beach area if you're not familiar with it it i haven't been but i've heard it's wonderful oh it's it's gorgeous uh we used to go quite a bit uh before i moved out here we were closer and uh used to go almost every summer uh and just just rent a condo there on the beach uh there's quite a few uh there's a lot of development of of condominiums there along the beach front right and uh so they have uh they're very very large condos and they have quite a few rooms and uh so we we'll usually rent one for about a week or so and right and the beach is nice the beach is really nice isn't it and go down oh yeah it's it just uh just beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water and uh a lot of oh nice waves usually uh sea shells enough enough to make it i'm sorry sea shells uh there's not as many sea shells along there uh that's the only thing that they really don't they have some but not not so much um if you go further down uh yeah but you'll usually find some but not right in there uh i don't know why it is but uh just it seems not to not to have as many there but uh we we enjoy it uh it's the place where we stay is we stay we usually stay at the same place every year and they are like i say right on the beach so it's uh oh where do you stay and my husband always wants to go to Destin we just haven't gone that direction yet it's a place called Jetty East uh J E T T Y E A S T and it's uh called that because it's at the very end of uh a jetty there which is uh sort of the end of this little little point and uh it's a at the very end it's the last set of condominiums there and it's uh okay it's very nice uh it's not very expensive uh you can i think we're going to go with another couple and their their kids and uh they have a we have a uh i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom uh condominium which will sleep i don't know quite a few uh six or eight and uh right because it's got you know pull out couches and all that and uh i think it's going to cost us per couple about three hundred dollars for the week oh that's nice yeah it really is because um the uh you know it's got its own kitchen full size kitchen and everything and this one i think has two baths and it's the one we got is on the uh on the beach side so right oh nice we've got a beautiful view and balcony and uh just you know really it's really a nice stay uh in fact we stayed there on on our honeymoon we i had won a trip to the Bahamas but didn't get to take it on our honeymoon time so we instead went there uh and loved it just as much as as if we had gone to the Bahamas we in fact we stayed an extra day or so because we liked the uh the particular room uh uh uh oh uh suite that we had gotten was very nice and so we decided to stay right oh but uh it's a pretty nice place you'll need to try to go and and stay there sometime but well we've just we've just it's a little far from here but uh are you driving yeah we are we're it'll take uh a day and a half to get there probably oh so well well we're uh the neighborhood that we live in they're switching to an alternate calendar this year so it starting well starting at the end of July we'll have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March uh-huh so that'll be interesting turn on vacations for our family so uh uh what does what does that mean alternate well it's what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation nine weeks of school three weeks of vacation oh uh-huh and uh in and in the summer would be more like a two month two month break right so and they hope to boost the they hope to boost the learning of the children i see just the retention of the material for them so uh kind of scattering the vacation out throughout the year yeah yeah so yeah um uh it so anyway so maybe maybe within a year we'll see how that falls right we'll head for we'll head for Florida maybe in somewhat of an off season instead of summer right so uh okay well that's probably need all we need to do today okay all right so long thanks a lot bye-bye  okay what uh TV shows do you like and what do you watch well i i tend to be a a uh sports news and uh not very many of the modern sitcoms uh-huh what about what about yourself well uh i like a variety of things you know uh the like the sitcom wise i like uh Major Dad i'm in the i'm in the Navy so i kind of you know can associate even though he's a Marine officer i uh i you know i kind of associate with that a little bit and i kind of like the way it's done yes um i like uh Cheers i don't get to see it as often as as i'd like to though uh uh let me see what else oh there's some on HBO that i've uh i like it's a Tales from the Crypt they're kind of like those you know those Alfred Alfred Hitchcock Tales from His Crypt type of things i like watching that too um-hum and uh i just uh i like you know enjoy the horror or the mystery or whatever just kind of seeing you know what the twist would be and uh same thing i like if i catch old Twilight Zone and stuff i like those so well what i find is that outside of uh well sports because i'm a sports fan is the the ones that i do watch is uh Saturday Night Live uh-huh yeah except i i wish they didn't have so many reruns right right and otherwise we're caught up with uh because we are pretty good at sitting down to dinner in the six to seven o'clock period uh good ole Wheel of Fortune uh-huh uh-huh which is uh an interesting combination of a a lot of luck and uh the it's probably as good a program as any for the audience to play along and see if you think you're smart or smarter then then those folks are right uh i have a family that is very much into sitcoms and and i have to at six o'clock uh fight getting the news on versus uh having the channel changed on me because they want to watch Cosby or one of the other ones that right right running on one of the uh the off channels uh-huh well that's uh i don't do it so much now i guess in the last year or so but before that i would at the same time thing were happening to me in front of the TV at a certain time i was watching Jeopardy uh Jeopardy um-hum and i thought that was kind of interesting you know trying to answer the questions and you uh you learn some good things i thought you know pick up some interesting facts yeah certainly more educational than Wheel of Fortune right but the one uh that slipped my mind but the one that i my favorite TV show right now i would say is Star Trek uh The New Generation uh-huh i really enjoy it it's uh it's uh you know i thought that i really liked the old Star Trek and this Star Trek uh is so much better you know of course the uh special effects are better and the the story lines just seem to be really good and it's it's uh i really like it enjoy it um-hum and i but i always you know i i got to start getting into the habit of trying to record it on the VCR because i always forget you know the kids bedtime is a little after it starts so i kind of lose track of time putting the kids to bed and uh so i always end up missing it um-hum but i do like that show a lot because it follows uh follows a good story line yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older i'm in my mid forties now but uh uh i guess from my vantage point i think the quality of TV has gone down or else my interests have changed because there were there were various series over the years that i would always make sure i watched and yet i find that now i'm there's hardly anything that that except Saturday Night Live that draws me to say i want to try to watch that i may watch something just because it's on but i uh um-hum i tend to go more to the educational channels if there's uh something that seems interesting there i just uh as i say don't find the modern sitcom very uh um-hum well just very appealing to my interests well there is a lot of things that interest me too that i catch catch you know as i'm i flip through the channels on the Discovery Channel and i do like a lot of shows on that yeah yeah yeah do you get A&E yes uh-huh uh-huh because that's one we don't have cable so uh there's a few things i miss because i don't have cable and A&E is one whenever i'm on a business trip uh-huh and they have it i find that it has things that are uh that interest me they have a lot of series uh i guess i'm into uh i'm a history buff so with all their reruns of uh the aviators over the ages and uh who built what planes and all that was uh right that type of stuff interests me uh-huh yeah that's uh one of the things here is we we we kind of have to have cable here with the reception in the Virginia Beach area you you maybe if you're lucky get three channels okay hum and uh otherwise uh if you want anything more than that you need to get it you need to get uh cable TV yeah i guess that varies from place to place being in the Dallas area because we have we have about seven without uh cable and then with cable who knows how many you can get right right seven seems enough yeah yeah that sure is plenty but uh let me see what other oh there's a new TV show out called Dinosaurs did you catch any of that uh i've read a little bit about it but uh i haven't i don't even know if it's running here in Dallas It kind of shows the level of interest i have in looking at the TV schedule what time's it on there well i i don't know that it's showing anymore i thought i saw it show once or twice i saw the first one you know because i was interested in seeing what it looked like and it wasn't really that good i mean you know the muppet stuff was really was was okay but uh um-hum uh-huh the the comedy on it wasn't wasn't very very funny or anything and uh i think it might have been cut already because uh same with you i haven't really paid attention but i hadn't seen it you know just glancing through the TV Guide or whatever um-hum so it might've been cut and uh i thought that was surprising being a new show and i'm sure it cost a lot of money to make well they do but it it's amazing these days if something isn't making it the word of mouth uh of people talking to each other can cause a program which gets bad reviews to uh to uh not last for very long and even though they did invest money in it um-hum um-hum that they uh it's i think the comparison is like baseball managers this year they seem to uh say two weeks in uh you've had your chance time to uh yeah since you aren't making it we're going to find somebody else yeah that's true how about any of the other shows like uh you know Thirty Something or LA Law or or uh what Shannon's Deal i guess is another one well you know LA Law seems to be real hot and in fact because of the particular business i'm in i'm not a lawyer but i work with lawyers a lot um-hum and the lawyers seem to be very much into watching it and yet i again i have to say because of uh um-hum uh i have not watched very many episodes of it um-hum uh again it's i don't know what i do with my time but i certainly don't spend it watching uh TV in the evenings right right well same here usually it's already by the time we get everything done it's uh time to go to bed um-hum but uh i've caught that a few times you know Thirty Something and all and uh and even LA Law and usually the episodes that i watch you know i'm not a fan of it or anyt hing  i guess we are just to discuss trials and and punishment if it's to be given by the judge or not did you did you catch your explanation of that okay yes i did it's it's uh the uh the uh maybe i'm a hard liner but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases rather than uh degrees of sentencing you mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime right right uh again having participated in jury duty myself i know i know how such a diverse group of okay yes i did also people get together the different backgrounds different ideas that sometimes you can have one person or two that can hold up what i consider the proper sentencing of the person person right could you hang on one minute Jim thank you yes ma'am i am so sorry to keep you on hold are you at work okay i am too no problem yes yeah um i think what you have is the way the um the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty so many things in their back pardon yes i know oh it's insane it's insane my wife participated in a jury trial several years back wherein the individual after it was over and they had came up with the maximum sentence yes yes in the jury form they found out that uh the gentleman involved had a long history of the same type offense which was theft of uh property right uh-huh oh yes and yet the district the attorney for the prosecution could not enter these uh the good man's background into it it was like this was a first time offender yes whereas uh i think that's those that should be in jail should be in jail it seems huh that's correct and there's too much leniency there's too much uh um underhanded uh things going on that the public are not aware of yeah and it seems as though we are uh giving the criminal the benefit more than the victim the victim has been victimized twice not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also the courts that try to do the justice well i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a a unsavory reputation shall we say i do not have any i don't have an ounce in my body of credibility toward the the judicial system in the United States yeah well what you got is the situation wherein uh if you ever get in trouble you want to hire the smartest crookedest lawyer you can find isn't that terrible and uh that's not the idea it's the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime that he committed but to punish him for the crime he committed well to punish him for the crime but also to try and reeducate the man's thinking yeah to get him out of that uh uh criminal mind that he has and to direct him into a more productive life yeah well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery um oh yes how sad and the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes carrying a gun in her purse uh-huh and anyway it'd get to the she was sentenced to jail but then due to technicalities she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced oh of course it took eighteen months for the thing the trial to happen so right then uh there was a letter writing campaign that went in and the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone and uh fortunately it worked they uh eliminated they corrected the technicality and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to well if yes if enough of the public responded to uh the direct the uh parties that are involved and if enough they will listen to the voice of the people i have found that out that if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done something is going to change right people have to be involved this is it and most people don't take the time yeah that's right and again the only reason i took the time is because i was personally acquainted with these people i'm just as guilty as the rest in that respect that's right you were yes uh but and i'm not making an excuse but we our priorities are a bit backward oh yes well they again the and i'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that but we've gone overboard to uh protect persons from being having their civil rights violated to the point where the person that is damaged is not protected it's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person that commits the crimes that's correct yeah yeah yeah okay i think we're both in agreement on this subject well i am too i mean i i just can't i you know i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem and we found her not guilty because the lady obviously was not in their right mind so if the person is not in the right mind i mean they had to uh put her away yeah but for her own safety and for because she didn't know what she was doing and we couldn't we just dismissed the case you know and and she was uh taken care of by the proper yeah facility yeah well another side of the coin that with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court yes that's true which uh or should never have gone to court and then the amazing thing of course is how uh some cases can come to trial in thirty days and others it takes eighteen months  hi Pat hi one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my age my generation were trained and taught and brought up to be the Leave It to Beaver housewives but we are not living in that world uh-huh uh-huh we are certainly not our families have changed uh-huh families uh-huh oh yeah sure society has changed everything has changed yeah yeah uh-huh that's one of the and it makes you really concerned i am glad i raised guys you know let the world train them what to do uh-huh but characteristically you know the women are trained or have been in the past trained in the home uh-huh and i really would be at a loss to to raise and train a girl i think i would yeah it's well even even raising boys today is different though because they are expected to do so much more than they used to you know used to be they would just go off to work and come home and you know everything was done and it it's a different world oh sure uh-huh uh-huh it's some good some bad uh oh sure uh-huh it's nice that there's a choice i i have chosen to stay at home and raise my children and i have a ten year old and a twelve year old uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and i was a single parent for awhile and worked uh-huh and that was great i was able to and i was able to provide for my children and and you know that was wonderful uh-huh uh-huh but i um i thank God everyday now that i have that choice and that i am able to do things at home and and uh i volunteer a whole lot sure uh-huh and uh that's my job right now and i i love it i really love it uh-huh oh yeah i did very much the same thing until my boys got into high school and said mom please do not be involved right right then i went back to work right and that will come i know that day will come and i am looking forward to that too but that's a different phase in my life and i am i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now yeah sure right right well you know there's a lot of things that have happened actually and and it's it's it's like the it's like oil on top of water it changes but it's never different in a lot of ways uh-huh uh-huh uh women at one time did very heavy physical labor uh-huh and were expected to maintain a household uh-huh then as times changed uh as it is today we do not do a lot of physical labor even in house even in housekeeping and homemaking there's not a lot of physical labor because there are uh-huh right right right you are not beating rugs you are not right doing laundry by hand and that kind of thing uh-huh right and in that respect we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion or we really do develop some health problems uh-huh uh-huh so in in that in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit yeah yeah and uh but don't you think it's that way with men too i mean you know men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more oh absolutely true it's that's true with society in general than they used to yeah yeah but specifically the woman's role in society has changed and you know medical medical reports tell us that women are developing uh-huh diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases heart disease was characteristic of men now there's almost equally predominant in women right right right right and i and stress disorders and things like that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right and i think that that's a that's a symptom of our society it's a symptom that there's there's a general illness that needs to be healed uh-huh i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem i am not i am not God yeah yeah but i i do know that in raising my boys i really did meet a lot of pressures saying you know you need to get them into music lessons you need to get them into sports you need to get them into this they need to be busy and they need to be active uh-huh uh-huh and i fought all of those things i said if those boys want to be involved in that they will come to me and they will say mom this is important to me i want to do it otherwise i will guard their ability to have quiet time right right you know it's funny i refused to cram their lives full and that's the way it is with a woman too yeah yeah it's funny it's funny i was really i was really looking forward to summer thinking oh we are going to have some time off and it's been real busy and actually today is really the first as far as i am concerned the first day of summer uh-huh uh-huh because we have had so much going on the past few weeks uh-huh uh-huh and uh you are right uh well that's how society has changed uh you know uh uh-huh uh-huh the family has changed we you know we find ourselves doing things that we never did as kids uh-huh uh-huh well you know i do not remember being involved in things like this it's it's different it's just uh-huh uh-huh it's just i do not know only time will tell whether it's better or worse than the way we grew up but uh it's it's just very different um uh-huh of course uh-huh well i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time if you do not have the time to talk to yourself who are you going to talk to right yeah yeah yeah and i guarded my children's rights for that and i think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do uh-huh they are sacrificing their time with themselves there's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored if you thinking internally and you are working on your own self you are finding out who you are right right r ight but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and get homework done and you know where do you find the time well i think um well in the first place it's not your homework it's your children's homework uh-huh and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help i helped them with exactly what they asked for and that's all uh-huh yeah that's a part of the problem that women have always had and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities that's very true and then that way we have not changed in hundreds of years have we yeah they they that's right that way husbands are crippled yeah they are intellectual cripples and so are children they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible for themselves uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh for themselves i do not know why God made women brilliant i didn't he though yes but i do not know they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems they are all things to all people and that's never changed that's very true that's that's very true i as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday who said she has a new policy in her home and when her her family comes to her and says fix this you know i am having a problem with you know another member of the family she said i have taken a new stance and i say no i will not you know you work it out for yourself uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and she said it's amazing she said you know every single person in this family expects me to get and they drain suck me into these arguments and these conversations and i have i am supposed to be uh-huh that's right the one who is going to fix it all and and soothe everybody and she said i am not doing it anymore i i just uh-huh you know i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful and i think every woman ought to deal with it or ought to at least be exposed to it and that is mediation training um uh-huh uh we are not talking about strikes or things we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises parents and children husbands and wives uh you know boss and employee those kinds of things uh-huh uh-huh interpersonal mediation because the mediator is an unbiased bystander who yeah yeah  hi Maureen hi uh we are supposed to be talking about children and spending time with them today neither one of us have any children but it might be interesting if we talked about what we thought we would do if we had children or perhaps you know what some of our friends do and what we approve or do not approve of yeah uh do you have nieces and nephews or anything no unfortunately my husband and i are both only children now we do have like some cousins that are we're kind of close to and sometimes we see the cousins' children uh-huh you know that's going to be the closest nieces and nephews that we can come up with is our cousins kids they do not live close to us but uh uh as a matter of fact we were going to ask uh his one cousin to try to make plans to have her uh kids come maybe visit this way for a few days and of course you know things sometime you get to be the uh the tourist folks and we will take them to Six Flags take them to Wet N Wild i mean they may not be real quality time but it will be fun though yeah it will be a real treat for them you know to kind of come and do that because they live in East Texas so they will be something real out of the norm uh-huh and i used to uh used to have a neighbor in one apartment complex i lived in and she had at the time her kids were like eleven and nine and five and i used to spend a lot of time with her and her kids we used to go to the pool all the time it was an apartment complex so we used to the pool and you know just kind of play around and do uh water games and you know uh have picnics out there that kind of stuff that was our normal thing we also uh she had gotten one of those uh laser disc players and we used to get uh some movies which is kind of hard with kids sometimes to you know uh-huh get some movies that are enjoyable for the kids and not always a strict Disney thing you know when you get eleven and nine year olds they want something a little more active than a cartoon i'm sure try Milo and Otis Milo and Otis what is that with the animals like the dogs uh-huh the dog and the cat i have seen bits of that like on uh cable or something picked it up i think somebody was showing it recently uh-huh it's really good my husband and i rented it and as a matter of fact we kind of like shows like Bambi and everything sometimes we will go to this theater and we are the only adults you know and we spend money but Milo and Otis is good and i think any the whole family would enjoy that um that sounds cute well we had one silly movie that we used to watch a lot because they were kind of expensive when she got that player uh we did not have too many movies we used to watch Airplane over and over and over again i mean have you ever seen that movie yes it's real silly yes but um and it's it's fairly clean there was only one little section of it that they probably edited for TV but uh we used to watch that a lot i mean that was just real kind of flap stick kind of fun stuff we used to watch that with her kids probably some of that went over their heads anyway some you know you know there uh her kids i remember one summer cried all summer long they wanted to go to Six Flags you know and they see these ads on TV uh Six Flags looks wonderful and we took them there and then they were too scared to get on the rides oh so you got to walk around and watch everything they wouldn't get on any of the rides even if they were you know tall enough they did not want to get on any rides and they cried all summer long when are you going to take us to Six Flags i want to go to Six Flags you know they kind of chickened out well i was noticing i have my husband has a nephew uh-huh and uh i i would say that his mother is probably like one of the perfect mothers she it's just one of those kind of deals that she spends a lot of time with him she listens to what he has to say and he is turning out he is thirteen he is turning out to be a really good kid uh-huh and i think uh whatever she has done you know she has done it right but i think it takes and awful lot of time and effort to raise kids too uh-huh uh-huh you know i watch our neighbors and everything they do is child related hum uh it's like their whole social lives kind of flow around where they are taking the kids and what they are doing with the kids uh-huh um which may be part of the reason we never had kids oh but they are time consuming i it appears to me well you know one thing that that you know i kind of say we have only been married a couple of years but um you know i think so many times in the past you know like even forty fifty years ago i mean it was just expected or kind of pushed upon people you get married and you have kids uh-huh whether or not there was something that inside you really wanted to do and i i like it now that people make the decision you know okay i am going to be married and then yes or no whether i have children it's not so much a society dictating to you do this you know it's everybody is supposed to get married and have kids if you do not want kids fine do not have them right people are beginning to where they do not view you as such a social pariah anymore yeah but uh well you still get you know particularly if you are around a bunch of people with kids they still tend to look at you a little strangely if you do not have them but i am running into more and more people who have opted not to have kids uh-huh so i do not feel quite so bad yeah i mean uh you hear people well there are some people that marry later and then they are very set in their ways and there are activities that they do and well i really do not want to make that sacrifice i have you know been single all these years and or you know we have been married and we have all of our activities and i do not want to change my whole life uh-huh or i came from a family that i had a very bad childhood and i do not know that right now i could have children and and cope with it i have too many bad feelings with my own childhood and maybe i will turn out to be you know abusive like my mother was uh-huh so they say you know i i do not feel that i want to do that which is fine you know i i think that's a wonderful decision on their part if that's how they truly feel uh-huh not you know everybody saying when are you going to have kids it's none of your business that's right it's my option to do that you know you do not just have ten kids because you know you are supposed to somehow as of the old days right or you do not know any better or there's nothing available yeah my mom was from a family of of ten and she was the youngest and her dad was like sixty when she was born and she said you know so there was hardly anything from her father oh my gosh there was like twenty years between her father and her mother her father was sixty and her mother was forty so you know it did not make the best situation for her you know to have uh you know good family kind of situation there she had brothers and sisters that kind of like pushed her around a lot because they were so much older uh-huh yea h it was not the best situation but yeah who yeah plus when they are that old you know it's not as though they are going to go out and rough and tumble with the kids like a younger parent would right right although i mean we are we are in our late thirties now my husband and i and we are still considering it and you know i think that i have kind of done the right thing i mean i have i was just really shocked to have a cousin who is a bit younger than i and she was one of these types out of high school you know  okay so what were you saying do you work with do you work around children when you work with computers no no not at all i work with computers yep they what one thing i okay do you have but you have friends that have children i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually that have been uh-huh what is child care like in New York what is uh i do not really know excuse me too much about child care in New York does the company you work for have child care on premises for the employees excuse me one second huh-uh no not at all in fact my situation is a little bit strange i was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile have just come back and was doing consulting work so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now uh and and i might oh oh my a sabbatical well i hope you can stay as long as possible with yeah well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home and if i can do that it will yeah i'll be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care oh that would be wonderful right right but uh i might start to go crazy with it too it is a little i i miss the intellectual stimulation right but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now and i think it does when when they're real little and they're changing every day there's and you just miss the little things and and uh oh yes yeah well i think for me the important concerns i do not think i would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person uh-huh uh-huh i wouldn't want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young because i think a little infant just doesn't get the stimulation they need uh-huh that's right maybe if if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that because like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when there's two year olds running around the whoever is taking care of them the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds and only when the infant screams are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with that's right that's right right and you know i play with her most of the time she's awake and i think that is so important right well that it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother this is yeah well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important right and uh our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a Montessori day care system and they took infants starting at six weeks and they have a program uh uh-huh in that was devised by this Montessori person and uh a certain type of stimulations and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they they lay quietly and look at certain things they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright and and uh they have different things they'll they'll put them down on the floor and of course they never have more than like five uh-huh and and they'll put them down on the floor and they will have oh i think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know and there's something about their eyes uh-huh yeah well she's she's just been doing all kinds of stuff where she's you know uh how old is she now oh yeah she's two months now nine weeks and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and so every days are different and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and uh-huh i'll probably be going back to work around January whereas she'll be about eight or nine months old and so i think you know she'll be at a i have heard it's a roughage to put them into a um it is because that's when they're clinging to mama so you might have a real problem with that yeah i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place but that's unusual but but i think it yeah we're just going to have to see how things work out uh but i'm trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that she's used to other people taking care of her uh-huh is it your parents or your husband's parents my parents my husband's parents are in France so it's a little bit harder but during you know she she she's met them already oh not that she will remember them but she's met them right right that's nice when uh i my i have three grandchildren another one coming in September and i it would if they were where i couldn't get my hands on them i'm afraid i would probably go crazy i you know i i like that but if it you do not have to put them in child care that's uh-huh are they all nearby that's an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time that's that's wonderful for the child yeah but right and you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to well if i work part time that might be doable look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer drop in at times that are unexpected the yeah well right now the situation is so tight at many places that it's even hard to have a choice uh uh incredible but you know since this is people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids and you know i just find that incredible and my sister-in-law is going to have a baby very very soon and she's intending to stay home with the baby uh-huh uh-huh oh and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis i'm hoping i can leave my daughter with her because her daughter you know again will be a couple oh that would be wonderful my daughter will be about six months older than hers and you know it'll be a little rough when she is a very very little infant but like when she is a month or so my sister-in-law has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families and so uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh oh she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we could might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work right right right uh-huh uh-huh uh and not be bothered we might be able to exchange that way uh -huh and so we'll just have to see how things work out but i think the whole you know ideally i think the businesses should have the day care centers there whether it's the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether they hire a couple of people and uh you know parents come down to supervise or whatever i do too really well trained people right and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if there's an emergency that person in charge knows CPR or first aid or um yeah oh yeah and and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know that's real important to little kids yeah well she's my daughter doesn't seem to be on a real schedule yet and it's probably my fault because i do not have a real schedule now but uh-huh they they adjust to what the parents yeah well she's been staying up late at night and you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me uh-huh we you know that works until they start school and that's a problem society is geared to a a day person and it's right i have uh another friend who's brother and his wife have done this they stay up until all hours of the night
