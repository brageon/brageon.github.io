 well how would you rate it uh well i'm kind of in the middle i lived in the Ozarks for a long time where a lot of people do a lot of hunting and uh um-hum now i live in Dallas where there's a lot of crime and i'm all for uh the average Joe being able to have a gun but then again i'm not you know as far as this seven day law and all this stuff for two weeks or whatever i'm all for that too i don't think anybody needs to be able to go buy a gun right away yeah if you want a gun for a legitimate purpose you should be willing to wait long enough for someone to verify that you're not a yeah that's true yeah that that's true i'm i'm kind of like you you know i don't i'm kind of in between but i i'd rather not rate it at all because i think it's very site specific a potential criminal yeah and i i don't think you know i think it's one of the constitutional rights that is important and you know we we should be allowed to have guns yeah i don't think they should turn around and say you know the government says you can't have a gun because that just i don't know right it doesn't make sense if if you can govern yourself any any any country where they've ever revolted you know it takes guns to revolt and sure we don't need to but uh never know there might come a time so yeah well i think you know it's like you're saying is you know were in in places in communities where hunting is common yeah you can't ban guns there it's not it's kind of impossible it's a way of life for people but uh in in cities i think there there may be a possibility for certain law restricting firearms in certain areas maybe not the ownership of such but it's restricting the you know the the uh presence of of hand guns in certain areas well they do that now i mean you're not supposed to have a hand guns well maybe you're allowed to have them say in the city but you're not allowed to use them in the city limits and things no that's what i'm saying like not have one in the city like you can have one but you can't have one in your apartment if it's you know cause you're in the city like you may have it at a summer home or somewhere else yeah just because you live in the city doesn't mean you can't have it but you just can't have it in the city well what does that do to people that uh use it for protection like you know i personally i don't have a gun but i wouldn't mind having one i live in a neighborhood where the crime rate is going up somebody breaks in my house i wouldn't mind having a gun you know in self-defense but uh well yeah well you know i see i don't know the statistics for that for you know how if if by having a gun how much that really helps so i don't really know that's why i think that maybe if not maybe not just having one will be better that's that's why i i wouldn't know because i'm not from the city so i don't i don't see the very high crime rate you on the other hand may have a different opinion yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock right right you shoot them exactly as you know as i'm i'm from uh you know rural yeah so i i go hunting a lot i think there need to be stronger gun control laws that can be that can uh that uh what am i trying to say in in cities in urban areas uh-huh but uh i don't think guns should be banned i just think it should be harder for for a criminal to get hold of them and of course the black market anyone can get one if they want one no yeah the bad things is that you know when you try to make it harder for criminals to get them how do you know if you're selling to a criminal or not well that i guess that's the whole point of some of this legislation they're they're trying to make yeah yeah i mean you can't you can't ever really determine that i mean you can sell it to a straight person and and then he becomes a truant yeah yeah that's like shit he turns around and yeah turns passes it on yeah there's no perfect answer but i guess i'm i'm more for i'm more for no i'm actually more for less control because i think it's it's a right that that i would hate to see us lose more for some kind of control huh yeah well i don't want to see it and the more the more you give gun control the little bit the little bit of time before long you don't have anything i mean i'm sure when they started out with taxes they didn't plan on taking thirty percent of your income but uh but it sounds good to them they just start with a little bit you know yeah well i think you know maybe some kind of condition some kind i think they should ban uh automatic weapons for you know only only and restrict them to uh gun clubs only i don't know if they've they've completed that action or not yeah i don't know what the deal is on that i know you can't buy them any more you can't can't buy imported ones anyway right and well uh i mean that doesn't really matter imported or or you know domestic machine guns they still do the same damage or is it the other way around right right i don't see i don't see what the difference is myself you know getting shot by i don't see any reason for anybody to have one unless they're fighting a war you know i mean in a gun club or something you know in a gun club or or have the wrong reason in mind those two are the right right that's why i think that maybe you know you if you say you can't have an automatic weapon that's that's also saying that you can't have a gun so if you say you can have it but you have to be a member of gun club that that restricts it even further doesn't doesn't take away your right it just puts a restriction on your right right but i don't you know i think i think restrictions are going to be needed but no no bans or anything like that it's kind of hard though because in different regions different regions like you were saying is uh is different like there where you're at you wouldn't mind having a gun so you you're really yeah i wouldn't need an Uzi though you know yeah or a UB forty i mean a a pistol would be fine it's more for a scare tactic than anything else right i don't really want to shoot somebody but i guess if uh it was me or him i would have to yeah it's a good deterrent course you've got people that are pulling them out on the highways down here it's like you cut them off and boom blow you away so you have to draw the line i guess yeah i don't know so if we're supposed to pick a number i'd guess i'd pick oh what no gun control was was ten well total ban is one and uh no ban at all is ten i guess i'd have to pick about an eight something down there toward the low end yeah i think i think well around seven or eight restricting certain kinds and and leaving others out with restrictions but i don't know what that you know like you were saying the uh the seven day restriction or seven day wait period or something like that well supposedly in seven days they're going they're going to look through y our background and make sure you are not an ex-con or don't have what does that mean that that really doesn't you know it's just because it gives them time to look you up doesn't mean i mean it it it may be well intended but i don't know how effective it is yeah i don't either it might stop some people but some people with a history of something but uh you know i guess there's a lot of information out there on everybody whether we we believe it or not they know everything you've done for the last ever since you got a social security number really yeah that's true so uh i guess they've got some time to make sure you haven't been in prison or don't have a history of you know i don't know so then it's it's uh up to the the individual dealer i don't know i really don't know what the the actual on how how they work that out i imagine with the the way everything is computerized now it won't take much you know a perspective buyer comes in and they throw in your social security number on some nationally network system and it based on whatever criteria it's got it says yes or no this guy can get a gun or he can't and whoever decides those criterias you know that's something the legislatures do yeah but what does does the uh does the retailer have the opportunity to you know disregard that information that he receives i really don't know i don't know what the you know what the status of those laws are because you know if if it's if it's not against the law for the retailer to disregard that information that kind of defeats the whole purpose of the seven day wait period yeah i would think if they're going to make a law it would have to be something uh national it'd be a crime to uh not enforce it right and oh well man i guess that's about five minutes all right uh all right nice talking to you Ralph Ralph bye take care yeah bye  okay anyway so what have what have you been into did you watch LA Law last night uh no actually i i don't i i don't uh it's funny i don't really seem to watch a lot of television what um i usually like to pick up on TV are some of the news type of shows like you know 20/20 60 Minutes uh-huh um unfortunately a couple of weekly soaps like Knots Landing and uh Dallas we watch and uh and i usually uh i just other than those i i catch movies once in a while i like a lot of the movies that are you know true stories true to life that type of thing uh-huh um but i'm not i'm not real big on that much on television uh i don't have really many favorite shows that i i must see every week you know yeah uh part of that i think is uh i have two boys and you know usually i don't get to sit down to watch the they they they get first crack huh yeah yeah so uh anyway um but how about you then well i usually i guess a lot of the sitcoms uh-huh Cosby Cheers uh well i find i do sit down with them when they have those those they like a lot of those uh shows and often when they have them on uh uh-huh that's when they're quiet i like sit sit down with them and watch it yeah yeah A different A Different World a Different World yeah but some of the other ones like i've been getting into L A Law and uh uh-huh do you watch uh Thirty Something no i don't make a point i i guess i really never make a point to to watch anything i'll just end up catching it but uh yeah so you catch whatever might be on if you're interested that evening yeah you know if i'm not doing that night uh yeah you know which i guess is usually most nights no uh-huh yeah yeah but uh oh speaking of 20/20 you didn't see the one in with the exorcists exorcists uh um i you know i wanted to and i forget i really i kept seeing it advertised and i wanted to see that and i don't know we might not have been home or something excuse me and i didn't see that but i was really interested in in that i i found that a pretty interesting story that they said the church recognized that as as a real exorcism uh-huh uh did you see that show yeah i did and what what did you think what did they what uh was that all about oh well the girl that supposedly was possessed uh had actually uh you know seen uh you know something uh some medical the medical side i don't know if it was a psychologist or what all but uh-huh um you know it was interesting interesting it's interesting uh and uh you know i'm from you know i'm was raised Catholic fairly you know fairly fairly strong with my mom and dad so yeah my husband is too yeah but it you know that's kind of interesting um but the bottom line it you know they did the exorcism it wasn't real major you know she she was fairly you know she you know obviously there she you know she something was wrong with her uh-huh but uh it wasn't really uh you know extraordinary as far as her actions and she had done that and she felt like that helped her but at the same time shortly after that exorcism they also started um um um uh giving her medication for like a split personality type stuff of oh okay so uh she's doing better but and and the girl herself you know believes that it you know that she was uh you know possessed but and you know it it's hard to say hum it could be a multiple like one of these multiple personality disorders yeah i'm not i'm not sure you know who knows but uh anyway it wasn't uh also yeah huh you know it was uh it was you know it wasn't as dramatic as i guess maybe they made it seem well i i can't say it wasn't just because of the fact that that it's pretty unusual for something like that to be nationally televised uh or or have anybody come in you know who who would want to have that televised you know if that was happening to your daughter right and well right right and also and her parents are right there you know doing it all you know so yeah um and also for the church to recognize it as a a true exorcism you know um usually they're such i think i really think that there's a fine line between what um you know a lot of people think is possessed and what are really mental disorders you know and maybe in the old days you know many years ago what they often said oh people were possessed we probably recognize now as schizophrenia or something um uh-huh um and uh you know it's it's it's hard to to say you know whether it's it's just a it's a mental disorder or it's really uh uh it's a or if it's a split personality or something yeah wait honey i can't talk right now uh but um what i don't know now what area are you living in i'm in Phoenix Arizona right now oh wait Jackie what yes okay okay go excuse me so are you in Dallas uh no we are uh outside of Washington DC oh okay and i was just the reason i asked that i was curious i thought maybe in different parts of uh you know the country maybe there were certain shows that were more more popular than in other parts and i know in this area it's i don't know DC is especially the newer areas are really known for having so many yuppies you know and a lot of them are into Thirty Something and you know yeah yeah uh i don't know some of the other shows they watch um Twin Peaks you know and i'm not really into those shows and that really surprises people yeah i i never got caught up in Twin Twin Peaks either so yeah yeah and i just i was just wondering demographically if you know if different parts if there were shows that were more popular than in other areas i don't know like where you live um you know what are the real yeah what are the hot shows you know that everybody seems to want to watch uh i don't know i don't hear people talk at work you know uh-huh as far as uh you know what what people are getting into but um you know some of the top sitcoms obviously do you know always in the top five you know the Cosby or i think A Different World is real strong and yeah uh-huh uh now that's funny see i haven't even heard of that show that's just yeah well that's the one it's the one right after Cosby and it's produced by Co sby and it's about it's basically about uh college oh is that right so uh oh okay you know and it it obvious it's you know since since it's kind of promoted by Cosby it's you know mostly blacks i see uh-huh but uh but it's it's a pretty good show it uh and are all the kids into the Simpsons have you ever heard of Jasmine Guy pardon me uh yes okay now she's one of the main stars of that and now she's just come out came out with an album oh okay and uh and which is fairly successful she's got one or two singles that have done very well so but she is a very strong personality in that show uh and uh uh-huh i see it's your basic college and what people run into and they in fact they just had a show covering AIDS and uh oh is that right so you know they try to get their messages across i should say yeah now there's a new show on and i can't think of the name of it apparently the producer of it was a Potomac resident um you know which is right right around here close to where we we are living you know the Potomac uh-huh area outside of DC and and i i think he went to like Wooton High School here or something and and some of the papers that circulating the rumor that this show is based upon stories that actually happened at Wooton High where he went and that's and he she denies some of it you know um i oh eh eh i eh it might be the Beverly Hills um there's that one called Beverly Hills one O two one O or something like that uh um not sure and uh that's becoming a little popular and of course the kids all like the Simpsons here yeah and uh i guess it's the same there also yeah uh that one is is it still competing with Cosby um i'm not sure i don't know what's happened uh i know a lot of some of the parents won't let their kids watch it you know uh such a brat yeah but um it what what uh what changes would you like to see i mean in in in you know evening television do you think there should be more like news type programs like 20/20 or more comedies or weeklies honestly i'm indifferent i probably i probably will watch a little bit of everything uh i i i i get into movies i'll uh i'll see you know i'll watch 20/20 or i'll you're indifferent it doesn't matter yeah uh-huh uh you know i guess i'm only mostly into sitcoms i guess my favorite you know one show i'm really into is Arsenio Hall uh-huh oh yeah i watch that uh-huh and uh and then you know i've been watching him for a long time now and i i needed a break and i watched Johnny Carson last night a little more level you know and so it's like i'm just yeah think oh what do i feel like today you know we're getting option our options on different talk shows and i always liked watching Letterman but he starts so late you so you like some of these late shows yeah well the the talk shows with the personality yeah and uh yeah yeah talk shows yeah but uh Letterman starts pretty late out here about twelve o'clock uh-huh right oh oh okay but i'll still watch it once in a while yeah yeah um i guess so i think also probably because people now there are so many uh everybody has VCR's and rents so many movies that might have i don't know that might have hurt some of the the popularity of certain shows you know a lot of things that they put on Saturday nights a lot of people yeah  well as much as i'd uh i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or a or a four by four or something i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door what kind of car do you have now oh we've got a uh an older Delta Eighty Eight and then uh our our newer car is a uh a Corsica and uh we'll probably be looking for something about that uh that same style that same kind of four door hard top style and yeah yeah you got kids uh no but we're planning for it so uh in fact uh our Oldsmobile is a is a like an old Delta Eighty Eight but it's in pretty good shape it's in really good shape and we've been really pleased with Oldsmobiles that's probably where the first place we'd look okay yeah yeah huh but uh well we've always had uh Fords uh mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a Ford dealership uh-huh that'll do it yeah that'll do it um but yeah we're we're in the same shape i think our next car will be a you know some big old four door uh something that can haul the kids to baseball practice and piano lessons and we've got a minivan yep uh-huh and that's great and i drive i drive uh well i used to drive an Escort but it died on me so i i mean i i i used to run it i uh where we used to live i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day oh jeez and uh and this Escort took it all and its it it got up to uh uh i was at ninety four thousand miles on it and the engine just went um-hum so i i bought i bought a used um Dodge Aries yeah which has been okay i i mean i haven't had it that long but it it'll it's an eighty five Aries but it only had thirty four thousand miles on it when i bought it really um-hum oh jeez and i just you know i just drive it to work so it's just a ten minute commute everyday um-hum so um it doesn't get much of uh i mean it's not like i'm putting it through its paces but i think uh and it's a four door which is nice but it's still a little cramped i've got three kids yeah yeah um-hum yeah yeah sounds like you you need at least like a Taurus size or something like that so i i yeah that's what i was thinking of was a Taurus um yeah i i know i know a lot of the guys at work they uh the ones that have uh families uh and they still want kind of a sports car they've been uh a lot of them been getting these uh Taurus SHOs that i guess it's the sport version of the Taurus in fact it comes with a standard stick and uh oh really yeah ooh and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh yeah and usually they're in like black and gun metal grey and and those kind of colors you're not gonna see too many uh you know green ones or blue ones or anything like that they they put them in sporty colors i guess but uh yeah yeah well my wife wants a Miata oh well sure that's what you know until till you look at the price tag and then you go what what would i really besides tooling around and looking really cool and having a lot of fun what would i really do with this car if it what right right yeah i know i know it's like i i guess i could fit in it maybe yeah i i went i went through that when i first got out of uh college i had an old car that i bought just to get to to my job my first job yeah and when i got there the first thing i did was trade it in on a Spitfire and i i knew that was gonna be the only time i could afford a two seater uh sports car no yeah but that that just does not make it as an only car it's uh it's like i bought i would i bought a set of stereo speakers yeah and it was one of those cash and carry deals and i had to take them one at a time with the top down and it was winter so i was like in this coat with the top down and the speaker in the passenger seat oh no and i drove that one home and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the passenger seat and drove that one home and uh funny funniest sight and you kind of outgrow that real quick when it's your only car yeah yeah well i you know it's funny most people that i've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college or you know or when they were single anyway they'd they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last i never did that uh you know my first car was a Toyota Corolla um-hum yeah oh really and uh because i got a good deal on it and uh that was a great little car actually yeah i met that's how i met girls was i'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission which i i'd never i i'd learned on an automatic transmission and so so i'd go out on dates where they would teach me how to drive this car uh-huh boy that's a good deal and uh in fact i married one of those people and it worked yeah it worked all right real good ah okay well i'll have to remember that if i ever get in that situation again huh because i i know we've uh that's that's something that that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission my um my wife just does can't can't can't uh she doesn't really wanna learn i guess the uh the standard shift in fact i i remember once we uh yeah yeah we uh went uh went on a uh test drive we got one of these things from Lee Iacocca that said you know i'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll test drive a car and we went uh we went uh yeah yeah we went to a dealership and uh it it was it was pretty she she did pretty well but it was one of these things where we just went to a big parking lot and the uh dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking because that's all it was it was it was the funniest thing it was like a yeah a big Le Baron it was a Le Baron with everything on it but it had a standard shift it was the craziest thing i ever saw and and and that's probably why they were trying to sell them i guess wow that's weird yeah huh and uh we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth she did pretty well after a while but uh it's it's kind of hard to learn i guess yeah well my wife i mean she'd always driven standard transmission and uh and and in fact all our earlier cars were standard a standard transmission in fact the minivan's a has a stick shift um-hum okay and in fact this Dodge Aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything you know it's got automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the Dodge Aries you know so uh oh jeez yeah yeah what the oh well well i guess that i guess that's about all i got to say about cars well um the the thing about this uh the i will say this about the minivan uh-huh we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it it it uh-huh i would think so yeah because it's so big yeah and and it was quiet it had a stereo system we never had it you know we always had the AM radio and uh course this had stick shift it had speakers speakers that you can control from the backseat oh yeah sure sure um-hum and you can change the channels on the on the radio from the backseat too and put speaker speaker phones in it so uh uh-huh now now now that used to be a luxury but i bet on the next time you buy a car that's gonna be mandatory you've got to have that now you're used to it and you got to have it right that's right that's right and you got to pay for it too and i bet and i bet it costs twice as much as as when i bought mine yeah that's true too it probably does it probably does but uh oh well well Bill it's been nice talking to you okay you have a good evening um-hum bye-bye well nice talking to you thanks a lot bye bye  okay um what area do you are you in what area of the country okay uh i'm in southwest Houston oh in Houston okay i'm up in Plano near Dallas uh-huh where yeah do you live in a suburb or yeah i live in uh um well i live uh i live about five minutes from the TI plant and it's in uh a it's in the a leaf area which doesn't mean anything to you but it's in a it's in a subdivision and it's um-hum um-hum yeah uh probably uh i don't know three bedroom house with uh uh-huh you know fenced in yard and it's it's an older house it's about twenty years old i bought it about four years ago and i've been kind of fixing it up and uh doing things to it as i can is it uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah yeah i love it i'm just it's a lot of work though i'll tell you what fixing it up or keeping it up yeah yeah keeping it up and uh i've decided that i was going to try to do my own yard this year so i've uh-huh oh i've you know it takes me three days like come home one afternoon and mow and one day edge and another day weed eat and then my stupid magnolia tree is dropping leaves and the raking and the yeah yep yep oh yeah yeah and i thought wait a minute this is and now it's ninety five degrees almost here in Houston it's horrible but anyway so how how about your house oh boy yeah so you don't want well we have a really large house we have three kids and we bought a five bedroom house when we moved here and um it's getting to be too much too much work to keep it up oh my goodness uh-huh how many kids do you have three three so we have a bedroom for everybody and then we have an extra playroom for them to pile all their toys in and an extra TV up there and the ironing board three kids and you're a working you're a working mom too well yeah i that's the other thing is i was working uh full time i just started back about a year and a half ago and um my youngest one got to be three years old and so then i went back to work and i decided after a year of being a secretary that what i really wanted to do was go back and get my master's degree um-hum and um so then i went to part-time work and i'm going to school part-time and uh it's getting to be too much financially too without my full time income so we're we're just decided to put last week to put our house on the market and um get a smaller house not too small though with three kids smaller house oh man so so that that was kind of a hard decision to make but i think uh i it's just been an awful lot you know financial is one thing and that's kind of concrete but also it's just there it the house is just really big and there there's a lot of kids and a lot of space and it all gets messed up i know i you know i can imagine gee so and with cleaning out to you know to sell the house we're trying to clean things out in closets and the playroom and the garage and everything and when you have this much space you don't have to be as careful about throwing stuff out you just put it in the garage or put it in the playroom or something so it's just we just have massive stuff that you know is we just accumulated too much stuff i mean not that we have a whole bunch of things it's just little junky you know old toys well it it you tend to fill up what area you have you you don't have a whole you know when i moved into this house i thought oh wow because i moved here from an apartment that's it yeah right right and apartments you can't accumulate a whole lot because you just don't have room to put it um-hum there's no place to put it yeah and now you know well you've got the garage you know so going to a smaller place yeah you're going to you'll find um-hum yeah it's going to be great though it makes it gives you a good feeling when you've got clean out the stuff and get rid of it you know yeah you have more control control over it it seems almost like it's taking control here a lot of things in the garage that you know you never use you never want you know why do i keep them there's you know it's just filling up the garage but right yeah yeah it's just because you have to physically go out there and go through it i guess when you so you have to um-hum well i kept kept things that see my children are grown and uh-huh uh some of the stuff you know was from when they were growing up so what you know you hate to throw it out but they don't want it and you know right but i'll probably keep it keep it a while but it's it's amazing how a house yeah get yeah uh i don't know how you do it with your children and although i you know it's crazy well me i did it too but yeah yeah but oh it's it's a tough deal i think well i don't i really have uh really relaxed standards about how well organized and cleaned it is i mean it has to be basically clean because you have to be organized enough enough to know where things are to be able to find things if it gets too messy you spend your whole life going through trying to find what you need um-hum so i learned that it has you have to maintain a certain standard of cleanliness but i mean organization but i i mean compared to the other mothers here on my street that don't work i mean my house is just it looks horrible compared to theirs but i mean you have to decide what you're going to do you know if you going to that's right what's the most important thing yeah so that's what slides for me that's right you know you have to decide is the house going to run your life or are you going to run your life yeah you just right exactly but it is it's it's it is a lot of a lot of work yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and it's all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didn't have the money we didn't have the time to really decorate it and i was said to my husband if we had a smaller house it wouldn't take you know hundreds of dollars to decorate one room it of you see we did this one huge wall that we have and it was like three hundred dollars worth of wallpaper and i didn't even buy that expensiv e kind you know that it wouldn't even cost that much but it was it's a real long wall um-hum so if we had a smaller house everything would be smaller and it it wouldn't take well it took us two weekends to put all the wallpaper up you know um-hum and uh but i have a feeling it's going to be hard are you have you started looking for another house uh we have we have driven around in the neighborhood we don't want our children to have to change s chools we want to try and stay in the same school area so we've driven around the neighborhood and we've looked from the outside but um uh-huh oh i still trying to find time to get this house this weekend we're going to finish up the garage and we're going to do you know i have a few other things i need to do here and then after that i hope that this house will be good enough for people to come through and look at it and then i want to start going to some open houses and um-hum and um you know look at some but i've talked a lot with our realtor about it and she assured me we could get you know a four bedroom house in the price range that we want in that area she said you're not going to like it as much as this one i said yeah no kidding well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what you've got in that house you think but um yeah for this house it's just in this area of Plano it seems the the houses are moving really quickly they said my realtor said about three to six months and maybe closer to the three months because we live half a block from the elementary school oh that's a real plus um-hum so that's real nice yeah and it is five bedrooms she said you you it's really hard to find that and most places places have four and there are people that really want five so that's another plus so it might be closer to three months and you know we'll be if we're real lucky we won't lose any money you know we'll we'll be able it's mostly the closing costs that are going to um-hum that you we can we'll be be uh asking for more than we bought the house for three years ago but the closing costs are going to eat out just about all of it so so maybe you can get enough to cover that yeah then we'll feel really we'll feel good about it so are you you you you're basically going to have to sell that one before you can so before we can look too much yeah or commit to something else anyway right that's what that's what our realtor wants to do i've talked to some other people who have put contingencies on their houses uh-huh and um but our our realtor just doesn't really like to do that she doesn't even want me to go out and look and fall in love with something until you know i yeah oh really i would have thought you know at least go and start looking at least to know well i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to tell her you know when i have the time that's the hard thing i have finals right now because i'm taking two classes i have finals and papers and stuff so in um two weeks from now i should be pretty well set and uh i'm going to go out there and look i'm going to tell her i i want to know i want to have a feeling before i sign saying i'm going to sell this house i have to see what exactly it is that we're going to be moving into um-hum um-hum um-hum so but i trust her pretty much in that oh yeah you know she knows what we're looking for and she knows what's out there so yeah so how about in Houston how is it down there well well i think uh you know i think uh real estate houses are uh it's it's selling much better than than it than than they did i think new homes new homes in certain areas uh you know are are are doing very well uh and i think uh is it getting better um-hum um-hum when i bought this house was actually it's be in May it'll be five years and uh um-hum this was uh a foreclosure a foreclosure foreclosure and uh so i mean it was had had been pretty bad in this area for for awhile oh yeah um-hum right and and uh i guess over the past year it sort of i got my uh the appraisal you know the thing you get for what they're base your taxes on uh-huh uh-huh and it's gone up from it went down from what i bought it for and then and now it's come back up oh come back up oh good yeah yeah well but then again i i didn't care if it went down as long as i don't want to sell it because then i have my taxes are going to be less but right that's true i didn't think about that that's right yeah but uh but you can tell by just riding around my neighborhood um-hum uh when i bought when i like i say when i bought this house there was oh just many many homes for sale and uh now uh um-hum you don't see quite as many and i and there's a lot of people like i just put a new roof on my house and repainted the outside and uh about a three or four weeks uh-huh uh-huh  Texas how you doing all right good good good have you been participating in this uh program very much oh uh ever since they really got started oh okay uh maybe a phone call a week or something like that yeah yeah i try to get one a day and i'm leaving the country here in next week and i wanna get every i want to get as many as i can uh okay Bill you about ready to get started i guess so uh Bill what kind of a company you with i'm with a electronics company oh okay uh i've been an engineer all my life and uh that's one of the the issues that i have with the company that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an engineer that uh you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company um-hum but uh you know it's uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work that's challenging and find challenging assignments yeah i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh how how old are you Bill i'm uh fifty four oh hey i'm fifty seven sounds like same situation here uh i'm with TI of course and our our benefits it it's interesting uh because that's one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or or other things um-hum uh however recently i've had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards we're probably in the top seventy percent um-hum yeah uh the uh uh i've i've really in fact what i'm doing is i'm uh retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company um-hum uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh i've spent uh eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia yeah and i've just had a real ball and uh since i've been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants which is okay but the other part the other part's pushing paper um-hum and uh uh which i don't like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting um-hum and and i'm going to do that beginning the first of May but uh uh interestingly interestingly interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind i've been with i've been with TI thirty two years uh the biggest gripe in TI is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as i've i've had a chance to do uh it's really not all that bad uh the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess they've all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care um-hum yes i think so and and i i think that's the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill i've been there thirty two years thirty two ha ha sounds familiar what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldn't say restrictions policy yeah well after being there for this long i get uh four weeks a year and i have an option to uh trade salary for an extra week oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks uh let me see how does it work uh after you get two weeks up until five years and then you get an additional day uh each year thereafter up until ten years um-hum and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time you've been there twenty years you get the four weeks um-hum you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three three three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen hum okay and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue none no carryover whatsoever oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or or you lose it right okay well we've got we're allowed to accrue a fair bunch i'm not exactly sure uh on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days um-hum right uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days um-hum which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in the next three days yeah uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didn't get to do that so i'm in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back um but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you don't i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right that's right uh-huh uh-huh that's interesting interesting now we're allowed to accrue sick leave but uh oh okay well see we we don't have any any such thing as sick leave uh if you're exempt and you've been here over three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program hum okay yes we do yeah and we get half half pay uh or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works hum and uh uh that's interesting how how many vacation days do y'all get you mean uh mean holidays yeah i meant holidays yeah uh i don't know the exact count uh they took away some of the minor holidays a few years back and we get Christmas week off oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same so yeah we traded in Veterans Day and uh and i guess Good Friday or something like that uh in favor of having a week off at Christmas i i'm not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at Christmas time because yeah it yeah yeah no i guess that's true i i guess see most of us and like yourself where you've got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it weren't a company holiday you'd still have some time left over at Christmas yeah and uh i i guess what happens is we don't have Christmas week we have Christmas plus a day around Christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays um-hum but there's so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant well i think that's the reason our plant went that way what we we have uh a lot of government contract work and we find that in that last uh couple of week of the year all the government people are use it or lose it situation yeah probably yeah yeah so they're all gone yeah so all our customers are nonexistent yeah yeah that's that's what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle uh seventies and uh uh and that one was the uh Friday after Thanksgiving and i think the reason we got it for a holiday was nobody worked it anyway yeah it just kept us from taking a day's vacation um-hum uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it oh okay which which comes out to about nine and uh and and just since i've been here i mean when i got here we didn't even get Memorial Day yeah huh that's strange and it it wasn't recognized here in the deep South and we got uh uh and Good Friday came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because we didn't get that day then huh and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us Good Friday the the the employees voted for Good Friday it was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring yeah we're sort of in that situation we do get uh uh George Washington's birthday but it's still a long dry stretch from then until uh Memorial Day oh okay so you yeah are are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance uh i'm kind of cross with it this year we changed uh uh managers for the plan we had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield and uh we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system yeah but they've gone to a managed care program and we had to even even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no physicians in the area that are taking patients oh my goodness and it's absolutely pathetic up here uh so far the insurance company owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in my goodness that's tough uh we had uh we've been with Aetna actually i think we find fund our own insurance program Aetna just administers paying the bills yeah that's the way our company works yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed Mental Health Care uh-huh and then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that uh that we're going to have uh uh network doctors yeah and and they're going to the way they're going to work into this is they're going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people and uh write to them all and tell them that they've got an opportunity to be part of this program and they and yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it uh if this patient wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there no kidding  okay well we're official now yeah um yes yeah it's um it's very hot in fact i've been cleaning because i live in an apartment so i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening oh okay oh yeah um you know i have the little flower boxes with um a variety a lot of different flowers and i do enjoy plants but i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening really oh you're you're you're not the so-called expert you need a house i guess to go through all of that i have had a couple of houses and uh uh-huh uh the only recommendation i would have for someone who hasn't gardened is uh one get a couple of good books of books of course and usually they have talk shows here in Dallas they have um-hum uh-huh two great uh talk shows that go through everything that will grow here which is the opposite probably of what would grow up where you are you know so right right uh in fact you you could easily do that now listen to turn on a talk show up there and see if there there's got to be some gardening folks on the radio that says when to put your grass in and and what kind of grass to grow up in Virginia and everything so i uh uh-huh yes um-hum for someone who doesn't garden i'd say that that's my biggest recommendation is to uh-huh so you enjoy gardening oh yeah yeah i like it a lot uh uh-huh uh-huh uh it's a lot of work i'm an engineer i'm i'm with TI you are you with TI up there or okay no no i'm with a defense contractor okay um where was oh yeah no i i like it i uh i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though i mean it is dog work and it is tough uh-huh uh-huh i have a lot of trees down here uh the part i don't like i guess would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves um-hum forever it seems like and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours so uh-huh other than that you know those three months when it's pure dog work um-hum uh the rest of it's very enjoyable just going through the experiences of of putting little plants in or whatever i i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many but uh uh-huh uh-huh uh but i do listen to that talk show there there is some great people from Texas A&M i don't know uh maybe you've heard of A&M down here but there's some great uh folks uh um-hum that have been well trained and again uh to to uh recommend gardening for this area um yeah i'm sure it is you know different in the different areas um i'm originally from Pennsylvania and i do go home on weekends during the summer and that and uh mow my mother's grass and different things like that yeah you probably have rye grass up there we grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here oh i would have no idea no idea whatsoever right yeah see you would have to learn that though see like i said i'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on my window sill and um do you have much luck in the Winter don't they they're freeze it freeze out because the roots are all in the Winter uh or do you have to start all over every year yeah i have to start all over every year well except i do have some um right yeah some day lilies that um um-hum you know i don't do anything with and they seem to come back year after year and i leave them on my balcony even in in the same pot that's that's amazing in the snow and the winter you know in the ice everything because here you know not as severe as the snow is in Pennsylvania but here we still do get some snow and ice and things like that um-hum yeah i grow a few things in pots but we have to bring them in here uh-huh in the Winter because usually uh if it's not below the ground so you can insulate the roots from freezing you know the pots will uh will die everything in a pot will die um-hum um-hum so you can bring them well we do bring stuff in the garage and everything uh-huh but uh it's quite time consuming by the way i don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything but it's quite uh but i would definitely do it i'm all for doing everything whether whatever subject you pick uh do it the knowledgeable way um-hum don't go out there and start digging holes uh right right i agree with that get some books of whether it be Pennsylvania or Virginia um-hum as as well as uh not your neighbors of course they usually know nothing but uh uh listen to still then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper for communications um-hum yeah as well as i bet there's a talk show up there right now that you if you turn the dial around you'll on Saturday this is Saturday that you'll find someone probably in the morning i don't know uh-huh um-hum discussing you know what we do up in Virginia to get something growing you probably don't have to do much over there the soil's probably so good yeah uh-huh our soil's not very good down here we're um-hum i guess in the ice age it it it's pushed a lot of uh limestone and everything some parts of Dallas you just can dig a foot down and you hit solid limestone you know wow uh-huh so uh i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny Appleseed type trees where people have come from i'm sure when the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of of Dallas it's so scrubby um-hum uh and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old uh pecan trees from Alabama and all that too um-hum we we call them native pecan trees but they grow wild here they're eating pecans though pecans are probably not taken from Virginia they're probably only in the South um-hum uh-huh right i'm for pecan pie and all that it's what they call pecan pecan pie up there in in the East um-hum i'm from Pennsylvania and New Jersey i'm from New Jersey originally uh-huh oh you don't sound like it i've worked on that with some chewing gum which i shouldn't do uh-huh um go ahead you what how many times you called by the way or how many times have you been called um i've been called a lot at the times though it's been not very appropriate i guess that i haven't been able to actually participate i've participated probably in about maybe i don't know seven calls um-hum and you know i've called a couple of times but most of the time i notice that um you know it takes forever to get a call through oh yeah today that's what i'm saying today i was i got to laugh because i tried it this morning and uh i thought everybody was gardening i thought well no no this is a great subject because they're out there gardening you know yeah um-hum um-hum i didn't tell you what our weather is like it is beautiful here today uh-huh yeah it's like eighty five degrees here it's not quite that hot yeah we've had a real nice mild Spring uh you might have seen if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were north of us no i haven't uh i don't know if you get CNN i don't get CNN but it's here at work in fact i'm at work today believe it or not uh-huh oh uh-huh but uh they have uh TV's in the break areas um-hum and there was some some heavy tornados uh i guess in Kansas quite a few people were killed you'll see that on the evening news oh my uh-huh i'll have to make sure i catch that uh tornados uh which is not the right subject but uh they blow through here all in the Spring i guess it's related somewhat to the weather you know and and the plants and all that that uh sometimes they do essentially nothing um-hum um-hum and the weather men yesterday were all alert say hey there's something really terrible going to happen and they they sure were right but it wasn't in Texas it was uh-huh north of us yeah look at the news tonight they'll they'll they claim thirty odd people were killed up in Kansas City Kansas somewhere i'll have to make sure i catch that uh uh-huh anyway back to planting uh i have never studied it is very interesting uh subject uh when you when did you get a house uh you your trees grow up so well up there but i'm sure you have plenty of trees um-hum that that is a key thing for shade uh-huh and keeping your bills down uh i guess you have mostly pine trees but where in Virginia are you all um right now the District Washington um in Fairfax Virginia it's fifteen miles west of Washington DC um-hum oh do you have the cherry blossoms and everything there or not yeah there's there's a few not you know nearly as many as what's actually in the District but um they're definitely enjoyable right now i know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful yeah oh yeah yeah azaleas grow all over we grow those here too although again we have to prepare the soil um-hum you probably have nice big pine you probably have all kinds of trees the oaks and everything that's one thing i noticed about yeah there there there is a vast variety here of you know trees like if i look out my window right now i can see you know couple of pine trees some oak trees um-hum yeah have you ever been down here um no actually i haven't okay it's it's interesting country uh it is wide open uh and flat um-hum uh and again as i said i think the when the Indians were here there there weren't any trees but the the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees and uh a lot of them have done well uh they they do have some pine forest areas in west in west in east Texas where you have native pine trees but here in Dallas it's uh um-hum uh-huh i think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed and uh uh Johnny Pecanseed whatever you would call it you know because there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees that we use for you know uh for eating um-hum uh-huh i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop uh hundred and fifty years ago because they are all over the place um-hum in the South what else um oh well i guess that i really don't know that much how many how many subject i i the subjects are usually pretty interesting i i'm i'm of course i'm a TI'er so i'm hoping this works TI is very good uh has done a lot of experiments in the speech uh synthesis synthesis can't say it uh-huh and they've come out with some new products uh some new in fact this week they came out with some new math uh you might see them in your advertisements uh new math uh Speak and Math uh uh-huh uh devices they they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years but they've come out with some different ones right uh-huh this past week and uh my wife and everyone ask me what what are they going to accomplish out of all this and i said well you're not going to have to type on the computer one day you're just going to have to talk to it right uh-huh you know so you it's going to be much faster of course you know the classical thing for the handicapped too person who can't type very fast or um-hum like i can of course um-hum uh not that i can talk very fast either but uh um-hum but then what about people that um i i i personally work with someone that that is deaf and cannot speak she can speak but she can't speak very clearly and she in fact is a data entry person i mean she types away all day yeah  anyway what are your what are your first comments on that subject uh my first comments on the budget i would say there has what would you start cutting first what would be the first thing you'd cut defense surprisingly no i would i would cut the prison systems and let them self-support mean private enterprise hm have private enterprise enterprise do it you mean the prisons uh-huh they're already talking about it i mean they're talking about um having it uh as a you know business uh to uh you know to so the you know the government doesn't have to deal with it i hadn't heard that but uh yeah because i think it's all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obviously so right but um but to me but see they're they don't have enough um um you know there's there's not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to maybe have uh you know private you know business private enterprise come in so well see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be self-supporting like um the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be self-supporting within themselves in other words they're in there for a purpose put them to work um-hum rather than sitting there it's the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldn't say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there um-hum so it's self defense you know self-defense on that point um as far as my defense budget uh they're cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that yeah but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today so i'm lost on that one i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what we've got um-hum yeah its tough to to say what um you know what uh as far as this that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that they so uh well not so much pay i'm not trying to see the government put out any more no yeah i know what you are saying but i'm just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here it you know it's just up to high school yeah but see we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up you know why not an apprentice out to a hum-um a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician you can learn on the job um-hum which of course again which mean would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean it's not going to be overnight yeah but that would come down i think the program you know that's one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh they're not willing to you know to put that you know the training for only a certain amount so um it's you know as far as the technical side but uh even like one one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff i mean they they're trying to get more people into that field but they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and she's training her um-hum well yeah i i'm well yeah i you know i'm assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know i've been with a couple of big companies now and it's like they'd are unwilling to put the time in you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously there's uh uh you know there's a lot to learn uh after that but but uh that's true i'm i'm sure there's a lot of um you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel i've got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up is that better yes wow okay and yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere anyway so um but uh you know i think uh well they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people um-hum you know stuff like that programs like that you know i don't know you know what kind of options they've got well that's something about what Germany's supposed to be doing something similar to that right now and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level uh-huh which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school they're they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around um-hum because they don't have any education i don't mean college and i'm for college but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned they've had it yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree um-hum so i thought that was interesting but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so oh yeah but there's a lot of them out there that haven't yeah well i just you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and so that's yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on and they go to college etcetera well it seems to me that kids that are get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if they're said hey it's just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more they'll make a lot happier life for themselves yeah question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do well as as far as the you know the deficit that's a whole nother uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and there's not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goods you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know we're going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um it's just that uh they're in i think you're you're going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we don't sell you know we don't uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in so were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldn't even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting hum-um  well i'll tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many Orientals that have come here and there's a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent uh very wise in money matters and have taken have taken over a lot of businesses and have really kind it's kind of scary because they're so bright they're all the kids that i have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids and they and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up and money is their main goal and it's kind it really is kind of scary because there's there's just oodles of them and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals and it's kind it's kind of scares me not that i don't want them here and not that i don't appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but on the other hand you feel like almost they're they're invading us to the point where they're going to take over right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution i think probably that's a good idea because i lived in Iowa for about for about ten years before i came here and i was born in Ohio uh-huh so it it really and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because we're so close to the border and and they are wonderful people and and i'm not you know i don't want to deny them their rights just that you you feel like when you um-hum were born and raised here and you worked real very hard to make this country what it is uh it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever they're from and take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies companies companies and it's kind of scary and you know i don't know i don't know the immigration laws that uh that well and i do not and in fact i don't know them at all i don't know how many um-hum um-hum people they allow in the United States per year or if there's even a i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that um-hum no i don't i don't know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh i know a lot of people that were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come um-hum yeah and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places i would think so too it uh you know i i i think there's something about being able to to claim um imminent danger or i'm not sure what the terminology is maybe political uh-huh uh-huh asylum yeah there there you go you got the term and maybe that's an an issue with a a lot of people i don't know asylum of some sort um-hum but yeah i i guess i haven't been in a situation where it's it's been threatening to to me uh well well i teach in the suburb of Dallas and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas and uh with very very good school systems and they're considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools um-hum um-hum and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but uh i think in the last year i'm not if i'm not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh almost half or more Oriental um-hum um-hum and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning i was going to say i'm not sure i i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i don't they uh don't want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they don't want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have right right maybe but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've we've let this value slip yeah i know i agree with that i agree with that and they need to have some competition but what i see is you the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge they're starting to resent them and it's causing you know i think some some problems um-hum well that's too bad it really is it because we see a lot of racial problems in Dallas the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas and it's mainly Black and and and Hispanic um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum but uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because they've started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and there's been some violence because of it oh that's really sad it is it's it is very sad so you know i really i i've i've always prided myself on not being prejudice and being um-hum you know um welcoming welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger when when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything um-hum um-hum but i i've i've become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas um-hum well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change maybe the uh you know the there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society um-hum um-hum well and exactly that's exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too you know you just don't know right right exactly and and yet you know with uh with uh there's somebody on my other line but i'm going to ignore that um oh anyway i just you you kind of you don't you really don't know what to do and and i don't i want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth and both of my children um-hum are really tolerant more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason they feel you know like they've taken over they feel like uh you know they're taking some of the hum the rewards that they should have and and i really don't want that to happen but but it's happening right right right right and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too so um-hum um-hum and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i hi i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because they've changed a great deal right i would i would suspect that they have well i guess um i don't have much much more to contribute to the topic yeah i don't i don't really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant yeah um-hum perhaps and i and even if i i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you don't know any of that and you feel you know you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless um-hum right and for some reason Orientals are very uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth um-hum goal directed well pardon me yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they goal directle oh i see um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they don't think anything of that and i don't you know that's makes people resentful too and um-hum sure sure and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but it's it sometimes it's gets touchy um-hum um-hum um-hum so and i'm sure it's a lot different you're from Maryland you said what part of Maryland are you from yes up in the Gaithersburg area oh okay my sister used to live there in that area and i i'm sure that it's a lot different there uh it's a lot different in Iowa than in Iowa than it is here um-hum well no i think i think there as i recall in my son's class there were were an awful an awful lot of minorities minorities yeah and uh of all of all varieties and is that right with the same uh you know some of the some of the same problems that you've mentioned but um i don't know i guess i wasn't involved enough to to um really stop to think about it um-hum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children and give the our American children and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fearful that are fearful too and and it's a kind of a touchy situation um-hum um-hum um-hum and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened but it doesn't happen that way all the time exactly exactly right right so anyway it was good to talk to to you too and have a good trip in California all right well thank you bye-bye well it was good talking to you and i hope okay and have a good weekend all righty bye-bye  i started when i was in college you know they always offer credit cards for college students yes so i went ahead and and accepted every one that i was offered because i knew it would be easier to go ahead and get them and establish credit early um-hum right so i pack i pack around a lot of them but i only use a few of them you have a lot of discipline they make it really easy for people to uh to get credit cards especially college students yeah i have uh two daughters who who both are in college or in fact one has finished now but they both have a lot of credit cards and they give you such high credit limits it's it's easy to get caught up and uh-huh in the minimum payment trap uh right and then they they give you uh uh the credit limit and then you're always seemingly seemingly up to that limit now i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of them and that's that's how a lot of people get into trouble yeah i've got i've got two that i you know that usually i'll have a a balance on um-hum and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an American Express card and and pay it off every month that way i feel like i'm getting you know a thirty day loan right yeah but i don't have to worry about you know running them up too high except at Christmas then they usually go then they usually get run up pretty good yeah well you have a lot of discipline i uh i'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine i i've paid off about four credit cards this year and uh uh-huh but still i have some that are are up to the limit and especially the Visa card that you can go and get cash on it seems like every time i'm short of cash i just go get get it from Visa yeah now that's one that's i've never used my Visa for cash before uh-huh can you use it like at a bank machine or uh it well uh you can go in a bank and just hand them the Visa Card and say i want a cash advance or if they've sent you a uh a number that you can use you know a a personal identification number that you can use in the uh Impact machines or whatever you you can do that yeah oh okay because i have one that i don't have a pin number for you know sometimes you have to ask them for that yeah and then i have one that uh just gave me the pin number automatically now we got that's that's funny you said that because we got a credit card um my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for um-hum then a couple of weeks later we got we got pin numbers and then we got a a bill saying you know uh the yearly fee it was like forty dollars and we we cut them up and sent them back because we we hadn't even applied for them and we didn't want them right but they they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us oh wow so i thought man i don't know if i trust this or not well they they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time everybody in the world will offer you a a credit card it's like let's see if we can get her to run up her bills but it's hard i mean it's it's tempting when you see something to say well i'll just charge it and sometimes i'll do that but usually i i will try to pay everything off the next month or the ones that that usually have an outstanding balance all the time i'll i'll pay more than the minimum payment um-hum um-hum just i feel i feel like even that little bit helps right well you know the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that i think we we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible that's that's why i've i've really started to try to to pay off mine and get out of debt because we never know when we might you know get laid off or something especially me i work for Texas Instruments and they've had had a lot of of uh you know layoffs lately i know it well i work for TI too you do and i think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division where are you in Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City uh-huh i know they're selling out somebody in Colorado Springs yeah yeah they just they just announced that didn't they yeah so i mean it's it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards it it certainly is i've um i have worked on a part part time job um where i was a collector for um uh-huh uh uh a jewelry company people um that they just had this jewelry account it was Zales Jewelry in fact and uh a whole bunch of people i mean they have about a thousand collectors i guess man and uh there's just so many people that have bought jewelry which is really a luxury item and then they they just can't pay for it something something happens you know you hear so many stories listening to them like yeah uh you know they lost their job or uh they they've signed for a friend you know they got it in their name but they got it for a friend and then the friend wouldn't pay them and now they're stuck with the bill and it's ruining their credit and ooh didn't pay them you really have to watch it this you know because yeah because every every month all of these credit cards report to the credit bureau you know automatically most most of them do man that's scary i didn't realize that yeah and if you if you're uh it's bad because if you you know your bill is due on the fifteenth then you're you're not past due until the fifteenth of the next month but yeah oh okay you know if you if you pay one day after that fifteenth you're not one day late you're thirty days late they don't they don't recognize any time difference do they right right and anyway we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of ooh that's scary that's something i never thought about getting you know checking with to see what what your credit report looked like um-hum well you know you you can do that i believe it costs a bout ten dollars might be worth it for peace of mind oh yeah it is it is you might even find somebody's been reporting on you and you didn't even know it you know you i mean you might think you're paying something on time or and you by that day and you're thirty thirty days is not real bad though anyway yeah if you've got a charge off on your credit report report or something like that that's when it really gets bad or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days you know things like that really i think that Discover card has a good idea with you know giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you you purchase as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back um-hum and since they don't have the yearly fee do they charge a lot of interest on that card i don't i don't know i've never i haven't gotten one just because it's i i felt like with Visa and MasterCard and American Express you didn't need another one uh-huh um-hum i would think it wouldn't be you know much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges yeah so that that wouldn't be too bad well always watch out for somebody anybody who bills you out of Atlanta Georgia or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twenty one and twenty two percent interest i know i had a charge with uh Spiegel and i hadn't read the uh terms of the credit agreement really and uh when i did i you know i realized that that it just looked seemed like i was never paying the balance yeah off you know and i looked at the credit card agreement one day and it was like twenty three percent interest holy cow and that's the one bill that i hurry up hurried and paid up and and i've always watched it since then you really have to watch those interest rates definitely that's awful i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to so that's true so anyway they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent i think in in Texas but there there are a couple of states that can well that's great and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of Atlanta Atlanta Georgia i'll try to remember that one oh well well see i was trying to think if there was anything else um so i guess the worst problem i ever had with with a credit card though was um i got a an item on my bill that i had never purchased um-hum i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it and i changed my mind but then they went ahead and charged it on my account um-hum um-hum ooh and it took me about eighteen months to get that all of that mess off of my account wow so that's that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card i wonder if they  so the topic is vacations all right that's a good that's a good topic huh i think so i enjoy them where did you go on your last vacation uh uh the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents it was to what the last one was back down to Lubbock Texas to visit family uh-huh yeah uh but that's not the tradition for us oh yeah what's your out of the out of the state type where do you like to go uh we enjoyed Yellowstone real well last year really yeah what kind of uh vacation spots are there in Colorado oh Rocky Mountain National Park uh-huh it's it's just like any of the other national parks it you know there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching and i think my parents took me there when i was real young we went to Colorado Springs and uh Rocky Mountain National Park it was real pretty oh it's got to see Pike's Peak yeah we usually try and drive up there oh once every year or two you drive by yourself up there sure oh wow to the top the of the peak sure oh that's tough i don't i don't think i could do that oh it's not bad at all it's it's a beautiful drive oh now i admit up there the altitude is kind of interesting yeah yeah you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy but it's fun you know take along a picnic lunch and sure is pretty up there oh we love it you have mountains all around you uh no they're only to the east uh i mean to the west of us where you live uh-huh here in the Springs you know it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies you know and once a week we drive up into the mountains usually you know usually once a week once every other week wow that's neat i'm jealous there's hills in Texas yeah well i enjoy hills in Texas too i've been in Sherman have you ever been out of the United States for uh vacation no i haven't you or business uh once to Mexico City but just a little day thing on business uh uh-huh i went to uh the Bahamas last year on a cruise for my honeymoon uh that's nice it was really neat i had never been out of really out of Texas or Indiana much out of the United States i'm from Indiana so did you enjoy it what did you enjoy it yeah it was great uh-huh it was really pretty down there uh uh got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture and uh-huh yeah really did there in fact one uh family that sat at our table every meal was from London and they had never been to the United States so they were really enjoying it and they were telling us about all their trips oh huh they had been to Disneyland and it was neat to meet different people so the place that i went that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most uh-huh was Seattle oh really i've heard it's really pretty up there well we uh was two years ago uh-huh we went during the drought i'm sorry three years ago it had been dry for a whole week oh oh wow it didn't rain for a whole week yeah that would have been nice that would have been best time to go yeah somehow we picked the right time and uh walked down on the wharf and i think we ate seafood every meal for well not quite every meal but most meals for a week uh-huh uh it was wonderful uh the Pacific Science Museum the little girl really enjoyed it's very interesting Pacific Sites yeah really yes it was it was super and uh went to the Seattle Aquarium uh-huh and it's right down there on the right there on the ocean and down there on the wharf by the piers and all and you walk down in a dome a glass dome uh-huh and the bay is circulating over your head and you oh wow you can watch the fish swim by and sharks oh it's oh neat yeah and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises and oh it's it's amazing that's the vacation you recommend huh oh absolutely yeah without a doubt Seattle is beautiful and the mountains the mountains to the east of Seattle yeah i've heard it is uh-huh are just incredible really i rode a ferry for the first time in my life oh wow you know up there you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry uh-huh instead of by bridge and you drive your car on you park your car you set your brake you walk upstairs and you have a beer oh or coffee or whatever depending on the time of day uh-huh it's amazing and your car is on a ferry and it goes across with you yes yes that's really neat yeah yeah and there are people literally that everyday take the ferry you know and drive on to it yeah to work live on an island off off shore from Seattle huh that's really wild and you uh everyday they drive on the ferry they go upstairs and have their morning coffee huh take for the twenty to hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and you know depending on where it is hour and ten minutes well in some places you know in some areas you know depends on how far they are commuting yeah that's really interesting oh it it's strict i'm i'm a West Texan uh-huh out there in the land of no water yeah and and to think that people live on the water daily is kind of odd to me you know it's it's a different life style than we are used to yeah it is i've been wanting to go to the West Texas and see different parts of Texas because i haven't lived here very long and i haven't really seen much so what are some good things in Texas to go visit oh Galveston Galveston yes i liked Galveston real well uh there's uh one of the areas down there close to Galveston is i forget the name of the island but it's a bird sanctuary uh-huh with all kinds of wild birds whooping and sand hill cranes and ducks and pelicans and it's very pretty uh i like the Rio Grande Valley uh-huh real well of course you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone to the uh to the Alamo yeah Boardwalk and all that yeah the river walk oh it's yeah and you need to go in the Spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there oh it's just simply beautiful i've heard it's really pretty and of course always when i lived in West Texas had to annually go down to San Antone just really yeah and go to uh Lone Star and uh you know make my annual pilgrimage to the Lone Star Brewery and yeah uh uh El Paso is kind of neat in kind of a funny way you know go across the border and all uh the Davis Mountains are interesting uh-huh out there in West Texas down by Big Bend what's that yeah yeah uh now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter okay because there's a beauty to the desert that it can most be it can best be appreciated when you are not burning up yeah you know whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at it's most enjoyable to get you know to get warm um uh-huh that's nice uh down there in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf that's interesting i love the Texas Hill Country yeah and uh and uh Austin is neat for for an occasional visit i've heard to go to Austin too a lot people say to go down there yeah yeah it's a fun few days uh what's there to see in Austin oh UT is real pretty uh-huh uh there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area Marble Falls and all that's real pretty uh i would say definitely go see that part and uh i'd say go to uh Midland once just for the heck of it i don't know why exactly but uh you know find out when they are holding the petroleum fair uh  well i'm having a hard time remembering the last movie i saw well i was too i i thought i saw a lot of movies but i guess i i haven't seen any really recently yeah i guess uh i can remember seeing Dances With Wolves that was uh well that's uh that's an excellent film i i highly i highly recommend that in fact i guess they're bringing that back out well i haven't seen that that's what everybody says oh are they and uh they're adding fifty minutes to it or something like that see that's why i don't want to go see it because it's three hours just to start of it i can't that's right i can't sit through a movie that long so it's going to be almost four hours before it's over i know i don't think i'll see it or beyond yeah beyond that uh well i hear it's a man's movie anyway oh i wouldn't say that no because i my wife my my wife and i went and i think she enjoyed it even more than i did really oh really so uh unlike Field of Dreams i guess the last Kevin Costner movie we'd seen before that was Field of Dreams i i guess i'd have to admit that probably was more of a guy's movie than a oh was it yeah than a than a lady's movie well it's kind of like you know Steel Magnolia is to me was a woman's movie yeah yeah that's what we we saw that and i have to agree with you i think that's more of a lady's movie than a than a guy's movie yeah uh i was trying to think of the last movie i saw oh i saw i saw Ghost that was good but uh oh okay yeah we saw that on video that's that's that's another thing i guess that uh it's kind of oh did you kind of curbed uh us going out so much is that uh there was so many movies i didn't see when they came out beforehand that uh i know are coming out on video that you yeah going out yeah you look in the paper and you and you go well i can either see this or i can see this movie that i really wanted to see three years ago and didn't see right i want to see Silence of the Lambs have you seen that i haven't and and i i hear it's excellent i i hear it's excellent and it's probably something i'd i'd enjoy but i i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldn't like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie yeah yeah uh-huh uh-huh and that in fact i read something in the paper here the other day that uh Anthony Hopkins i guess the guy who plays the the psycho or the villain that uh-huh right that uh he's getting letters from just all over you know the world and all that and and he suddenly become uh like a real screen idol or a uh oh really like a a leading man you know he thinks it's funny but i guess uh woman in particular think it's such a scary movie and that uh that uh-huh oh yeah that they just identify with not identify with him but they they like his character i i wouldn't say like like his character but they're so fascinated by his character that uh they write him letters and and say how much they liked him and things like that yeah that's what it is um-hum well this guy at work told me not to go see it by myself at night or see it by myself at night so i that's probably that's probably a good idea unfortunately i think i i don't really enjoy movies with a whole lot of blood in them so uh i don't either i myself i like romantic comedies myself but uh yeah yeah i'll i'll go see a drama like uh when the Untouchables came out which is another Kevin Costner movie well this is going to be a rut isn't it yeah my gosh you're you must be a big fan of his i just so happen i guess we just see those but my wife actually talked me into going to see that and i didn't really want to go see it and it was you know it was kind of a a bloody movie but uh it was done in such a way that you know uh-huh and with gangsters and guns and all that i mean you are not going to avoid that so wasn't as yeah i it wasn't like they spent you know long shots relishing every drop or something like that yeah i guess the last movie i saw was at Scenes From the Mall with Woody Allen and Bette Midler and i i guess you just have to be a big Woody Allen fan which i'm not i think you either hate him or like him yeah yeah we we we did in fact i think that is the last movie that we saw was Scenes from Mall and and i thought i thought it was terrible yeah so did we we thought it was really lousy and it yeah i i like her but i really don't like him for some reason in the first place trying to pass him off at age forty just almost was too much more than i could handle you know and yeah he he's not forty anymore that's for sure Lord no he hasn't seen forty in ten years has he plus uh plus there's something about seeing those two walking through a mall just like and nobody paying attention is just like no no and especially with him carrying a yellow surfboard that was just like yes huh-uh isn't that the truth this this is real realistic and you know if i saw Woody Allen and Bette Midler go by and he's still carrying a yellow surfboard i wouldn't notice him i wouldn't even see him i believe i would too but and then the money they spent on that food that shrimp or or that sushi or something like hundred i mean eleven hundred dollars or something ended up spending nobody spends that kind of money i don't think and oh yeah it was just a it was just a yeah and i i just can't believe uh that you could use up two hours watching two people go from store to store in a mall huh-uh you know just uh in fact that was the funny part of it was sitting there and just seeing mall shots going you know i could go to North Park or i could go to Collin Creek or something like that and see that so no right right that was a terrible so uh it was just not really fun at all no i came i had asked my neighbor to go with me and she decided to she had to fly so i thought i'll go see it by myself um-hum and i'm glad i didn't ask her to waste her time now because or money yeah i didn't i mean that was a horrible movie i and we went to an early show on that one so we didn't uh in fact i think i went to one of the early shows i didn't have to spend a bunch of money on it i think i got in for two seventy five or something i would have hated to have spent seven dollars on that yeah oh gee yeah tell the truth but that but she usually plays some pretty cute movies like that one with Nick Nolte that was Beverly Down and Out in Beverly Hills wasn't she in that yeah yeah yeah i didn't get to see that i didn't get to see that but uh but she was cute in that and uh i think i hear she was good in Beaches i didn't see that i didn't see that either that was something we'll probably rent a video on one of these days but uh i want to see that movie uh A Kiss Before oh Kiss Before Dying or something like that i've just seen advertised but i guess i haven't kept up on the movies that are out right just coming out right now you die before yeah something like that i know i just see it advertise on TV and it really looks like it is going to be a thriller a good thriller um-hum um-hum that uh sounds sounds like you are pretty much split between romantic comedies and thrillers then yeah yeah i am i really don't like to see thrillers by myself but uh i will go see them i yeah yeah i guess i guess the only real movie that we we wanted to go see and haven't gone to see yet is is Class Action II with Gene Hackman yeah i want to see that that's another good one because uh he's usually i hear he's good in it but that's i guess he's good in almost everything he does so yeah yeah i know it i've never seen him in anything bad yet and uh so we're we're looking for one of these days to to see that and another person i used to i really did like was Barbara Streisand and then i saw her in that movie Nuts and that was a wasted don't waste your even at a dollar movie that one would have been bad oh i didn't see that no that good i think that's what everyone said that it was a pretty lousy movie oh it was horrible and i really did like her until that uh-huh uh-huh but gosh not any more ooh yeah yeah boy she hasn't been in a movie well maybe that's why she hasn't been in a movie in a long time yeah and that's right i don't think she's made one since then either as a matter of the fact that i know yeah i i guess i guess i don't tend to even though it seems like we've been to a lot of Kevin Costner's movies maybe that's my wife's uh input more than i but uh but i guess i don't rely on anymore on uh-huh star value i don't really go see movies because it's like Robert Redford was in Havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy yeah yeah i know it how about did you see uh Pretty Woman with Richard Gere and i haven't seen that i haven't was that good oh that's good yeah i liked that that was a good movie and that i heard that uh and i don't particularly like Richard Gere i guess the only movie that i that i liked that he was in was Officer and a Gentleman and even then you know that was kind of pushing it yeah but uh but i heard every even if you didn't like Richard Gere you probably would've liked that movie oh i'm a fan of his yeah he is good i really i really did like him i'm a fan of his uh okay yeah he's uh he's okay in my book okay okay and of course Julia Roberts is cute too but i i didn't really know i hadn't heard of her too much until i saw this movie and uh um-hum um-hum then i saw Dick Tracy did you see that i haven't seen that no no we didn't go see that nah it was i heard that was more of a kid's movie and uh well the kids wouldn't appreciate it because they they've never heard of Dick Tracy other than you know like i've heard of him all my life but yeah when you when he was actually in the funny paper and yeah but they don't know him except for uh probably uh the movie you know so i don't think they would appreciate it as much as as older people would because they you know grew up with him but i was kind of disappointed in it a little bit uh yeah that's true that probably yeah i i probably couldn't get my wife to go see that i think the last time i got to see her something like that was Batman it took me a it took me a yeah and i didn't like that you know why i didn't like that movie it was so dark i couldn't see well that's true i think that was the feel that they they were after was everything was really dark and and and kind of foreboding and i guess and i don't like to have to strain my eyes and try to see the characters on the screen that that was one i i watched on a video at home and i maybe that was it maybe yeah uh-huh that that might have been something because i think that i don't think that's movie that would have been as good on a on a small screen no i mean you really it really had to be on a big screen i think especially for Jack Nicholson to come across because because i mean what he did was so corny yeah yeah you know like it it's like they they spent a half hour setting up that line about bats in the belfry you know it's where Batman is climbing up to save what's her name and uh-huh uh-huh and he's up there and it's like all these things are are falling on him and it's like they they work all this time just when he gets to the top that the Joker can say something about well looks like we got bats in the belfry and it's like well i think they've been pushing to try to get this joke in for a long time yeah i hear a i hear a second Batman movie is getting ready to come out too yeah i guess Danny De Vito's in it uh-huh yeah oh is it oh now that would be good i like him oh did you see uh War of the Roses i guess he's yeah i no i loved it but most people that i knew didn't like it but i thought i was funny i i liked it till about a half hour from the from the end it looked it looked like it was going to be a funny movie and and until about until it got to be almost too much uh-huh oh well now that was the first movie i or the first movie in ages that i have seen twice i went back to see it and when i saw it the second time it wasn't as cute but it was i just roared through it the first time and that's why i probably you know when they were really yeah it i again i think the first hour was really everyone was laughing and and my wife and i were really enjoying it um-hum and then i think it was when he finally drove the car over the yard or something like that and she finally trying uh i mean it gets from from little things like throwing things at him and dropping things on him to to where she's actually yeah trying to kill him trying to kill him and then i almost got real furious and and it was like a whole mood change right here and that whole chandelier scene at the end it was like yeah i k now it oh i know it and i was so shocked at the ending i didn't think they would die yeah i really didn't i was so shocked and and and it was funny because we usually like Michael uh Douglas and and Kathleen Turner i think we've we've liked everything like uh Douglas yeah he plays i have too like Diane saw Jagged Edge you know my wife uh-huh oh yes that was good oh that was good and and i and i didn't but i guess you know she i mean she she's seen a lot more Kathleen Turner movies than i have and she the only ones i ever saw were Romancing the Stone and and and those kind of movies but she likes them and oh you didn't that's a good one uh-huh oh okay she's a good actress and uh she i was really disappointed i think we we were both disappointed in fact for some reason although it looked like it was going to b e funny oh yeah well i did i don't know maybe i got a warped sense of humor because i like i said i just roared through it the first time and then the second time when i saw it but it see it was a month later that i saw it the second time maybe if i had waited longer and seen it a second time um-hum um-hum  i'm actually at work oh i i'm in facilities and happen to have uh weekend duty here oh okay what building do you work in i'm in the South Building oh okay okay we we pull mostly evenings we are having there's three of us uh facilities managers are covering the off shifts just to have somebody here uh from management to uh see if they need anything oh okay okay oh the how many calls have you made i've only made a few um okay i'm uh getting close to twenty this is the yeah hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one but i don't really have a lot in this one usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick go ahead you first okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one okay good when the phone rings and you've got a recording and this always happens like around five or six o'clock at night it rings and you get this recording and then it won't go away and any any of the type of solicitation that where they call all the time you know oh yeah there are evenings especially Friday nights Thursday and Friday nights well we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night more people call that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall you know your sitting down to eat and the phone rings and it's like right i don't want anything thank you very much yeah i the worst one i guess is like you when it's a recording i think i don't mind so much someone calls and it's uh and it's a salesperson at least you can chat or whatever and say okay now we want to go and then when when they actually start off with a a computer and expect you to talk to a computer uh that's where i draw the line i just hang up immediately you know um-hum um-hum oh yeah uh shut my other radio off here yeah that's that's that's real irritating to me uh uh i guess they get their name i'm i'm amazed the i was i was question about that uh my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine and i have one too and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long uh-huh if they catch your answering machine they can leave their whole spiel on it yeah they they can erase all your others you know because if you have i think that's the way it is no mine i guess if it's full it will not take it i'm not sure but they can certainly uh block your answering machine so someone else calls you uh and your answering machine is full you know it won't erase um yeah that a but your right that was a good one yeah that's that's a high irritant for me drives me crazy and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them uh-huh and so it really really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not you know you have a unlisted number or not and they pass around uh cards that have everybody's name on it like if you order something through a mail order catalog uh-huh you know then you'll start getting a bunch of stuff in and a bunch of stuff and a bunch of stuff because they sell their customer list or they sell their catalog list of people to different companies yeah and everything i've got one it's not really an invasion of privacy but it's uh annoyance for me in the office with uh speaker phones you know i they're they're great for an office but this one guy next to me who's not here just so i could talk about him he uses his speaker phone all the time and it carries over and so not only would you hear it seems to me that you talk longer for one thing you kind of yell into it right right uh and so he yells into it and you hear the other person too so it's kind of a double annoyance he actually uh ruins my privacy you might say because the the TI offices are so open anyway uh-huh uh-huh uh that i'm amazed that in fact i'm i'm about ready to say something uh if he's even thought of that that's a real uncourteous thing an an invasion of everyone else's time and and concentration to just be loud i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and and annoying you know uh that's perhaps not quite an invasion of privacy but i think it is and you we both picked phone items there um-hum oh yeah oh yeah go ahead do you have any more let's see i'm trying to think oh have you heard that that i'm trying to think of what company it was there was a company that was going to uh be giving out information about your financial status oh yeah that's that's a good one too yeah i heard something about not that exactly but go ahead well um i work in the computer science center and so we hear a lot about things that are that computers are capable of doing yeah and uh this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have X amount of million peoples financial history and information on it and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera et cetera uh-huh and uh they finally uh stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused because it was such a big deal and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either i mean there was a lot of stuff going on about it uh-huh well i uh heard something similar to that i listen to i'm a uh uh a talk show person okay and other words when i when i do my chores i put the radio i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean and so i listened to was it five seventy which has continuous talk on the weekends um-hum um-hum and Neil Sperry and everybody i mean the lawyers and veterinarians and all that and uh i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial a financial application all that information on there is really not necessarily even a your social security number you know they you should just put down the basics and put N A where you don't want to answer um um-hum whether it's your personal salary or whatever uh if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down and i was curious as to what you know what specific things you you did have to put down but he says social security you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising so maybe there's something along that same line where you know in all these um-hum financial uh applications that you make out you don't have to put all that stuff down there it would be nice to know what's what was of course of course they could say well i can't give you a card and you could say fine but you know some things will be private you know but he said just put N A and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money anyway they want your card but if you don't feel like putting it down just put N A you know um-hum well that's real interesting i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need on several things yeah yeah and you know your credit application and that all all they ever need you to do is give them permission to to pull a credit thing on on yourself and there it is that's all they really care about they just want that credit history to see if you're a liable person yeah if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that i haven't i don't have any friends down at the the Austin plant but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing and we seem to up here have just breezed through that and apparently some other companies are having trouble that i don't have any trouble with it uh it's kind of unusual here we are in Dallas you know the biggest location and and it just breezed through and wasn't really no one was i guess was really too concerned about it uh yet in Austin there there were whether it was a class action or how far it got i don't really know because TI only had a few things on TI News i think about it that they were objecting to but uh some people object to that which i don't mind uh problem at all you know oh i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it and i'm former military so you get kind of used to to going through stuff like that you know you don't pay any attention to it i mean once you sign over your soul to Uncle Sam might as you know you just kind of hum yeah right right i know kind of blow it off but so i know yeah i served my time too yeah so i think i think the people who have who have been down that route or have had it to deal with anything like that have learned you know it's just one of those things you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about you know but i do know that there are several sites i didn't i wasn't aware that Austin was one of them but i think Johnson City was one yeah oh did they object too yeah there's there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue um-hum and the but also on things that i'd heard too from a stockholders meeting was that there were people uh there were the same places where they had a real bad problem with people fighting it were also places they had a big bad problem with the drug usage too yeah well i'm i'm all for it i uh it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or you know carry it to wherever you want to carry it really uh um-hum uh of course that would really be a big thing in a public school but uh i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it uh uh and i think it is they they found that it's been very low really um-hum i guess maybe at the locations though i don't know if they have it done but done it by location i don't really know if uh they need to publish that really oh i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and on an individual basis i mean if they're going to do it just deal with it and be done with it right right right but i think that was an actually actually a good thing that happened uh i never considered it i guess it's an invasion of your privacy but it's something that is for the good of so many people you know to have everyone uh take the test randomly and uh um-hum and hopefully maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that well uh i might as well get off you know if i want to stay so uh you know if that was an invasion of privacy maybe it was good um or well i think it's a safety factor too because you know when people are inebriated whether it's alcohol or drugs or whatever they are very unsafe for the their coworkers you know it's like oh sure you know my father was a fireman and i can just imagine if you know you know some guy being on drugs they go there and and you know you've got somebody that's supposed to take care of you and they fall they fall out because of the drug issue you know right um-hum i mean you can forgive somebody because all of a sudden they maybe get hurt or whatever that that you can understand but the blatant use of drugs or anything like that right will uh be a problem go ahead you got me more i this is this is a tough one i don't really haven't thought about any of this they had gardening yesterday and auto repairs and boy i could  okay where are you calling from from North Carolina i'm in California yeah that's coast to coast it's a little little bit earlier there though it sure is right it's just uh about about twelve thirty here but we're talking about a national topic anyway that's right and i think that anything we can do to improve the federal budget would be a boon to everybody no matter where they are in the country yeah that's the truth and i know that we've we've just come off a national high with the Middle East but now we're facing the same old problems that we had before and that is balancing the budget absolutely i don't know how California's budget is but North Carolina's state budget is uh disastrous right now too well so is ours we have just been told that we're thirteen billion dollars in the red which is more than the entire state budgets of about half a dozen states oh my and they're talking about uh cutting uh aid to the schools particularly the uh university systems it and i our local school district is going to have to fire all it's teacher aides to balance the budget so i things are tough all over oh California has always been a leader well i i hope in this case the rest of you will be spared oh now what was the proposition number several years ago that you voted on for oh prop thirteen is the one that uh yes limits the amount that uh real estate taxes can rise every year property taxes can only go up a certain amount per year uh until the house is sold or the person dies and then it's reevaluated right right yeah that that i think was a a smart move i don't know how it's worked out but it it seemed very logical in fact it raises one of the issues that i've thought about the national budget the budget relates to all of us and so does the tax law which usually is an offshoot of the budget process i've often thought uh-huh that Congress ought not to be allowed to pass any new tax laws say every four or five years instead of every year uh-huh an individual has no opportunity individual or corporation or any other business entity has no opportunity to plan long range well that's certainly true we can get hit uh a lot of corporations at least seem to get blindsided by taxes that are sometimes even retroactive which i would have thought was then unconstitutional but doesn't turn out to be oh yeah to the beginning of right uh that's another thing too i've often often wondered seemed to be when i was growing up i learned in Civics or Government that uh the House of Representatives has to initiate all tax bills right and i don't think it's working that way Kathleen no it's i don't know where some of these things come from but they look like they're from out in left field to me no what i don't know what we're going to do long range to solve the budgeting problem but there certainly has been proposals why are are you aware of the Grace Commission proposals from a few years back uh refresh me well the WR Grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book um-hum oh yeah okay right of his group i mean it has his name but he was just the administrator of it of places where things like government purchasing could be rationalized where uh renting of space could be made much more efficient where a lot of the accounting is just you know incredibly Byzantine and could be straightened out and where lots of different government activities are redundant oh and where and there are billions of dollars in every years budget that are just totally wasted because nobody is running the government as if it were a business that's exactly the point the business or personal budget either one i've and uh we we couldn't afford to do that sort of thing we can't we don't have money to throw around personally no and when you're not responsible and that's really what it comes down to because you know it a government uh agency really doesn't care about what the postage rate is uh-hum it has no incentive to hold back on expenses uh i happened many years ago to work for a state government for a while and it absolutely boggled my mind the way they budgeted because there was no uh an attempt to figure out what it really should cost to do what we should be doing uh-huh it was just take last year's budget add X percentage ask for that and if you hadn't spent all your money by December run out and buy something quick so that you buy something that's right because you you are afraid your allocation will be cut the next year and that's right i can remember uh the entire office got new electric typewriters because we hadn't spent all our budget money in December that was just crazy um-hum and the mentality was and probably rightfully so because the people devising the budget uh didn't go back to a zero based budgeting they just did it on the basis of what they spend five percent increase and uh go on with it that's right we might come up short next year if we haven't spent everything this year and so no matter how foolish the expenditure be sure we get rid of that money uh-huh uh-huh and you know grace uh type waste that you mentioned we see often highlighted in the military and the defense department but it's uh i'm sure it's widespread to every agency absolutely i think uh probably if you just looked at congressional budgets the amount they waste on frivolous things uh with congressional office staff is again mind boggling you read about what it costs the new uh house whip or uh the uh Speaker of the House to redecorate and my God those offices were just redecorated a few years ago um-hum oh yes they it they spent hundreds of thousands of dollars they're spending twenty five thousand dollars just this year for a feasibility study to determine whether they should build a second gym at the capitol for the staffs of the Congress i'm surprised it's that low Kathleen well that's that's not to build one stick that's just oh i know i'm surprised the feasibility study could be done for that well it that's the kind of thing that makes me mad i want to vote the whole batch of them out of office if that's the way they think they should spend our money and just because it's a few hundred thousand here oh yes who was it said a a billion here a billion there pretty soon we're talking about real money yeah that's sad i think that was old Everett Dirtyson or somebody that's sad and people don't realize it we've become sort of blase about the uh amount of money because a billion if if the government paid a dollar a second back in the national debt just a dollar a second it would take thirty years to repay a billion dollars now you know that's that's a long time and that's a lot of money yes it is and when we're talking about trillions and when we're talking about adding that mu ch to a budget where it's just already in the hole just the think about the amount of interest we'll be paying on that we'll probably more than double it um have you the uh banking crisis is another another case i was reading this week about the FDIC saying that they couldn't take on another large bank failure without going to government to Congress um and borrowing and i started thinking now wait a minute they're in exactly the same shape uh that they criticized the banks that they're dealing with exactly the same shape but that's right yeah the only difference is the the uh taxpayers that's right FDIC can't go broke yeah because you and i will pay for it uh-huh or our children and grandchildren right right have we solved anything Kathleen i doubt it but then i doubt if we ever will just keep writing to your congressman and telling him that i i moved here from Oklahoma i'm originally from Virginia and moved to Oklahoma for twenty years and just moved back to the southeast and Oklahoma just passed uh last year a law stating that uh or limiting the terms of the state representatives yeah we did that this year too California just passed that in the last election yeah it will be interesting to see if we have any any impetus to go on to the national i hope it will yeah i think so too i i get torn thinking about some of the good people all the people i think are good and having to lose them but on the other hand uh maybe they'll pay more serious attention to the process while they're there instead of the reelection i'm well the thing is yeah what's funny is that everybody says they want to throw out the rascals but nobody wants to throw out his own rascal otherwise we wouldn't have ninety eight percent of the incumbents reelected nobody does that's right nobody does all right right are you working yes i'm an editor at a think tank editor good oh i i would uh love to get into another conversation with you about that well it's a fascinating job i get to see all kinds of interesting ideas and i do my small bit to help in uh at least express themselves coherently even if i don't always agree with what they're expressing oh i i can imagine that that whole process is fascinating to me i think i'd like to observe if not participate sometime well we've got some really really interesting people we get fifty different fellows every year from all around the world um-hum and uh so we get just the year of intense interaction with these people and sometimes we really hate to see them go we'd like to keep them for years and years and lots of times we're not so  i was i might have had it sitting there somewhere no i well can you hold up let me i've got a portable phone here let me just turn it on real quick i can go over to where i think i might have it okay okay okay let's see here i just it's it's it's supposed to be on the instruction sheet but yeah oh yeah here we go i didn't see one on mine let's see just a second oh it doesn't hm um gee if i was at work i could give you a number i tell you what yeah call this number in the in uh uh during the day nine nine five zero three two seven okay zero three two seven okay and and uh person who answers there'll be able to help you okay my wife happens to be a secretary in the in in the group that does this oh okay okay that'll work okay let me hit one now okay okay uh in my community they are doing a lot as as as far as recycling goes uh Waco's a pretty small city and so a lot of the city people i guess they want they take they take care of the community more than i would think that a big city does or they can because they're smaller and so they're doing all kinds of recycling projects and the school kids are doing all kinds of things and i'm a i'm a news reporter and so i yeah yeah report on a lot of the recycling things that they do and just last week they opened up a new recycling center uh so now they have two uh in an adjoining community uh Hewett uh-huh they are doing uh curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities it's very expensive oh yeah yeah Plano just uh just started a program where they uh they gave everybody these big plastic garbage cans so uh-huh and uh what they're doing is on Thursday they pick up the regular garbage and these plastic garbage cans but on Mondays uh if you leave they have these special huge paper bags right um-hum right and if you put your clippings in that they'll pick that up on Mondays and um-hum yeah that's a form of the curbside yeah yeah right and then as i understand it they're uh they're planning to um start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in to to recycle that as well so um um-hum i know even uh Wal-Mart Department Store i don't if they do it there they have the recycling bin right outside the store right oh wow and it's got glass aluminum plastic and yeah i know all the the grocery stores here have a a bins when you walk in if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags uh-huh right the plastic bags so uh i think it's great uh um i know the kids uh at school are being indoctrinated into the whole idea i know my daughter came home the other night um-hum uh-huh yeah and um she was all excited because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your local recycling center was and she called it and turns out the the nearest one's in Garland which is about i don't know forty five minutes to an hour from here but wow do you recycle yourself at home do you yeah we um in fact i've got a car full of newspapers that we're trying to um-hum uh-huh the uh here's a sort of i guess a a setback uh there were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here and we went to all of them yesterday and none of them had bins for for the papers so um-hum hm i don't know if they just discontinued it or it's kind of rough doing the newspaper i understand because the they can't recycle the uh i guess it's the sale papers that have the color on them oh yeah and so it's kind of hard for them to i guess uh separate all that yeah i know we don't sort that out um um-hum yeah i don't think anybody would you know i don't think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult yeah and oh yeah i don't recycle myself i live i'm single and so i guess if i had a family i'd probably be more aware than now that i am single but uh yeah right right i i you probably uh eat uh fast food type stuff and uh on the go yeah yeah especially on my job i'm hardly ever home so you know my yeah well when i was single i was a reporter too i so i uh i can identify with you um uh i know that a lot of times that you're working double shifts and odd hours and uh-huh yeah yeah um-hum yeah you just eat when you have something to eat you just go in and you don't know when you're coming out right so but uh let's see what else are they doing so uh jeez i'm all out of recycling i know uh the Boy Scouts collect newspapers here and uh and uh in in fact the there's a the kids at the end of the block come by every once in a while when they want extra money um-hum uh-huh they they come by uh collecting aluminum cans because we have places that you can go where you can the city the city has places where you can just dump the aluminum cans but uh hm right my mother before all this recycling stuff started i guess well not before it all started but she would collect the cans and you go like in front of the supermarkets or whatever and you put the cans in this bin thing and it spits out money yeah that's yeah yeah yeah well that's where that's where these kids take their aluminum cans yeah yeah that that freaked me out when we first did that i thought okay yeah you you don't get rich on those right right huh we got like eight cents or something yeah exactly uh so at work we do recycle we have a little recycling bin for our cans and bottles and uh those go out yeah the where where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans uh-huh hm uh one is for your normal crap trash and one is just for paper and they uh they had a big campaign for it and there's a list of things that you're allowed to put in the paper bin uh-huh um-hum and uh you know and but they they're pretty good about it it doesn't you know you can have the staples in them and the paper clips on them and the plastic windows wow they take care of all of that but they don't want certain types of paper uh they don't want anything you know they don't want you know like transparencies overheads you know they don't want any of that in there wow right uh-huh just regular paper and right they don't want the garbage from your from your lunch in there um and uh and there's uh even little um uh this uh board hm right um-hum outside the cafeteria that that shows uh has a it's a picture of a tree with a with a squirrel going up and it's like a a a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees you've saved um-hum oh and it shows you how many thousands of trees uh have been saved because of the recycling program at work so like so that gives you kind of an incentive right right well that's great if you know that like a lot of things you pick up today almost everything says recyclable or this is made from recyclables or something it's it's amazing it really is it's amazing to me how fast i i'm sure recycling's been going on forever and it's just right right right yeah yeah i guess everyone is picking it up now you know but it's just amazing to me how much it's come in the last year since last Earth Day you know everything's i mean recycle recycle everywhere you go right oh yeah right well i know when i was a kid uh which was quite a while ago um we used to collect newspapers and take them to the there was a uh i don't know what it was a plant that it was a paper plant i guess it was that was fairly close to where i lived in Richmond Virginia and um um-hum um-hum um-hum you could you bring your papers in to sell them there i remember doing that when i was a kid and uh hm i remember my mother used to take the Coke bottles in and you get like ten ten cents or something like that oh yeah sure yeah right that's right yeah i guess that was a form of but now it's just like perpetrated into the crowd into the you know society it's like if you don't recycle you feel you feel almost uh right i don't know like you're doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost so hm that's right yeah well that's good i mean we're such a we're such a um throwaway society yeah wasteful um-hum um-hum it's uh it's nice because you know uh if you talk to people who grew up during the depression uh-huh nothing was wasted i mean everything and nowadays it's like you know nobody darns their socks i mean if you see a hole in it you throw it away by a new pair of socks you know kind of thing and uh i yeah yeah throw it away that's it yeah we're spoiled very spoiled yeah i you know i guess i believe the propaganda if you want to call it that that uh um you know we're uh we're we we have limited resources and uh we really should think about uh conserving them instead of wasting them right i know i'm doing the story big story i'm covering now is of about our landfill here uh-huh and uh what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away wow everywhere everywhere America could be recycled yeah wow like twenty four million to and i think that accounts for uh i think one quarter or half of the landfill space wow so i mean i just learn all these little yeah uh propaganda things you can't always i mean it'd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it isn't it all it it isn't always i know sometimes it is oh yeah yeah not at all i know there's place called Mount Trashmore Trashmore which is a a park that they built on top of a landfill hm um-hum hm and i can't remember where it is i think it's in Washington DC or thereabouts Mount Trashmore i haven't heard of that one yeah but uh yeah that's like the big stink around here this landfill thing they're wanting to expand it and a lot of the community the people that live around the area don't want it expanded because you know they say it'll uh yeah uh poison their water and you know poison the air and there's an elementary school right across the street and all kinds of stuff so it's a pretty pretty big issue yeah well yeah i i guess uh you know the scary the the scary part is that you don't know what the effects are you know fifty years from now um-hum exactly you know it's easy to say well we'll build a concrete hole and and nothing'll happen and then they'll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so um-hum um-hum right right that's what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now but they're looking in the long run you know and they're saying well forty years from now we'll right right and there's and there's no way to measure that i mean you you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc you've created yeah um-hum hm yeah people don't want to wait uh by the no nope  okay do you have any um ideas on universal health insurance do you have any strong opinions you do yeah i think it's probably a good idea um i think given that um well given that there're so many people who don't have health insurance it's probably a real smart thing that at least have some basic coverage for everyone i mean you hear these horror stories of people uh-hum homeless people going to the hospital and and being thrown out because they have no insurance and having to go to someplace else you know it would be nice if yeah right no matter where you are or who you are or what happened you know what happened to you you go to the hospital and they say okay just just take him don't worry about who or what he is later so yeah yeah yeah i feel like there should be some kind coverage made but i i am really leery of um that would be a nice thing kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be six times more expensive as what yeah no that that is certainly true but i wonder about like in Canada in Canada where everybody everybody um automatically has insurance in Canada yeah uh-huh right and they have that in England too but i think it is a pretty poor they get a lot lower quality care than we do now i know that some people don't agree with me but um i know you have to wait real long time to get for certain surgeries that aren't emergencies and you do have the kind of choices that we have here yeah and um i've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals and i really don't want to give up having those choices that's true that's something i haven't thought about because i think i mean there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors and good hospitals and bad doctors hospitals and that's true that's true and in England at least at the time i was familiar with it about ten years ago they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be no oh so you don't get any choices at all or anything no no i mean that yeah oh that's a problem yeah because i i mean i know i even even among you know even even now the way we have it now there's it's getting worse isn't it yeah there are some places yeah i mean like we have an an HMO that allows us to pick our own physicians right right uh-huh and we picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him you know and and had to switch because i felt he was a quack right that's exactly the problem there's just so many such variation in it but you see i guess what what they had in England and i guess in Canada is socialized medicine so maybe that's like the extreme of it do you think yeah yeah that is the extreme and what what that i what that i think tends to do though is i think that tends to that probably has two a a good and a bad side for young people wanting to become doctors i mean what you get is other people who are motivated to be because the money isn't i guess as much for doctors anymore so they would wind up getting uh-hum uh-hum right right the people who really want to be doctors being doctors but then again you know you don't get those people who'd be good and are real smart and decided hey i i wanna make a lot of money so i will go into medicine you know you don't get those really want to right right or that yeah exactly or people also get the feeling that well geez you know you do have to worry about you have a lot of job security there and it's more of a seniority i would imagine kind of thing instead of having a skill or whatever to advance and so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of yeah that's true i don't know i think we have to have something i really do yeah and it would be nice to see something where at least right i mean even something that said you know look free major medical to all you know to everyone and then beyond that you sort of work out on your own if you want yeah yeah i know i i don't know i i've having worked in doctor's offices and stuff i see it from a physician's point of view and i uh-huh i think the problem with the skyrocketing costs right now is the insurance companies because i don't see doctors getting all rich oh yeah and i think hospitals do make money but not nearly as much as insurance companies do i think they are really making a killing and nobody's talking about it nobody's oh right no yeah they're the ones who make i mean they're the ones they have you know decide although i mean the unfortunate part of that is that is that people tend to forget that doctors are humans as well uh-hum so that so that you know insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people or certain physician types of of doctors given that you know someone decides to have a malpractice suit against them well they could take you know it could be millions i mean unfortunately and and if the doctor whether it was you know i mean i feel those cases where the doctor was wrong or malicious or something you know but there are you know i mean right right right there are mistakes are made right sure sure yep mistakes you know everybody makes mistakes unfortunately and and it shouldn't be a billion dollar you know industry it should be i made a mistake and this is this is fair compensation not so is i guess yeah i think that's the legal part it coming in to too that i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for yeah that is a big problem that'd be nice or or i don't know because then that's where the insurance company benefits if if people weren't having to spend these huge amounts of money on getting insurance coverage uh-huh it would be a lot better yeah and i'm sort of in a in a government run medicine program sort of i'm i'm in a well well i'm a graduate student at and uh you know yeah are you okay at where oh okay uh-huh are what i'm in Texas yep yep yep at University of Rochester in Rochester New York i'll bet you're in Texas up yeah i was gonna bet that okay um yeah and as as it turns out my wife has pretty decent coverage through her company and can get me covered as well uh-huh oh great yeah but uh which is great except and because the university but the university offers two plans they offer what they call the mandatory portion which is basically major medical and then they offer the waiveable portion uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh which is which is you know every you know sort of everything else you need so your your your your basic care beyond major medical separate stuff uh-huh okay and they don't and even though my my wife's insurance covers me for everything i still have to pay them a hundred some odd dollars a semester for the mandatory portion of the insurance yeah uh-huh oh no that that that can't be legal yeah i'm not actually sure it is or not but no one people keep sort of fighting it and i'm and i keep meaning to fight it but you know i just don't want to spend my time oh my gosh how can they how how can they make you pay for insurance coverage well the reason the i mean their rational is is they make everyone pay for it so that it it keeps the cost of university health services down and everyone can use it you know it how how does it keep the cost down because everyone is now forced to pay for this oh so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy and there's like a uh well no what yeah well what they used it no they what they use it for is is is university health services we have a we have a hospital here and a subportion a subportion of the hospital was okay okay okay so you're subsidizing the hospital right so i'm basically paying for a welfare state now as it turns out as it turns out um my wife and i have chosen to use the university as health services as out primary care physician we can do that uh-huh okay oh good so in in but in effect i am pay twice for one service you are you are i know and see that's the thing that is the thing now that i'm in my thirties now and i have three kids and i'm i mean i'm very liberal i'm extremely liberal and um and i say but now in the last couple years i have gotten to the point where i am saying i just can not afford to pay any more uh-hum to help people out i i wanna keep helping people out but i need the federal for the government or the agencies to find a way to do it on the amount of money you know that i can afford i just can't afford any more it's it's out it's just outrageously yeah yeah it's just starting to get me angry and for the first time in my life i'm starting to feel like i well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that i'm paying for now you know yeah well that's that's certain true i mean i can't afford to have some kind of some kind of voluntary optional operation for myself because our our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over say the past five years to the point now where even if we need surgery our insurance only covers eighty percent of it right which is ridiculous and right and so no matter what happens to me if i get in to a car accident this afternoon i have no idea you know no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical cost because my insurance is now only eighty percent of what ever it's going to be yeah and um so on top of that um then what if i what if we decide to have universal health insurance so i am subsidizing everybody else and and what if they are lucky enough to get into a doctor and a program that's going to say okay well you really need to have those varicose veins or fixed or your teeth fixed or something like that and i'm paying for it right you know it stuff like that has happened with education and other things that you hear about and it's just wait a minute you know my kids aren't getting that how come their kids kids are getting exactly i don't i don't uh and and i know that it's only in a few cases and i don't want them to to uh cut funding for welfare programs or anything i don't want them to do that because i know a lot of people they live right on the edge and they need that uh-huh yeah it's it's one of the strange i i think it's strange as you get older i i i think the tendency is that as people get older but but i uh-hum uh-huh and gain i don't i don't i don't want to say more responsibilities but you know things like homes and kids and so forth they tend to lose that liberalism they had when they were younger uh-hum right well yeah that's and it's uh it's funny because a couple years ago i hear a quote from Winston Churchill let's see if i can remember it anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart and a person who's not a conservative in his fifties has no brain that is probably very true it was something like that yeah and uh i don't know i guess that's what's happening to me but i i i think it's just starting um its i i don't know maybe other people i do you think it's a sign of the times that people are starting to say alright really we really mean it no more taxes or maybe is it my own personal no i i think think people are starting to really mean it i mean everywhere you look you're getting something new i mean you start off you know especially um you guys i believe in Texas you don't have state tax do you yeah no no income tax right we have we have federal income tax state income tax local income tax we have state tax on gasoline um you know because our our so on top of the federal tax on gasoline we have state tax on gasoline so we're just yeah oh oh wow yep yeah but i tell you um we have incredible property taxes down here or that could be yeah making up for the difference so yeah and we don't have the services that other states  i'll let you go first oh well what's there to say doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody yeah it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty yeah yeah i know what you mean um i in Maryland they they do have capital punishment and uh i've seen uh a lot of people get convicted sentenced and then just nothing happens just endless endless endless appeals yeah uh-huh well from what i understand i saw a statistic just a few days ago um so far this year year or was it during the last year somewhere during a years time i think it was they executed twenty five people in the nation meanwhile there were twenty five hundred people on death row so i i and it's building up you know they're they're convicting them faster than they're executing them so it's really building up yeah what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years and uh here in Maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons uh-huh yeah everybody's got that uh just yeah but i mean in here it's uh to the point where they were letting prisoners go uh-huh uh commuting the sentences of those that were in in jail for lesser crimes yeah in order to put more people in into the jails and it was just uh amazing uh-huh to me and of course they made a big deal out of the the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out yeah and being rearrested and isn't isn't Maryland where the famous Willy Horton case was uh i can't remember refresh my memory it was uh that was the one that was used so much in the campaign in the political in the presidential race uh may it may not have been Maryland it may have been Massachusetts i don't remember um i don't remember myself anyway well the question is you know do you think it it does make a difference in whether or not a criminal commits a crime or do you think it can if it's done right um i think if they if they started executing them on a regular basis uh that i think it might make a difference right now i don't see it making a difference i don't see someone not going out there if it and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death i mean most people out there committing murders like don't care uh-huh they just don't care yeah well i think in large measure the reason they don't care it's not because the punishment but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished yeah the police don't catch them or the courts don't convict them or or they don't serve very much of the time and so uh you know their their success rate is very high crime does pay cash you can make a good living at it yeah yeah and there's uh there's a lot of people here in Baltimore that uh have and we just had uh a real big cocaine bust and of course you know they're they're playing it up real big that it was looked like it was a very very small ring and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy yeah but i mean uh Baltimore has uh an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year last year it was DC i guess Baltimore caught them well it's kind of it's kind of moved up and you have to remember that it it it uh there's i think X number of people out there that are going to commit murders uh-huh and uh once you kill off a few of them i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder yeah yeah the only consolation is so many of the murders are you know the the violent people going against each other and so they you know society's not going to put them to death well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to uh i think i think capital punishment is an appropriate punishment for the kind of people where we say you know this sort of person is just not acceptable to our society and we are there by going to remove them from society not temporarily but permanently yeah i mean i i personally think life imprisonment i don't think much of life of life imprisonment first of all it's never turns out to be life but second you know why should we the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again well then why bother just execute them because that's that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again yeah so any any anybody that says life in prison with no chance of parole i'd say uh give them the death penalty so yeah you know it makes sense um you know you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused but i mean uh so few and far between uh you know makes good TV movies and that's about it yeah and and also um the the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell yeah and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are and and that way we can be sure you know we can find out the truth we can find out what really happened yeah and and base the verdict sentence on what the person did not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear yeah i had my uh my father-in-law participated in a uh a jury trial he was he was actually on the jury and uh this man was accused of killing uh i think it was two people uh and shooting a uh policeman um point blank in the face of course he didn't die and uh this was during a holdup of a uh uh a restaurant and it came out during the trial that um they had tried to rob another place uh-huh uh-huh and uh when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money it turned out to be a couple cookies and uh you know jumbo cookies and and so they were so upset from robbing this guy you know trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started you know shooting people just started shooting people you know it's because they botched the first job and yeah so now they're going to get even yeah and get even with who i mean you know stupid guys yeah and uh it turned out that the you know policeman survived to the point that he was able to you know identify the guy uh-huh and of course you know they tried to make the cop look out like he was uh a uh no good rotten drunk yeah i mean it was amazing so what was the verdict what was the results there oh he was found guilty yeah he uh oh last i heard he uh he beat a push for the death penalty now whether they finally got it or not i don't know i kind of uh uh-huh stopped listening after a while uh-huh um you know he would come home and and you know after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on and of course then they had to go back to decide you know after the the penalty phase yeah they've decide the penalty separately from the verdict he had to go right and uh yeah everybody everybody was pretty much you know let's burn him uh-huh and that's you know that's the way they wanted to do it and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he uh you know some people on the case were were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges but i mean when it all came down they just within an hour decided the man's fate yeah well you know you just have to decide you know what you well there's really two separate decisions there i guess one is did it really happen the way the the prosecutor said it happened you know is this man really guilty and you have to decide that but then you have to decide you know as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing yeah and that will i i've never been on a jury i've never had that experience i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life yeah yeah well it it it went pretty pretty quick from what he said uh-huh but i mean there's there's there's a lot of other crimes out there i mean besides murder i think uh now if you're dealing drugs now caught more than twice or something yeah uh it there's uh a death penalty associated with it well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence i mean yeah i can handle people people selling drugs you know it's it's wrong but it it's not worth somebody getting executed for but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because somebody you know these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing uh-huh and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life that you know you never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not yeah yeah i agree and so i go let's these are the kind of people i would like to yeah get out of here and get out of circulation and say i don't we don't accept your kind in our society yeah i agree i i've i have uh a low tolerance for that kind of uh that kind of person and uh as far as uh you know there are some some other crimes that i think uh you know kidnapping um you know when they i mean kidnapping per se has a certain uh fine and penalty associated with it but uh-huh um some of these people are just out and out brutal i some of the cases i've heard about over the years  all right well how do you use credit cards Carol scarily very very very seldom yeah only in dire emergencies in fact i leave them home uh-huh is that from past experience bad experiences in the past or or just uh the fact that you don't want to be tempted i have never uh i've used them but never to the extent of getting in debt like uh some people do uh-huh it's just that since my money is tight right now i don't even give myself a tempting uh-huh because i've gotten them all paid off yeah so now i just wait okay before i use it but um like i'll keep one minor one like Sears in my purse just for identification purposes uh-huh because i won't use it period but like if you'd take a trip or something if i'll use bank uh Visa yeah yeah do you but otherwise huh-uh do you order a lot of things over the phone or credit card orders never never never huh so uh like if you go to uh K Wal-Mart or something you always pay in cash or with a check um-hum cash check cash okay very seldom do i even use cash um so your money funnels directly into your checking account huh um-hum okay how about you me i have a Discover card and i use that when when gas prices are the same whether you use cash or credit i usually use my Discover card and i can let my money sit in the bank for an extra because they pay in our credit union pays at the end of the month on your balance so i will let it sit and then draw interest from that and then i'll pay my credit cards off in full every month so you know i have no finance charges as long as i pay off exactly on time which i do and also Discover card gives you a little bit of money back it's not much but you know five or six bucks uh instead of writing a check for a large purchase if i'm disciplined enough i can uh like well uh like buying a suit if i spend like three hundred bucks you know i'll get some of that back through the cash back program and also at the end of the month you know i'll get my interest on that three hundred bucks that was sitting in my checking account that would be gone had i written a check and i do that sometimes but like when we go to the like uh i'd say it's about fifty fifty writing a check or using the Discover card it just i don't know for some reason it just depend if it's something small i don't want to write a uh use my credit card but that's the only one i have and and sometimes we order things through the mail like books and uh which is i just if they have a toll free number i'll call it up and you know charge it to my credit card as as long as you know i'd make myself pay on time every time so there's no finance charge and it's really you know like you said some people go off half wild and spend uh they think because they've got a thousand dollar limit then you know they've got to get that limit every month or something and uh they end up paying finance charges and they just and then they'll pay the minimum balance every month and then end up they may have got something on sale but all the interest you know they end up paying more than what they would have had they just paid cash for it see that's exactly i didn't get in debt but what i did was one year oh i can't remember when five six must be eight nine years ago when i paid my taxes i realized that i had ran up so much on my credit card that i was paying interest that was ridiculous i mean sure it was the tax write-off but uh-huh there was no sense to it yeah i mean there was no sense at all to it i was paying more interest on that card than the card was worth as far as i could tell yeah so at that point there we just stepped right on you know just saving all the way in and i'll turn around like on my car i'll borrow against my insurance which i pay five percent interest and buy my car that way huh and that works wow so i don't have to worry about it but i use uh override at uh Texin Credit Union so that i don't have to keep too much i keep enough balance in my checking account so i don't have to pay you know a service charge what you override and then i yeah what's that mean if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account oh okay so i don't have to you know worry about it one way of the other and i just keep that minimum balance in there okay i see so it just you know and i pretty much budget that way all the way around but as i said my money's tight yeah is that a free service that override right now yeah huh there's no charge for it huh so i do it that way but i do as i said i keep the credit card in my purse for identification yeah when somebody wants identification one way or the other it's but usually i won't put anything on that card unless it's something i really unbelievably need otherwise i better have it somewhere else right because i'm like you i'm not going to have a balance on that thing because it's too easy i know too many people that pay off that card well i've got this credit card well maybe i'd better use that one or something like that and i'm saying huh-uh not me yeah it's just it's just so easy when uh okay i think a lot of it's psychological you hand a piece of plastic and all you do is sign your name at least either with cash or with a check you have to write out the amount so you actually see how much you're spending well it's like um the little piece of plastic for uh to get your money out or the credit union all you have to do is put it in the machine one way or the other uh-huh and like i'll run down there like you know for vacation and things like that and i'll leave it in there in savings account till the last day yeah and then i'll put the card in and pull it out what i want but i'll pull it out of savings because i don't keep any balance in the checking uh-huh but that's still that's easy enough as it is but i wouldn't use the machine to pay fifty cents or a dollar for it oh yeah no kidding i won't even go that far i complain every time i i mean we've only had to do it twice since my wife and i've been married in nine months is use the machine that charges and it charges a buck and one time it was because the machine at TI was broken and we had to have cash so we had no choice but to go to the other place and the other one wa s just this weekend when we just we were leaving out of town and we had to you know just have some cash and so we used the automatic teller card but you know i'm very chintzy with my money i don't like to spend lose a dollar just because i use a machine or something it's um senseless but i'm like you if there's something really that i wanted i'll write to them before i'll put the credit card call in though i won't put it on the card unless i really i'll take write them letter uh check for it yeah that's because it wastes too much time on the credit card and i'm kind of i'm leery about things going on my card because i've had you know had to go back and return something and it took so long to get it off and that was years ago yeah so i'm having real good luck with a credit card i mean it came off there's no problem but it just takes too much scares me yeah and like Tom Thumb's got uh credit card now they used for groceries really yeah over here in in Plano their own Tom Thumb card uh-huh and you can charge your groceries on it that's funny and uh you can either charge your groceries on it you have a choice or you can write a check and they okayed it that way uh-huh so you don't have to keep going and get it you know credit check and things like that and they'll give you an extra twenty five dollars no charge or anything else like that but i won't even put that on the groceries huh because hey what happens if the clerk marks in an extra number or something like that and i don't check it yeah yeah no thank you i don't want anything going on my card you know in my checking account unless it's i know about it right but do you like Discover card i hadn't heard too much about it yeah it seems a lot more places are taking it now which when i first got it it was a problem with it i i said i don't want to use the credit card and i just carried it with me like you said for identification and sometimes when i would take it go on a trip you know it it was good to have a credit card because like if my car breaks down or something a lot of states don't because i travel from Indiana to Texas and a lot of states won't take out of state checks like you know just some gas station out of the way um-hum they want cash or a major card so i went ahead and got that and there's no fee no service fee for it plus they play pay you cash back at the end of the i think i earned probably eight or nine bucks last year which isn't very much but i'd just started to use it and and like i i had some major purchases i just was dumb and forgot to put on there like uh i wrote a check for my wife's wedding ring which was a lot of money and if i would have put it on the Discover card the money you know could have sat in the savings account or the checking account for an extra month and it also would have paid me probably you know eight or nine bucks back on uh the end of the year thing so i messed that up so i you know i'm still not in it's not a good habit to use it but fortunately i'm not uh like some people not a spendthrift and i really have to think about my purchases and i know if i have money in the checking account to cover it then i i'll use the Discover card you know to get a little more interest but uh yeah i i'm just very  do you exercise a lot um it's uh scaled back considerably uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball league and occasional ride on the bike but uh i uh i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat is mowing the lawn a new exercise yeah lawn it's a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it all kinds of stuff flower beds oh my i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not yeah that that's true that's true it's there's always something to do and uh and and uh it keeps me going well you're you are so far ahead of me i used to uh but i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it uh-huh yeah because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes yeah and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but it's a lot you know it's not too strenuous right and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i don't know what i did to my knee i was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer uh-huh and i mashed it wrong or i did something oh gosh and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk wow and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee i don't want anyone to think about that uh-huh no that that's a tough situation ever that's that microscopic stuff you know uh-huh not my kneecap uh-huh so i'm i'm being very good yeah but i miss it i really do and i oh that it's so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that my wife uh runs or likes to run but uh she's well we moved we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area oh really yeah and she started running down there and all the hills uh-huh and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldn't take it anymore she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and uh ever since that it's just been real difficult it's real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground so she's kind of in the same mode She was all ready to get back into it and start running uh five K's and ten K's and stuff this spring and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape and when you want to do it it's really really aggravating you know it it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and it's another thing to to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health i can you understand that uh yeah uh i don't really want to i just know i need to well it's you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i don't love it uh-huh uh-huh you know but i will do it sure uh it's not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk i have got to be so much more careful with what i do yeah yeah uh-huh it is and you know you you it's depressing you don't well speaking for myself i don't sleep as well when i am not exercising and uh it's really it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i i don't particularly enjoy well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didn't physically i mean i just my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode and if i if i skipped it then it kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack right right boy yeah hopefully my my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it yeah that's for sure i have ask you a question off the subject though you're in you're living in the Castle Park area okay that's right i grew up in Oak Cliff did you really yes uh just close to Methodist Hospital okay yeah on Candy C A N D Y right oh in fact i lived there oh until nineteen late nineteen fifties okay okay and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them yeah it is um we're on we're on a little street called Bison Trail it's only about a block and a half long but it's it's over on the other end It it's over by the far edge of uh Stephen's Park Golf Course oh i know exactly where that is yeah it's it's uh you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there yeah sure and yeah um our street is uh an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our you know one little block and a half there four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their late twenties to mid thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited oh that's that's wonderful that is a gorgeous gorgeous place yeah and then oh it's it's a lot of fun the people are great there too our uh we've got a real active neighborhood association and uh we have well we've got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and you know all that kind of stuff so it's a lot of fun and it is it's a really beautiful area and some some of the people um some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and they're they're getting them at a real bargain well sure they are you know they're they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars good great and uh and they're just going to town with them they're people are putting in pools and and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look oh wow and uh it it's it 's really coming around i guess i need to go over there and just drive around and look it's it's worth the trip oh i'm sure it must be i'm just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story uh-huh well story and a half really because we had a basement okay and the guy that built it was weird i mean weird yeah it's one of these really creative houses that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else okay oh wow and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone everyone had houses like that They were all completely different yeah uh-huh that's right and so neat yeah ours ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess it's twenty eight by fifteen front porch and uh next door we've got an Austin stone uh across the street the guy just uh it was burnt out about two years ago and and the guy moved in and completely redid it and it's got oh it's got a rounded front on it it's all brick and he's he's landscaped his yard and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that so yeah there's a variety you just don't see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot now why couldn't your wife run around the golf course is that not good um oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness center at Methodist oh was he and they have a quarter mile track there so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off the problem is she's a school teacher and for her she can't run in the morning For her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night in the winter time it's starting to get dark and oh you know you don't want to she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas regardless whether it's north Dallas or whatnot and when she goes over to this fitness center it's fenced in and there's somebody in the building watching her and all that so there's a lot of consideration yes i i really hear that you know i think you know you're in Oak Cliff uh-huh but i'm in Plano In west Plano yeah and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere uh-huh right if you are on the street you better belong there that's right because it's not a through street that's right and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business and my husband uh-huh had a lot of heartburn with that yeah i mean it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on right when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty but huh-uh he didn't think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so yeah yeah it's not just because you are in Oak Cliff it's just because you're smart that you don't do things like that that's right that's right it only takes one time that is it's a hard lesson to learn so that's right there's only one crazy out there you know to make any difference uh-huh yeah yeah it's you know it goes all over well we got this  okay Michelle um could you give me a few ideas on what you think is wrong with our public school system um i don't think that the parents back the teachers enough any more like with discipline and and such and i think that the um because of that the teachers are starting to lose oh i don't know lose interest like you know before like they would really try and help you i think and i can see the difference from when i was in high school and my little brothers and sisters are in it now where the teachers like they can't discipline you whenever you are you know so they just don't even care any more yeah i'm not sure if that's if that's a condition of of the lack of interest of the parents or if that's a condition of the administrators in the school systems um i've got a brother-in-law that was was teaching in Connecticut down by the Navy base and they have a a a um-hum fairly a transient population you know they're um only stationed there for a short period of time so most of the kids never get to finish high school uh there one or two years and then they have to be they're shipped off some place else and he teaches uh he teaches English and he teaches uh shop um-hum and it got to a point where he said that the administrators were coming to him just about every year having him downgrade his English exams because too many students were failing them oh that's not good yeah so in that particular school system um that was that was one of the problems and i guess one of the reasons the administrators uh were were putting so much pressure on him was uh the parents were going to them saying you know my Johnny or my Mary is smarter than that and blah blah blah and they can't fail and so oh you know and that's really bad because that's really hurting them in the long run because up here at college now um we are so far behind the foreign students that's right they are so far more advanced than we are and a lot of them even know their English grammar better than i do and they can't speak it as well but i mean to write it is probably better than the way i write it um yeah because they uh they care it's something that they want to learn um um-hum i'm sure you're you're more uh fluent in other things the things that you're interested in than some other people too uh i've been out of school for a long time so you know when i went to school i it was in a rural area and they had like two grades in the same class so when you're i think it was uh first and second third and fourth were in the same classroom so when you went through the first grade and you graduated you went to the second grade you just moved to the second half of the class on the other side of the room i found looking back at it now that um-hum yeah when i was in the second grade i knew just about everything that was there i had learned it from the first grade and the same thing with the fourth i had learned it so it's the amount of teaching you get i think uh um you're like a sponge when you're young you absorb just about everything that they can throw at you um-hum um today well you're you're closer to it now than i am um did you go to high school in Pennsylvania yes i did okay so that's you're you're native then to Pennsylvania so how was your high school did they have with the split out like some people were going to college so they took certain courses and some people were shop uh-huh okay yeah we had um college advanced courses and if you were going to college you could take them or if you didn't want to go to college you didn't have to take them but they were optional you know they were there if anyone wanted to take them just because you were going if you if you wanted to take them and you weren't going to college you still could they didn't limit it to just the people who wanted to college could take them um our math i think we were very strong in our math we were taking tests and our math okay okay was um placing like third and fourth in like the nation where you had to send them in oh that was good yeah and our and our you know for our level and stuff like that you know they had the placing we're placing third or fourth but our English i feel was way below i don't know if i'm just more math oriented but like even on my SAT's i scored two hundred more points on my math than i did in my English and to have that big of a spread is unreal yeah yeah um and we were just the opposite up here um i took the same algebra class two years in a row same book same teacher and that's only because of our school system but as far as English um um-hum we had a professor that taught English which was very unusual for our school system so our English was probably better than than most of the other school systems in in the state um-hum um up here now we're finding that more and more parents of are pulling their children out of the school systems and they are tutoring them at home really yeah i work with uh a couple of the people that i work with you know share the same office are doing that they've pulled their children out and they get a much rounder education um and why that is i don't know i think it's too much administration at the top um-hum also i don't know the level of the teachers today are they dedicated like they used to be years ago or is it just a it's just a job so they can get the summers off i don't think they are um-hum how about college i'm very disappointed with professors at college they're only required to be in their office five hours out of the entire week some of them only have two or three classes and at the most they probably spend five hours in their classes and five hours that they're required to be in their office that's ten hours a week they're probably making more i know they're making more than my father and he you know he's making like forty five thousand and a lot of them have like other part like i know a lot of the business majors and computer hum professors they have other jobs like some of them may be accountants and they do accounting you know and this is just to me it seems like it's a hobby to them and i don't and i've even expressed to some of my professors i don't think it's right as i think they should be spending more time and too they they teach the same class year after year well i know one professor he comes up from Pittsburgh you know and he hasn't changed his tests or even his you know presenting material in years you can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for your midterm and final and as long as you study those notes from two years ago you're still going to do fine in his class that's incredible that's incredible and i i i don't think it i don't think it's right at all just like you're not even teaching any more you don't care you're getting paid whether we show up or not i mean uh i i just i'm very disappointed with the so when he files his lesson plans for the year he just he just drags out the old ones and just files them and nobody even looks at them and all that is fine and yeah uh-huh yeah he just has the same outlines year after year so he's getting away with it so is it is it his fault or is it his boss or the people that he has to respond to report to i i don't know because you know we fill out a student evaluation form every semester you fill one out on your professors and i know and who does that me and along with other students we we have the same complaints year after year and nothing seems to be getting done so i don't know if they even who does that go to though who does that evaluation form it's supposed to one's supposed to go to the professor himself and um another is supposed to go to like the administration i don't know if they're just doing it to satisfy the students so they think that we're doing something that's what it sounds like or th ey're usually really using it but i know we complain about the same thing year after year you know do they do they ever publish any results um no how about the student newspaper um what about it would it be wise to put an article in there say you know we're doing these evaluations and every year we're we're making the same evaluations but yet the administration's not looking at the evaluations oh well you know they've even done stuff like that our teachers are now telling us that these do you know apply they please fill them out properly you know we are really are using them they tell us that but we don't see any you know yeah what do you think uh can be done i have no clue what you mean i don't know what else we can do as far as um well one other's things probably is i don't know if it happens down there but every time the contracts teachers' contracts come up it's just before school season starts and they all go on strike so they close the schools down until they get what they want um-hum what's the matter with the uh students doing the same thing say hey uh we're we want a quality education and we're not getting it let's go on strike you know then see what you're going to do it'll create a lot of headlines that's for sure yeah my high school had a walk out two years ago  okay um i have i have i purchased a gun um recently and um i wouldn't i i feel like that the way i feel about it that uh you know it would be nice if you get could get rid of guns completely although i do like to shoot them for sport but i don't think you're going to be able to do that and to make it difficult um-hum you know i think people are going to get guns uh no matter what some somewhere or other so make it difficult for the for the for the good people of the world i don't think it's going to solve the problem so that's my opinion yeah i think um i i'm a i'm an advocate of uh gun control um Maryland i think you'd be surprised is is very pro gun control really yeah as a state in fact we have um they're now introducing some of the more most restrictive gun control laws here in Maryland and uh the um NRA did a nationwide nationwide campaign to raise money to defeat uh Maryland's um local state laws and lost Maryland uh voted in favor to have gun gun control here i think the problem is is because of um we have there's so much crime in the adjoining community of Washington DC that um we're hoping that they could you know if they put in more stricter laws then that crime won't reach out into Maryland which is in a sense a suburb of that um i guess they're experiencing now i don't know two murders or three murders a day in Washington DC normally associated with automatic weapons so i think that's the um that's the big press up in the Northeast is that they want to remove automatic weapons okay well yeah i so yeah i can understand you know guns for and we everybody else in Maryland supports that and hopefully and hopefully well we have we have a very high crime rate here in Houston yeah so we're dealing with uh yeah i i think what you'll find though is that the East Coast is very situation uh is pro gun control uh-huh uh-huh i know i am but like you know you're a hunter and you're a sport you're a sport hunter that's true and and that that's why you know in a sense how it doesn't it does inconvenience you but it could save lives i think is the way we look at it here and we're seeing so many murders um between uh in in Washington DC well do you think though that i mean if you have to wait seven days in order to purchase a gun are they really going to do these background checks and and if they really well i think the i think the long run is is to get um is to get and this is very active in the politics politics here in Maryland now then the long run there's also there's a bill being trying to be passed right now i guess through federal the federal legislature on um instant checkups a a total computerized system i've heard about that but they say it's so so going to be so expensive they'll never do it right and it's year it's years away but it it will be it probably will be implemented on the East Coast first because the FBI headquarters is here in in Virginia and the this will probably be the places that will start to come in faster so yeah it will take a while before um it comes in but that's one reason why i guess the the plan is here in Maryland um because i actually just received uh information from my um uh the um Brady Organization that um they want this seven day bill passed until the um the new bill until they can actually have a computerized system and i think the idea of the Brady Bill is to have this seven day waiting period to be able to check up on gun purchases or whatever um until they can do it automatically on a large computerized system yeah but what what's going to happen to the uh purchasing of guns illegally i meant i meant the guy who shot Brady was he had he purchased his gun many months before he actually committed the deed oh sure that's that's true but he had uh he had a history of of depression and and suicidal behavior you know that's true they that may be true but if he wanted a gun i meant i meant you can purchase almost anything you want illegally meant there is a way to get it do you think he's not smart enough to figure that out um-hum yeah well i don't think he would have been i think that his his type of crime i don't i don't think he would have been i think a street criminal would be you know like what you find in Washington DC don't think so um-hum they would be capable of doing it i don't think this fellow would have i think i think the idea is that they also um my idea too is to remove the automatic weapons from um-hum from the markets you know not to be able to purchase walk into a store and buy an automatic weapon right so you think maybe some of the people who are mentally incapacitated that will eliminate some of that which which really right it'll it'll eliminate some of the you know that that type of crime or whatever yeah and i mean if you can eliminate any you're doing right you can do anything yeah and i i think that's you're doing well you know in a sense uh i have friends that are peace activists and i'm not that extreme Everything they think that everything comes down to you know the whole world but i just think that right now we should do a little bit better checking and and um and i i believe totally that automatic weapons should not be sold in this country um those are you know paramilitary i don't think even sport you know do you know anybody that sport hunts with a automatic weapon see and i don't either so and i do have friends my brother is a lifelong member of the NRA so it's fun you know it's um but it's just a belief you know i guess we all work towards um what we think will make it a better society yeah that's true um-hum and everybody's differences of opinion are probably good that's what makes our you know well yeah i'm you know i just you know i just couldn't understand what uh Sarah Sarah Brady just needs something to do i mean this doesn't seem to be you know what is she really going to accomplish if this goes through i mean it's really not going to solve anything yeah but if you're also talking does this have anything her bill have anything to do with the automatic weapons yeah but it's a start no but it's a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next you can't you can't do it all at once you has to do it gradually step by step yeah you can't do it all at once yeah so once if you can um i guess if you can show the put a seven day waiting period in you can mobilize for that then you can also um uh if you show the weakness in the NRA which is a big lobby you know hopefully you can show enough weakness um from the the the gun control advocates you can show enough weakness that you can you know get the President to put a total ban on on assault weapons or the legislatures you know i guess once this passes in some areas and then if you after a year or so you have some statistics to work on that would show that it that yeah it does work yeah well that's yeah um-hum it has cut down at least in this area so maybe somebody else would want to right yeah and see now and if it doesn't work i would be the first one to say you know just like prohibition didn't work if it doesn't work i think i'd be one of the first ones to say okay you know it hasn't worked in five years it hasn't reduced any crime the statistics still show the same so but it doesn't uh won't do anything to uh in other words step if they you know i meant i i still keep my gun and you keep your gun if you have one um-hum yeah so it doesn't eliminate what's already out there but just well see you already registered i think the idea is to get a better idea of who purchases guns um right what type of person purchases what type of of gun and and and also you know the idea that somebody can go out you know a lot of the the mass murderers you know like that one fellow that walked into the Post Office purchased he was severely depressed um from he'd just lost his job um the he was severely depressed he'd been taking depressant drugs or whatever and he walked into a a store bought automa tic weapons bought bullets drove immediately back to the Post Office and shot his former oh right right uh supervisor you know and i think the idea is if you put a seven day waiting period on some of these instant crimes you know this fellow may seek help before he murders you know ideas like that right hum and you know in in all honesty i think all of us believe that uh that um uh you know people kill guns don't that's true that's true you know that i i think but the idea is to is the the compulsive neurotic by gun killer so do you think there well i guess there are quite a few of those there there are and and they always take a number of people with them so i that's the unfortunate thing the innocent yeah i meant not that anyone should die yeah see and in the back of my mind if we save one life if if you save one life you have to wait seven days probably less because if you have a clean record it probably would be faster than seven days you know but you have to wait seven but how would how would anyone how would how if i went to buy a gun and and i had been under the care of a psychologist for the last ten years how would they have a record of that you have to wait oh they probably wouldn't not yet they probably wouldn't i mean that's something that's privileged information that's doctor patient type thing um-hum um-hum so how how is that going to you know how how is that going to work well they might contact maybe an immediate member of your family and and ask them if you know they thought that you were capable oh it isn't you're really talking big bucks to start doing this kind of thing sure yeah but i i think it's worth it you know that's yeah you know they have strict gun laws in in London and they have and England and they have very few murders by by uh automatic weapons and and uh uh guns you know even the even the police for the longest time didn't really carry guns and all over Great Britain though the English but are are there are there uh uh an equal amount of per capita number of killings by other means no it's far less than what we have in the United States we're like the murder capital of the world in the civilized world you know above third world countries yeah sure would be nice to feel safe again wouldn't it yeah and i don't know it's it's just who knows it's an argument i guess um-hum you know but i see that's the thing i totally a hundred percent see everybody's point my brother's a member of the NRA we argue about this over dinner and my mother and dad don't care one way or another so they just always say oh just shut up boys well i'm glad i talked to you because i have some i got some uh information from the other side because i was yeah well and you know what's really funny is that it  okay i will i guess i will start and say that i keep up uh with current events mostly from three or four areas um-hum and i'll tell you what they are and uh then you uh would you please uh tell me how you do it sure i think i keep up better with what's going on in the world from the newspaper but i usually am introduced to subjects by television and then if something that struck your fancy then you pay attention more to that kind of topic then when you get the newspaper exactly in more detail um-hum um-hum i also take uh Time magazine and i enjoy that a lot and uh i get a lot of uh i think pretty good detail there and uh i'm pretty i'm pretty satisfied with i think those and some friends who are who are very knowledgeable um-hum yes and how how do you well basically the same thing i i know uh my husband's favorite radio station in all the world is KRLD he we wake up to KRLD we go to sleep at night to KRLD and i used to just really argue about that and battle that and i don't so much anymore because i do want to keep up and know what's going on and it helps i don't often uh have time to sit down and watch the evening news kind of thing but if i'm around during the daytime and have a chance i'll switch on CNN always have watched CNN ever since we got the cable yes uh you know coverage that provided for that and have always enjoyed it and am glad to see them getting a little uh boost these days since the uh war a little more uh recognition and credibility yes yes i've i uh have access to Time and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal all of which i rely on more i think than what i get over network TV news yes and like you you know knowledgeable friends i work for a fellow who is uh in the oil industry internationally and travels a lot to third world countries and all around and i feel like a lot of times what we get from his contacts is far more valid wonderful then you know but that's only in a real specialized area you know that's not that's just political it's not the medical arena it's not technology particularly although sometimes it overlaps of course into those kinds of things but i don't think i would be satisfied if all i had was just television no you know the uh the newspapers i think you know they uh i think a lot of the meat of what i get out out of the newspaper's not on the front page i think that's right too well especially The Wall Street Journal yeah yeah i uh i have really enjoyed being able to have access to that the last couple of years it uh don't you find though that it's hard to find time yes to yeah to the reading is The Wall Street Journal if i don't read it the day that it comes in then if they start piling up on me then i have to just forget about about it usually um-hum um-hum well and you know you just take a a newspaper just your your regular daily average big city newspaper there's more information in one than an entire month magazine you know monthly periodical yes and a lot of times i'll just take the whole thing soon as i get it and i take out the sections i want trash the rest otherwise you like you say the the stack of paper is so large really it's unmanageable just in your home situation it really is and especially if you're trying to you know save papers for recycling um-hum that's right yeah just terrible job but uh i think i enjoy uh Time and i i get Insight and i don't like that magazine very much i i'm not familiar with that one it looks like a little Time um-hum um-hum but it is not written as well as Time staff uh writers do but i i like some of those magazines because they just choose certain subjects i guess uh-huh and deal with a uh well i'm a nonfiction oriented kind of person anyway oh i enjoy a good novel but you know given the choice in the doctor's office when they're all lined up i'm much more apt to grab the Time or Newsweek or US News and World Reports than i ever would People or McCall's or although i've you know i read those kinds of things too occasionally and and and find things that are current and well updated but i don't know i just just my particular predisposition i i tend more the other way so i try not to ever find myself in a situation without something to read because my reading time comes in yes right little snatches i have five kids so by the time i get around to actually reading i have you know i may have ten or fifteen minutes of slot to read so i guess you have five children well uh-huh well they're good kids uh oh well of course and this you know this is another reason though i think that ah makes me real aware and encouraging because i know there's always a a a tidbit of information that's going to come across some i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report exactly so if i hear a statistic that's interesting or whatnot even just driving in the car i'll make a little note and uh you know of where that came from and the time i heard it and whatnot so they can use that in a bibliography well you are passing good information on to them aren't you i hope so i hope so i think kids tend to watch news for the sensationalism my kids love to watch the news but it's not always you know you wonder if it's for the right reason yes right not just the gore they've heard it though yeah yeah but i think it's a good habit to sure it is to establish uh it has been nice talking to you thank you so much and uh enjoyed it a great deal i'll uh just be anxious to tell my daughter's friend that there's a nice lady out there there really is it's beautiful and that there's she's not falling off the face of the earth it really is beautiful you will enjoy i know she will enjoy it well my daughter hopes to come visit before too long so we're uh we're anxious to point that way sometime take care and have a good day oh good thank you you too bye-bye  about how many calls have you made on this system uh i've originated only a a few oh okay yeah but i've received quite a few i uh i only started doing it after uh i started getting calls and said oh heck that's right i'm supposed to make a few calls so i started about month ago and i this is getting close to twenty here which i think is about all uh-huh uh our little gift book goes up to but i don't really know oh yeah i've got about twelve tickets in the mail do you have you've a few yeah i've been getting mine okay uh medical go ahead i'm i'm medical that's mine uh you pushed the record button we're supposed to be discussing the subject yeah i i'm benefits go ahead you first yeah uh well i'll tell you i've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies and uh it's hard to beat any of the benefits that or salaries either um-hum that we get from TI i'm quite pleased with it course there's a few things that uh i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the CEO's seat but um oh yeah i think Jerry's doing a pretty good job as it goes the one it's kind of like uh automobile insurance the ones uh that i think are the highest and important to me uh i hope i never have to use them really per se although i've used medical a little bit uh uh-huh that well that one certainly is high i i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen you know be better and better then salary salary salary continuance i've never used that one i hope i never will but that's kind of like an insurance thing i sure like that one well ah yes that's like automobile insurance you never want to get in an accident but it you like to have it there um-hum well uh like i say i worked for several different companies and there's nothing to compare with uh TI here um-hum now i really got caught up back in eighty five i got caught up in the oil layoff uh i wasn't with GSI but i was connected with uh uh oil uh exploration right with TI or somebody else no with TI uh-huh but i say i wasn't connected with GSI oh right yeah and i got caught up in a layoff now um-hum uh course you get six months uh unemployment from the state yeah but what TI did for us is is uh i i've never heard of it before they fixed us up with an office with uh telephones access to long distance uh computers a secretary to take messages for us or type uh letters for us right uh they had out of town newspapers and then the company and outside consultants didn't they have an outside consultant too i beg your pardon did they have an outside consultant like a uh yes they they did have uh seminars every once in a while the employee yeah uh cause that was not uh restricted just to just us right but the most important thing was that uh they had made up the difference between uh unemployment pay and seventy five percent of my net pay and they then TI paid me that oh really so uh i was able to uh not just exist i mean i i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off yeah they seem to be doing doing a good job of that i'm in facilities and and our organization built builds those facilities over in Park Central now uh-huh and i guess they've been using them for six months now and i've known several engineers that got laid off and they said it's like getting a PhD almost they the much they learn over there you know after they've been laid off uh one engineer said it was really an education he he just learned like you he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own he was very thankful for that too well this was not a learning thing by any means it was just a uh uh an assistance trying to find another job to have an office yeah yeah well he said he learned so much and how he thought he thought he had a PhD in how to get a job after he was through the whole process for for several months he did eventually get a job oh uh-huh well course i went through this uh what about five years ago they may have improved it considerably yeah apparently it's very sophisticated and i guess it may be one of the best uh that anyone's doing well that's one of those little uh uh little extras that you don't see in the uh the the the handbook you know right you're absolutely right that's a good one it what do you think about pensions anything on that or well now i have uh uh i'm getting close to retirement yeah and of course i've been looking into it but uh since i'm only a yellow badger i won't be getting a whole heck of a lot from TI as far as retirement is concerned um-hum right what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like an account like a 401K account i i've been thinking about that for years uh i've never heard of such a thing i know that's what i'm saying that that pensions you see just like you were you're saying you've only got uh so many years say you work for two three companies if you take your pension with you after you're vested um-hum and then just add the money together like you do with a 401K account you know uh yeah uh it's your account period it doesn't matter where you go or anything that's your account to roll over i that that sounds like a hell of an idea i didn't know there was such a thing no no there isn't i i'm saying that's the question what do you think could be better and i'm saying that pensions say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away which it probably will i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose you work for a company seven years yes by all means well what would be the difference between that and social security uh well social security's going to go to way i think and you can or you can invest your own money you have no control over your social security and it's not paid for by the current like when say we retire after the year two thousand social security's paid for by the twenty five year olds you know they may rebel and you won't have any social security where if your money was in your account i mean you can never lose it it's there you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you you know yeah yeah that's just a thought i mean i uh-huh no i i like the idea course that's that's some something like an IRA if they say which yeah yeah and instead of having a a socialized pension it just would be really money that you and your company maybe you had to put some money in it too i don't really know uh-huh but i i can see where they'd need to do something on that because the statistics are you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own you know you work for five six seven and you you a lot of people i know guys yeah that that's what i've done i i've bounced around about every ten years i change yeah i have too but not not quite that often but uh yeah i've only got uh i've got fourteen now here at TI and i hope to make twenty five but say if something happened to me i mean you know they lay me off uh you have a pension but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one it would be nice if they could get them together um-hum i do worry about medical though again knock wood that uh i haven't used it i guess you i'm sorry you really do use it throughout the year because you get your teeth fixed and all that i mean i but i'm not i'm talking about major items i haven't used it for anything major uh-huh i'm glad it's there though well knock wood i haven't used mine anything for anything major just doctor visits and well i i have the uh the Homa i use Homa yeah and i like that uh a lot better than Aetna i have the regular i again i just i haven't i can't complain about it because i haven't used it and every time i needed it it it it's uh you know uh-huh fallen right in line for the the minor things i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others well doesn't it work you don't see uh uh anything until you spend the minimum don't you have to spend the minimum of two three hundred uh yeah yeah i think it's two seventy five for a family but the dental is right away if you exams uh yeah well now i have the same dental you have okay yeah the medical you have to have a deductible uh-huh now see i don't have a deductible yeah right i pay a straight five dollars for anything a doctor visit or drugs well drugs are okay now i'm on that uh plan where i take blood pressure medicine if you take an allergy medicine so anything you need a prescription for for more than six months you get it for used to be six bucks they just raised it to twelve oh that one i haven't heard about yeah that's a typical that's a typical one that's in there the forms are right in personnel uh-huh fact you may be able to take care of take advantage of that it's through Baxter Labs uh yeah i have high blood pressure problems myself well maybe you still can do that do you do you buy your pills one at a time every thirty days at a time well turn turn in your forms go right to personnel i don't know whether you have to about an HMO i don't think so you turn you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription and uh they're twelve dollars again they just were six they just raised them to twelve this year twelve dollars for a three months supply hum or whatever whatever the the amount is uh i don't want to say three months but uh-huh it's a lot cheaper allergy medicine's really uh expensive and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive i take two go right to personnel they got the forms in personnel and maybe i maybe i've told you go something you didn't know about in benefits there um yeah yeah i just might do that i do it yeah i you know it's a very common thing it's through Baxter Labs tell yeah well thanks thanks for the tip Jim i i shall look into it yeah what else i'm sure we're getting close to our five minutes whatever here yeah uh let's see we discussed uh uh medical and dental what other benefits uh retirement yeah the salary continuation i think that's a great one but again a hope i never use that one that means you're really sick if you have to use that one uh-huh what about vacation i'm satisfied with the vacation i don't know what else you know you nice to say you get another week uh and when i'm well i only got fourteen years so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen uh yeah that's right so that's that's fair i mean it's reasonable if four weeks is a lot i think i know some people who have twenty five years and thirty and they want more but uh you know um-hum uh well i'm uh i'm here i've got just eleven years and i don't think i'll ever see a a silver badge i won't i won't be around that long um-hum well the way things go i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventy five whether i quit and uh uh or when i retire get a part-time job  uh so i uh weight train uh three days on and one day off uh so what do you do to exercise um-hum i uh ride bicycles um fifteen twenty miles i don't know maybe three times maybe four times a week i play basketball uh couple times a week i play softball one night a week hm uh that's what i do what about yourself hm that's pretty impressive um i guess i bicycle uh the amount varies as much as a hundred fifty miles a week um uh-huh i guess i play softball one night a week and i backpack a lot over the summer oh really yeah that's that's about the extent of it i mean i don't do any of those things particularly you know for exercise but um i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of like do if i feel like i need to go exercise um but i do it mostly for fun yeah what um what do you ride uh like bunch of hills or flat pretty flat it it it varies uh out near my house is pretty hilly um but sometimes i bike to work which is about um a fifteen mile trip each way and that's mostly flat how long does that take you to get to work about forty five fifty minutes how does how does that work work out with uh storing your bike and showering and all that yeah it can be a pain um basically uh i work on a campus so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the uh campus to the uh gym use the shower there uh but it's it's enough of a pain that uh-huh i did it consistently one year i would commute everyday um but it just became such a pain i mean we were talking you know forty five or fifty minutes for biking um and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind right and then another half an hour you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff it was a big hunk of well hunk of the day um and then of course another hour to get back home um so i've been doing that less and and concentrating more on you know light biking when i get home on the evening and then you know some more on the weekends yeah do you ride a lot of rallies are lot of those around there not so much um i guess mostly i bike on my own i've got a touring bike uh-huh um though i haven't gone on any extended trips with it how about you what kind of biking do you do uh well actually my wife just got me into it and i did a did an internship at the Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas at Cooper Clinic and i learned all the health benefits of um-hum i you know i was a solid weight trainer and all i did was weights and anaerobic exercise and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise said you really need to do it so um-hum um-hum once i got into this uh internship i learned all the physiological advantages advantages advantages to it so i began a program couple i don't know probably three or four weeks ago and i did my first bike rally this Saturday i did uh forty forty miles hm and uh that's the longest i've ever ridden so far i usually you know fifteen or twenty and it was it was kind of hilly and it was pretty tough but um-hum uh i'm looking at uh doing a lot more of it because you know my wife is really into it and i i kind of oh i see held her back a little bit this this weekend she wanted to go go go but you know she wanted to stay with me um-hum it's good to have a partner yeah it really is are you you thinking of doing any like centuries or yeah that'd be cool sometime if i could you know work up to that um-hum yeah i just wondered if you're were gonna do that mostly or more like you know uh um uh touring like from Vermont or you know that kind of thing i mean people seem to get into different aspects one is more of a distance and one's more just you know they wanna oh put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour i've never really looked into that that you know that's my wife would just love that and i may do that sometime there again i'm just kind of a fledgling into this um-hum um-hum i've it's kind of funny i'd called this number and i just reading through a a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up i mean around Texas you got yeah yeah you got about five or six different if you live around the Dallas area you got five or six every weekend to choose from because they're really into it oh that's nice hm bicycling's really big here i didn't know that and you know till i came down here and just kind of caught the fever because i lived in Indiana all my life and wow yeah you know you may say one see one or two guys on a bicycle that are above the age of fifteen or something but other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here um-hum yeah i'm not sure why that is i mean generally in the midwest it seems to be less much less i mean maybe it's because of the winters probably uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation yeah yeah and there's a lot of bikers around here it's it's really neat um-hum there are a lot of a lot of resources lot of magazines and stuff little Texas Bicyclist is like a newspaper that comes out every month hm and it's free you just go to the bike shock bike bike shop and pick it up and it's got all the rides coming up so i guess i'm gonna be busy about every Saturday this summer going to a different ride yeah see a little bit of Texas i've never seen before oh that's terrific um-hum so uh how long have you been biking oh i guess as an adult for just about the past uh three years or so um you know i guess the last time i did it before that was college which was about ten years ago and uh yeah i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while um yeah until i suddenly disevered all my friends were basically biking a lot and so i thought i'd try it too have you ever had a uh it's kind of slightly off the subject but you ever had a uh a blood work up done recently or since you been biking to see if it because it really no i haven't no from what i understand it really improves your uh cholesterol and and you know it uh it kind of knocks you down two uh the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is uh hm uh low cardiovascular fitness and also uh you know the cholesterol it gives you uh increased HDLs and decreases your LDLs yeah so um-hum oh that's great yeah i've i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate my resting pulse you know it gets it down to about forty yeah yeah really that's good yeah you say you ride about a hundred hundred fifty miles a week man that's that's hard core when do you get to begin with the winters and all that yeah on average yeah or what time of the year do you usually embark on your do you ride inside if you can't ride outside no i'm not that hard-core i mean there are some people in fact there are a lot of people who'll ride outside in the snow they've got a uh mountain bike you know with the big knobby tires yeah and i don't do that i basically i i pretty much lay off for the winter uh-hum i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter you know because it'll help your balance when you're indoor training hm um but but i just you know more or less stuck to like an exercise bike and that kind of thing um but yeah i mean winters are kind of a problem so i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking i guess this year for just a couple of weeks uh-huh um but you know up here it's it's only stopped snowing since then uh yeah but yeah it's it's it's it's pretty good it's uh the main the main thing i guess for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like you know exercise and a chore i'll lay off of it more right so you uh change up your routes a lot and keep a oh yeah yeah i try to go someplace pretty different you know every week i rotate around um about four different routes um from my house or i'll sometimes come in to school it's nice coming it's nice it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path um because it's just it's along the Erie Canal up here uh University of Rochester so what school is it oh okay yeah so that's fairly picturesque and uh so it's it's it's a good ride as long as you're not doing it everyday it's a good ride yeah yeah that's true sounds neat it's kind of i was wondering if i was gonna yeah talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week that's something motivating yeah that's really good well well it was good talking to you good talking to you and keep up the good work all right take care bye okay you too bye  okay okay yeah i'm originally from New York and i go visit a lot and their real estate up there is i mean ridiculous absolutely ridiculous oh an apartment here like i live in an apartment and my apartment is three fifteen a month and it's just the one it's a one bedroom and how big is it which is still kind of expensive but i prefer to live in uh in a nice part of town because i feel safe here and i i i pay more to feel safe you know yeah right well what's what's included in that you mean in a one bedroom oh nothing hum-um i mean just like washer dryer or nothing nothing no microwave we've got i have ceiling fan i guess that's something it's real cute it's got a little vaulted ceiling and mirrored um mirrored uh wow yeah which one is it it's Wood um listen to me i can't even think of the name of my own apartment Woodhollow right next to Village Green it's on yeah kind of far North Waco where oh okay okay yeah i i used to live in Waco so oh okay yeah far north like on Lake Shore where all those apartments are it's right up there so yeah yes yes yeah um we live in a house here and uh it's uh-huh a three bedroom two bath and uh i it's it i don't know i got two numbers today actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent and uh it's about sixteen hundred square feet which is fine for the two of us uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh right but it it you know we looked at a lot of houses that were had more square footage but they didn't use it right you know it was a bunch of empty uh-huh right uh-huh you know hallway and stuff that yeah yeah really so we've used every bit of it and our house um that could have been used as yeah yeah we bought it for sixty four and uh the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventy five um uh-huh so i you know i think we were you know got a good deal on it considering yeah yeah yeah well yeah so that looks good when you all get ready to sell you'll probably do really well my father used to live in Dallas uh now he he went back to New Jersey we're originally from the East but he oh really my husband's from New Jersey oh really he uh well actually right now he lives in Rhode Island he lived in New Jersey for a while now he's in Rhode Island and um he used to like to go and we used to go just every weekend just to look at houses for no reason we weren't buying one every weekend but just to look at them and so i got a pretty good feel of you know what i want when i do you know get my house whenever that is um what was i going to say about that i completely lost my train of thought um but we we enjoy going looking at houses and and um we now i kind of have a good idea of what i want i know i want a big family area um yeah that's what we were looking for the first thing yeah fire a fireplace i saw this awesome house the other weekend it was a great big family room and it was circular and the other side was the patio and the backyard and it had a built in uh grill and every i mean it was it was just an ultimate the ultimate party room you know i was but that's pretty nice wow um-hum yeah but that's what we had uh uh that's what we had looked for was our main concern was a big living room you know and big closet space you know i said um-hum right yeah i like a lot of closet space i don't like because i don't like to have a lot of things out you know just all over the place i like to have them kind of tucked away yeah yeah and uh so that's that's what we went for first and and it you know we we don't we just have a big living room an and a dining room is separate um-hum and you know some places have like the house next door to us that we looked at had a living room a dining room and a den but to stick a wall between two rooms um-hum right didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den so we opted for the just the whole wide room that went from one end of the house to the other just about um-hum um-hum my father had uh i keep talking about my father because he owned a house um he had the kitchen kind of a kitchen and a very long family room it's just kind of one room and what he did he put uh a bar right in the center and put some um a glass rack yeah oh yeah down so you had like wine glasses hanging from the ceiling and then the bar and it just kind of it kind of separated it it was still you know together but it just looked a lot better yeah because i personally don't like the combination yeah rooms so right i but i i think for where we are um i think we got a real good deal on it and we you know we have a uh um-hum the backyard is just huge it is just really i think another house could fit back there um-hum yeah i'd like a big backyard and uh we really liked it of course when you have to mow it you know in uh middle of August it's it's kind of a little hot yeah but uh it's it's nice and that was oh really yeah a little hot try to do it early in the mornings um you know a big selling point too and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us uh-huh and they've lived there and have it all built up you know they've got a whole garden and trees and everything so it's not like we're uh kind of secluded you know we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours hum wow uh-huh well that's good yeah yeah you know right up to our bathroom window or whatever it is like a lot of the little model homes that they you know throw up in three days uh-huh that's true they do throw those up and uh are you all planning to move anytime are you looking for a house or not um-hum um-hum no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh um-hum winning a sweepstakes and what would we do with the money and Steve said we'll i'll buy a bigger house and i said no i would just fix this one you know there's you know because we i like where it is and i like how it's laid out and it took us forever um-hum yeah really um-hum to find it um-hum to find it but when we found it it was we knew it yeah you knew that was it i'll probably i'll probably move but i'll probably move to another apartment or something because i'm i'm i'm really yeah have you had any um what's the word i move a lot anyway because the job i have i only work like here i'll be here for like a year and then i'll move off i can move up yeah where and so i'm a i'm a news reporter i work at Channel Six and so this is like my first job so i won't be here very long so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house oh okay oh okay right right you know so i'm staying staying in an apartment and i'm not married or anything so it's no biggie um yeah and that's and that's one thing is once you you know you get into a house it's like you you get more stuff um-hum and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work God i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff and it actually fit you know of course we got it on a little bit of more furniture and stuff but yeah yeah um-hum yeah yeah like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment because up to this point i was in school and so i'd go home every summer yeah and i could take all my stuff home because i didn't have a bed or a couch or any any of that but now i could not move back home and i just realized this you know the other day i'm going wait a minute i can't go back home for the summer or anything i have too much stuff so yeah yeah it was just like a weird transition out of home so i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff yeah and that's actually three fifteen over there's probably not real real bad for for Waco and and for as many gosh as many as apartments and condos are over there no it's not it's not yeah oh my goodness yeah um-hum i mean it it's just and and especially around Lake Shore area that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there and uh um-hum yeah um-hum there there are tons of apartments down here i mean and it yeah because i i had lived in the gosh i'm not sure what they're called now but they were Lake Shore Apartments that are like right next to the baseball field MCC Baseball field but MCC yeah yeah i i think they're called Lake Shore Villa or something no the ones next door to those there were Lake Shore there's a i don't know what they look like now hum and it's a nursing there was a nursing home or something like that yeah there was a nursing home and then there's an apartment and then there's another apartment and we lived in those those third ones and they we moved in when they were brand new uh you know we drive by now and think gosh you know look how much it's changed an um-hum um-hum um i think that uh-huh yeah how often do you all come through Waco oh ever now and then um it just we um-hum depends on what's going on it's uh yeah and it's not really now that it's sixty five it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there you know run to the mall or run to Sam's or um-hum um-hum yeah or whatever we used to run to Red you know Red Lobster but now they've got one in Killeen so we don't have to run that far so that's that's about how things are and the seems like the market here's picking up yeah i really think it is um-hum all right hum you think uh-huh uh-huh um just for the fact that the you know it's it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale you know and i think now a lot of them are selling and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of you know just having to give it away um Waco to me seems seems like it's pretty steady i mean i'm not a real estate person or anything but it it yeah it's a real college town and so you know you have these apartments and then the the houses are all most of the houses are pretty nice and i don't i don't you know really see a lot on sale or anything and people are pretty stable here um-hum yeah yeah you know i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community as i always call it yeah um um-hum yeah i i saw i see that a lot too there and it's nice too i liked living there nice and quiet so i don't think i could live here much longer but i'll deal with it uh-huh well i guess we chewed up the house market and apartment market for a while well it yeah really okay well it was very nice talking to you okay you take care okay bye-bye you too Tanya all right bye-bye  so um you said you don't have kids but um you're interested in the topic well yeah and um actually i'm very interested we are my husband and i are thinking very soon um about having children and i think that i am just um a little bit uh brainwashed or whatever by just thinking that kids are so wonderful and cute and i can't wait to have one and i don't see the real responsibility of it uh-huh um and an actually how dramatically your life can change when you do have children right do you have kids yes yes i have one son who's now uh eighteen and he's a sophomore in college oh oh wow and it it does but i was very lucky in that i was um teaching at a university and so basically and lived within walking distance oh so i was able when he was little just to um leave him with a neighbor in uh one of these carry cots um-hum and then go up and teach a class and come back wow because i could do my work at home and my my students who were working on their master's degrees and stuff would come to my house and i would meet with them there um-hum um-hum so it was really ideal and then later on um when he was gee maybe two and three i actually took him then i changed to a different school but it was still within walking distance oh that's great and um he spent a lot of time in my office because i was uh department chairman um-hum and um you know really didn't interfere because all his life he had sort of been used to there were quiet times uh-huh yeah and so and that worked out great that's wonderful how is it now i imagine you said he's a sophomore yes so this is is he living at home yes he's commuting it's um about gee he commutes forty five minutes a each way but he has to allow an hour and a half going to school because it's too too chancy for him to miss classes um-hum but oh really and so actually we don't i mean we still spend a lot of time together in the sense that we are always together for dinner and and um then you know he's in the house studying in the evening uh-hum and he also works and so um he usually calls me um-hum um-hum at when he gets home from school at noon i mean not not checking in but more gee you know missed you you know what with this is what's new type of thing and i think we have a very good relationship from that standpoint but i think it's uh-huh um-hum yeah unusual and i think part of it is that that we were abroad for a good part of the time that's great oh really until till um six years ago where what part of Europe well i was actually in the Middle East oh my goodness so oh how nice was he raised bilingual as a bilingual was he bilingual yeah yeah bilingual yes yeah actually um he he was more in a sense raised trilingual in that i spoke Spanish to him when he was a baby oh my goodness and then but he always answered in Arabic because he heard more Arabic than Spanish um-hum and then when we first came to visit my mother he picked up English when he was two and a half oh my gosh and he had heard me talk English on the phone but you know he hadn't he really didn't use it uh-huh that is wonderful boy i i so i am Arabic actually my background is um my my grandparents are from Syria oh where are you from oh okay and um i wish that my parents had taught me Arabic when i was younger it was really a sort of the taboo language um-hum when i was little um you know there was the whole and and there still is cause you they were newly in this country well my parents were born here my grandparents moved here um ah um-hum and then had my parents shortly after they moved here where were they where they what village in Damascus oh from Damascus okay um-hum from Damascus all of them actually oh okay and um i just i think it's a real shame because now i don't have the patience and i don't have the ability you know at my age to start learning a foreign language um-hum but when you're a kid you just pick it up so naturally yeah but see there's a big big issue there because my my family spoke German at home so that we couldn't understand um-hum oh really and and my um nieces and nephews are not learning their mother's language uh-huh so that i think this is a a tendency in the States is because it's a melting pot so i think my son had the advantage of we were actually living outside the country yeah so there was a reason for him to learn it yeah um-hum that's true yeah it's really hard yeah do you think that your being in academics um helped your son he sounds like he is very responsible and um you know seems to be concerned about his studies well i'm not so sure that it's the the academics as much as spending time with him um-hum and i've been concerned in the States since i've been back with the number particularly in the Washington area where i live now um-hum oh um with a seeing how many kids come home to empty houses and like in our court we live in our townhouse court yeah um-hum and there's seven year olds that come home and they're locked out oh jeez and you know some of the neighbors sort of feel sorry sorry for them and and you know would be very responsible if something happened but the parents aren't willing to to pay that person to sort of be in charge and and i think this is yeah um-hum i you know i've just seen so much of it here in this country that you wouldn't see in in certainly not in the Arab culture i mean uh-huh yeah oh no that for sure people people are more important than things so and then everyone wonders why why like you said that seven year old you know why two months from now he's on drugs or something he's a terror well he's a terror he just you know climbs on cars walks around the court threatening people with sticks oh really oh jeez oh well he has no discipline i mean no one is there to tell him what's right and what's wrong yeah it right now would you continue do you work now yes i do i work full time and my husband actually is going for his PhD and uh would like to teach oh uh-huh and be a professor um hopefully somewhere in the south i i i'm from Boston and i i'm fed up with the cold weather really between Boston and Rochester um-hum um-hum but um ideally i would um i want to have a child and i'd like to be able to be home for a year right and i really just selfishly don't want to miss that uh-huh and um you know my husband's schedule hopefully will be flexible um in that he could do a lot of his work at home um-hum and um i'm not sure i i still want to work i think that's very important right to keep that up and i don't want to um you know i don't want to go several years without working outside the house uh-huh but um but i think that him being um a little bit more flexible with his schedule will really help us out a lot uh-huh so that that's nice thing about teaching right right that you he'll be able to spend more time which is so important right and i imagine that obviously your summers were a lot lighter as far as work load right actually we traveled extensively because i was doing archeology and so oh oh wow you know he was always able to come with me on all my travels because a lot of the places i went by car of course um-hum oh sure and i mean you know i was living in the middle of it and i took every advantage and and you know he doesn't dislike travel now he might not like it um-hum uh you know he might not feel compelled to travel because he has seen a lot but he's very comfortable traveling right uh-huh um-hum and so well he has done more and seen more than most people do in a lifetime it sounds like that's wonderful and it it sounds like he really appreciates it too that's right that's right right you know that that remains to be seen but yes i think so i think so that's great so does he have a girlfriend oh no no and and and i find that interesting because he's been two years ahead in the schools here oh wow and so he always you know was treated like little brother when the band needed transportation they'd say oh he can't drive so ah you know when he's a senior he can drive some of the the younger kids around type of thing um-hum and he didn't he didn't get his license i mean he was just sixteen when he graduated from high school so um-hum you know he he has friends but he doesn't have any you know he hasn't really gotten into the social thing uh-huh and he's i think that's all right he's going to it looks like finish his degree first before he gets too involved um-hum um-hum well that's a good idea yeah you know it's it's i would love when i was little i had friends and they had enormous families and i would love to have a large family it seems so expensive though to think about raising a child besides just the the essentials you know clothes and food and this and that right i really feel like there's this whole um you know you have to keep up with the Jones or whatever they say and uh you know it just seem like when i you know watch that's right but you don't have to keep up i mean kids appreciate it more if you don't really i think if if things are special and are for them they see that their kids are being bought um-hum that their friends are being bought by their parents yeah well i hope so i mean i look at these toys on TV and i just think oh my God they didn't have those when i was little uh-huh and they don't need them and they don't even appreciate them yeah i mean that's my feeling i think you know from what i see a lot of people just uh-huh it's a token you know you don't have me so you have all these material things um-hum yeah that's true well it's interesting well i don't know i think i'm ready for it a couple of years we got married a couple of years ago and i thought oh my God i'll never be ready for a kid um-hum but i i definitely think i am now oh very good and it sounds like you have good values and yeah  okay is this one of your favorite topics well i love to fish i haven't in the last few years but uh in fact yeah when i married on our honeymoon that's where we went was fishing oh my my my son would love to find a woman like that i think well yeah i really do enjoy it but i like i say i haven't been for years we used when after we got married a couple of years after we got married we got a boat and we used to fish a lot and including you know we skied too but after the kids came we stopped and um now i'm i'm divorced so yeah they have a way they have a way of influencing your life yeah they don't you know and especially when they're little like that it was difficult to have them in the boat we were always worried something would happen so we didn't what type what type of fishing did you enjoy well i liked trolling the best i i mean i like moving so instead of just sitting in one spot and i really do like to fish in the rain um-hum oh is that right yeah i and when it's not pouring i mean but when it's just a light rain i'm i really enjoy that and i find that you we use to catch a lot of fish when it was raining oh yeah do you do you like cartoons do i pardon me say that again cartoons yes cartoons yes one of the my favorite cartoons is a picture of a a fellow in a pouring a downpour raining oh now the boat is half full of water there are beer cans floating all around and the the line is in the boat with him and he's got the biggest grin on his face you've ever seen oh gosh i don't know whether i'd go that far no but when you say you enjoying enjoying the rain that uh you must be in a warm weather climate then well see the thing is when when i i am from originally from Ohio and i met my husband in Iowa and we um-hum he was from Minnesota and we went on our honeymoon to Minnesota so it was well it was in August and so it was warm enough but uh oh i because i don't enjoy cold weather at all so we we uh we lived right by a lake and it was nice yeah have you ever done any the uh ocean fishing no i have not i lived in the Bahamas for a year but i didn't do any fishing we did some scuba diving but that's all no oh i that's that's a nice sport too i think beautiful sights and it yes it's it's it's gorgeous now the only offshore fishing i've done is from the Bahamas and caught a nice big barracuda ooh how nice yeah yeah interesting interesting time i've i've been in the Great Lakes too and caught some salmon there uh-huh but i really enjoy farm pond fishing probably as as much as anything oh i've never fished in a farm pond oh you you can get out and it a fairly large pond with a lot of stumps and everything good black bass fishing um and i enjoy walking around the edge and um trying to select a spot i've even done some uh tube fishing are you familiar with that no uh-huh that's an inner tube with a special seat in it ooh and you wear waders and you have little fins that you kick around so you move move manipulate yourself anywhere you want in a pond oh how wonderful relaxing too huh yeah it's a lot of fun it is and cooling oh that sounds great you know the the uh water below helps keep you cool you may be baked in the sun in the upper half of your body but uh it's it's a nice relaxing way and oh gentle undulations of the water you know is it is nice i think oh it sounds wonderful but fishing is a good relaxing sport if you if you don't have patience i don't know if you would enjoy fishing because you no i know i know a lot of friends are really too hyper to fish they have to be moving all the time i think you have to be able to sit and and just enjoy yourself quietly if you can't do that you're not going to make a good fisherman yeah no and i think that's part of the lure is is just to be uh relaxed and with the world and no pressure not not worrying about whether you catch anything or not right well in this day and age that's wonderful to be able to do that because when we our lives are so stressful so uh do your children fish well real sad to say we don't as much as we i'm i'm divorced and and uh since we've been to Texas we haven't now in Iowa when they were little my son i used to take him fishing and they both have you know gear and we've we've gone um-hum once or twice but and there's just not that many lakes around here that i'd be interested in in going to and so no no you know and uh i just uh we just haven't and not that they i think they both would would like it they have gone with their dad and uh he lives in Arizona now and uh he lives in the Phoenix area and the mountains are real close and he's taken them up to the mountains and yeah trout fishing yeah that's fun too yeah yeah and they've enjoyed it it it's a challenge to learn to use the different equipment a fly rod entirely different technique it is yes and i'm always amazed that you can catch a large trout on a hook that small yeah isn't that it that is amazing isn't it yeah well i can remember when i was trolling i caught a and we couldn't eat this it was a a Rock Bass and of course they're not good to eat but i mean it was it was for me it was like a six pound fish and that was big for me and i was just tickled to death that the oh yeah to catch it we threw it back in but um that was i think the biggest fish i ever caught well you know in Virginia well they they do eat the Rock Bass though but well we don't in Minnesota people just don't they don't eat them for some reason so yeah i think if they if they cut around that red streak in it then you're in good shape um-hum oh is that right see we didn't know that so we just threw it back in so well that's a hybrid right it's a salt water that migrated into the fresh yes it is uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah and that it was a big thing they call Stripers in Oklahoma oh and Rock Fish i know in Virginia uh-huh and uh probably up up there too then yeah yeah have you ever done any surf casting no that's fun is it um-hum i could stand all day on the surf and you just have a lot of weight on the end of it and you're fighting the undertow so there's some action going on whether it's the fish or not all the time uh-huh and that's a a relaxing time too you would you have to repeatedly cast though in the no no uh-huh no the secret is to cast just over the break of the wave and then the undertow keeps the line moving outward in in you know it stays there for the uh flounder or or some of the other special fish too oh it's good good exercise too oh that sounds great yeah well uh when i grew up when i was growing up my dad was an avid fisherman fisherman and we had a boat and we would go out in Lake Erie because i'm from Ohio what and we would fish that was before it was so polluted and so yucky it was a beautiful lake then and um we would we would fish and and my dad would i can remember even when we were interested weren't interested in when we were younger and we'd play around the the the lake or around oh yeah and we'd go up into go uh Michigan and the rapids up there in Grand Rapids Michigan were just beautiful and he would fish he would get his you know his waders on his long boots and he would go out and we would just play by the water and just have a ball and he would fish and it was so gorgeous um-hum well and that was one of my wonderful childhood memories yeah i hope uh that the future generations have places they can go yeah isn't that scary it is it is and with all the pollution that we do have yeah yeah it it's bad Lake Erie when i haven't been home for several years but the last time i was home i was just so surprised to see how terrible Lake Erie was i mean it just was awful um and it just makes you so sad because at one time it was just a beautiful lake yep and not too long ago really right but but Sally it's been nice talking to you and i hope you get to go fishing soon it sure has well thank you and you have many good fishing days too good night bye night bye-bye  okay what kind of puppy you got well uh i think she's mostly German Shepherd uh she was uh uh a person lives across the street from me uh brought her home from work because a coworker of hers uh had this dog appear on its front doorstep somebody somebody abandoned her and she's only about oh six between six and eight six to eight weeks old uh um-hum oh and uh uh i can't understand why anyone would abandon this dog though she's almost i mean she's that this young and she's almost housebroken wow i mean she actually asks to go out and uh yeah i was that's great amazed really good temperament and very playful and affectionate good personality i don't know i can't imagine what uh would have been wrong with this dog so yeah well i i have a dog that God gave us too uh-huh yeah she just appeared oh really yeah my husband calls her street dog but we've had her now for about three years and i just you get so attached to them uh-huh oh yeah i had a uh last year i had another i had another German Shepherd now this one was purebred and uh he when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door but uh managed to get him to a veterinarian in time and uh and on huge doses of antibiotics and um-hum um he actually got over it with huh seven hundred dollars in vet bills wow um but he had actually was able to get him over that and then um-hum and then he was gaining weight again was just getting healthy and uh he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing and then he got hit by a Cadillac oh no so i couldn't believe it that was that was really hard but oh gee and that was even harder for i was on a business trip at the time and the dog was being house sit or dog sit whatever by some friends of mine down the street so they just felt absolutely awful um-hum oh i bet and i felt felt probably worse for them than than for me because oh gosh they the uh this fellow's wife who was uh watching the dog probably she i think she loved that dog more than i did and uh oh gosh she was just really attached to it but uh it's it's unfortunate but now i've got another one so yeah yeah how long has it been since the first one um see he it it was just over a year uh it was in March of last year uh yeah so um yeah it'd been didn't didn't have one for a whole year yeah well i had i had a German Shepherd before this one and when she died it just it just i absolutely destroyed me i mean i was just you know i couldn't even talk about it for months and so i decided well that's it i'm not going to do this anymore yeah right and then God gave me this dog so my dad's like that he uh he had a beagle that he loved and uh when that Beagle passed away uh he didn't want he wasn't going to have another dog there's no way no how and then uh the um-hum he the Beagle died in i guess about October and by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him uh or i Humane Society and got uh got another one a stray and yeah she she turned out to be a great dog and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently and again dad went through the whole thing but okay yeah well you just do you can't help it's like it's like a kid mom went and yeah yeah it is well hopefully this one here Cocoa will live a full life yeah well when uh my my doggy uh that we have now uh she's she's mostly Golden Retriever uh-huh the vet called her uh a golden mix like who knows you know but she's uh she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color you know yeah right oh and uh and her nose is that pink um-hum you know she doesn't have a brown nose and her eyes she's sort of unicolor you know eyes are the same color and everything so yeah i named her Rosebud huh and uh a friend of mine said she that she grew this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had uh a pet cow named Rosebud and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name said my cow lived seventeen years that's not too bad the Golden Retriever's are good dogs too they're kind of like get that permanent smile to them yeah right they're always always happy i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy and she's so easy going and so sociable yeah you know she loves everybody little kids can just you know maul all over her and she just you know right this thinks it's great this this friend of mine has the well it's the same guy that was watching uh my German Shepherd when he got hit but uh went fishing with him on Friday and took he's got a full a pure bred Golden Retriever and then i had uh the puppy a little tiny puppy and we went and took the two dogs up fishing and this they just they had a ball romping around and you know you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in uh-huh getting in yeah and uh this Golden Retriever jumped in the the really fast moving uh river current and uh oh no well no actually he had no trouble at all he first jumped in and i he's he's just about a year old himself and never had really i don't think he'd swum before but he jumped in in the the river really did puppy go to well the puppy jumped in the into some of the pools but not into the i was careful to keep her away from the oh that's good yeah the fast moving water because if she fell in then i'd of been had to go in after her and up here the waters probably about forty degrees right now ewe ewe and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her but uh this dog Dennis jumped in and got this look on his face like what do i do now as he's floating down the river then finally discovered that he could swim and uh actually paddled up against the current and uh made it back to the shore and climbed up and then he he jumped in again and he was swimming for quite a bit all afternoon he loved it yeah Cocoa didn't think too much of it though she jumped in and then started screaming and uh made me pull her back out i pulled her out and uh then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad and yeah so but she got over it so well the German Shepherd that i had before we we had a little pool uh-huh and uh she was she did not want any part of swimming but she liked to to get in the pool on the first step she'd just get on the first step and lay down uh-huh you know in the summertime when it's really really hot yeah and she'd just lay there on that step and just you know cool off yeah i've i live right across the street from a a big lake here um it's on Oneida lake and i'm wondering if uh if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year i mean i've got the yards all fenced in so she doesn't run loose but uh um-hum yeah she could go in sometime when if i'm watching her something yeah but uh well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that oh really yeah and she oh baths oh gee she hated baths worse than anything it was it was just really a fight to you know get her clean yeah have you seen uh Canine no no the movie oh you've got to see it especially since you have a German it is so cute oh really yeah and uh an part of the the movie is where he's trying to clean this dog up and it's it's just hysterical oh okay my my dog last German Shepherd it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too and that was the thing i couldn't figure out because he would go in the lake it wasn't like he didn't ah um-hum normally i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet but if you wanted to get him wet forget it yeah well that's how Cleo was you know she'd lay on her step yeah but that was that was the only time she wanted to get wet and she didn't want you getting her wet right right obstinate obstinate yeah but you really need to see that movie i i we we bought the movie and i don't i don't know how many times i've seen it and it came on TV the other night and i was watching it again and my husband heard me laughing and he said i can't believe that you're still getting such a kick out of that movie uh-huh huh i'll have to check it out i saw the the uh previews for it and all and it did look like it'd be a good movie movie but uh it is great really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately but yeah i got to do more more fun things like well we always wait until we can rent them you know yeah yeah well i'm uh i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force and so i travel a lot and yeah i'm a engineer at uh at the laboratory Rolm Laboratory Griffis Air Force Base up here so oh really oh that's how i got into uh into the switchboard project and all that so uh-huh but it's nice having a dog here uh the oh yeah oh no oh no what's the unrequired what's the word i'm looking for uh lots of affection there's just right no conditional unconditional affection from the from the dog that's it really yeah yeah not critical at all yeah they're really wonderful no no yeah well it's been nice talking to you we seem to be degenerating here so  okay well do you have any formal programs in your area sure i used to cycle around the block two or oh no yeah i recycled once before no yes actually we do we have Berkeley is a very avant-garde recycling city somehow that doesn't surprise me yeah they they go around and they give you these boxes and you you fill these boxes up and you take them out and they leave you know uh you leave them on the curbstone and every Thursday or some such day they come by and pick them up problem is you end up with these boxes in your home that you know get pretty piled up with such things as glass and tin cans and newspapers and and and by the time you you manage to drag one downstairs you know it's it's work i i i just the the there there's got to be a better way of incorporating it you know somehow so that the manufacturers uh yeah uh that there's an incentive to get it back to them yeah what i i don't know we we there are some beginnings of formal programs where we are though they're not in our town i mean Jackie and i uh recycle cans you know we just we just fill up a we have a trash can set aside for aluminium cans and when it gets full we just take it down and drop it off at the recycling center but that's about the extent of ours uh i don't it seems to me like if if they really wanted to get serious or you know the government and uh the other private industries that could benefit from it would make uh perhaps more permanent uh exterior fixtures which you know wouldn't be hassle to drive to or carry stuff to you know that that's kind of one of the thoughts that i had about it exactly you know what what they uh oh another thing is that it the industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the universe you know the affects the environment um-hum what they manufacture has got to be and the way it's packaged has got to take that into consideration yeah but like here in Berkeley you can't buy anything from a fast-food place anything like that that's in styrofoam yeah they've switched to that paperboard the pressboard stuff uh and you know it's it's supposedly decomposes i've heard some stories though about that uh the thing that that lasts longest in in in a in a the the uh landfills is not so much the diapers and the things that everyone's yelling about but it's the newspapers is that right yeah and that's really strange you wouldn't think that but whenever you see you know they're usually uh wrapped real tight and bundled and under pressure themselves before they get put into the landfill so yeah inner areas of them are are protected so they don't decompose isn't that something isn't that you know you and all those thousands of trees that gets cut down and you think well geez well newspaper's pretty good because it will you know yeah i saw a sign at the local Wal-Mart here back there in the baby section talking about Wal-Mart does not buy disposable diapers because they don't decompose as rapidly as people say they do so they just buy the ones that don't decompose at all i thought that was interesting indeed well you know there's got to be a fortune in that you know i've got all we've got to do is get together and figure out some way to to use these diapers in some useful product you know some some some huh like like compost well yeah yeah or or or or a compost brick uh you know yeah you know build your next sky rise out of compost brick you know you'd see the little blue things flickering through it but i think that might give it a little added touch of something i'm not sure what oh no but that so they're aware of it in Texas huh they are yeah they're uh like i said we've we've just recently i guess in our part we're like right in the middle of the state and you know we're not more in some of the metropolitan areas like Dallas or Houston or something but that you you are starting to see more big large uh recycling like dumpsters where that makes my heart sore because the last time i was in Texas was on a hunting trip and i was there with a couple of buddies and we had filled up a couple of cans we're going down the road about eighty miles an hour and rolled down the window and just threw them out now oh no you messed with Texas uh i i will have to say that the people i was there with were Texans uh-huh i was visiting it was not my idea well you know they've got these adopt a highway programs they have to give the convicts something to do you know well i i understand that and i think that that that he's certainly contributed to that yeah i'm gonna say i don't typically i want you to know you've taken a big load off my chest i've never been able to to confess that to anyone and now i've gotten to confess it well i'm i'm happy to oblige not happy that you did it but you know well something's got to be done i tell you what i was just watching a a show the other night on on Antarctica uh and how they're wanting to make it a a uh an international park zone so that no one country you know gets down there and trashes it for mining rights or any other thing and um uh yeah it just it just amazes me uh you know that that that there's so little left on this earth where there is that sort of thing and of course the only reason that that place is left is because the damn climate is so inhospitable that no one can live down there you know right right yeah well of course they're they're trying real hard to devise ways to sustain life more comfortably down there just so they can get at some of those resources yeah well they're they're doing it they you know they're they're learning and and it's inevitably doomed and speck you know all they got to do is find one speck of platinum or one speck of gold or uranium and and yeah well there's already oil there isn't there well they not uh not absolutely for sure now there is some off offshore um-hum but as far as on the continent i don't think that anyone drilled a rig on the continent yet yeah but uh in any event huh i think we all just sort of have to hunker down and do something about it but you know it's like we we we have all the needs that you know a civilized society has and i think that it's not all our responsibility to to do that i mean the the the manufacturers would would manufacture things in ways that were biodegradable and did not damage the the the environment you know i think that it would be a plus for them and more people would buy more of those products oh boy there there's such a higher level of consciousness about that now that's that's got to be i mean if you could come up with something like that just to the the marketing advantage would be phenomenal yeah and i think that the people are ready to pay a little extra for that kind of marketing yeah i well i think we've already seen that i mean just in the the this the few products that have uh plugged that is a is an advantage you know it costs more and people have jumped on them yeah yeah well i i know i'm willing i just uh you know it's just i i have certain needs for certain things and uh you know i really can't help it how it is packaged yeah right right and then as soon as something comes along that is that that you need and all of a sudden it's available and in a environmentally i have the need for what's there found ways and i will switch immediately and i think probably the rest of the planet will too conscious package i i tend to agree and it sure would be nice to see something like that well listen it's been a pleasure talking with you Steve right yeah that's right i sure enjoyed it alright well you take care and listen uh the next time you run over a beer can in the road i'll think of you okay bye-bye please do alright bye  do you have any strong feelings about gun control i have pretty strong feelings about it yeah i think that guns ought to be controlled uh i agree there should be some control but uh how strong of uh a control do you think there ought to be well let's see on one to ten i guess i vary i actually started out as a member of the NRA in my youth but having looked at murder statistics in other countries um it's so dramatic that i think that i'm probably down to about a two or a three in terms of control however no i'm sorry maybe up to a nine or a ten uh okay that's yeah okay got the scale going the other way um open the almanac one day and it just has murders of by by guns and you look and you look at European countries and and it's like six eleven four and you get to the US and it's four thousand sure and that tells me something about but if you make owning a a gun a crime only criminals will have guns i've heard that before and that's probably true yeah that that's i mean the other problem is there's so many guns out there if you ban sales of guns right now there'd still be millions and millions and millions of them sure uh but uh would it would really be nice to make it a little harder to get one so that every punk in the world doesn't doesn't pack a rod yeah i agree with that i think that some states are just far too lenient uh Texas and Florida are very easy on uh gun ownership being able to buy guns all it takes is a driver's license yeah and uh sign an affidavit uh saying that you didn't commit any felonies right so i think that ought to be uh tightened up i favor uh uh holding uh the guns say for for seven days or whatever until uh you can check out whether somebody is legitimate or not yeah and i think that might stop some of the uh impulsive crimes but uh things that like that are planned uh selling guns to New York City things of that nature i don't think you're ever going to be able to stop that there's just too much of a demand and people are going to get ahold of guns no matter what the restrictions are yeah i think i think that you're right it would be the pretty much the same problem that that prohibition is in fact pretty much the same problem that drug control is yeah if enough people want it and they're willing to pay for it they'll get it and a lot of people own guns just as a hobby and uh hunters in particular they're they're not uh buying guns to commit any crimes at all just uh uh pursuing their hobby yeah yeah but it it's uh ones uh say the midnight specials uh uh the semi semi automatic weapons uh assault rifles things like that that uh really have no place uh for a sportsman yeah that's certainly true i mean i own a handgun myself i've actually never fired the thing but uh-huh but um but i went out and bought it intending to to learn to use it and so on but i never did yeah i don't see any problem with owning a gun for self protection but uh education is is a big part of that people need to be educated on how to uh how to how to store their weapons uh so the kids can't get at them and so they're not a threat to the rest of the family yeah right right a lot of people don't get that type of education they don't have any kind type of safeguards on their weapons at home yeah i mean i certainly just walked into the store and bought mine and a box of bullets i suppose i could have gone and blown my own brains out or anyone else's who was who was nearby yeah although i must say i have a healthy respect for the thing yeah uh gun control legislation is uh is really tough to beat i mean the NRA is so strong and they lobby uh uh a lot in Congress yeah so uh it's going to be really tough to uh add uh gun control type of laws to what we already have yeah it's um it sort of amazes me that that in the Gulf War people were really concerned about ten or twenty or thirty or a hundred people dying and if a thousand people died in that war it would have been a mess and if five thousand had died it would have been considered a national calamity and yet that many people die uh from gunshot wounds i mean i think that we have our values in a in a sort of in in a funny place sure yeah uh yeah i'll have to agree with that it uh i never really correlated uh those two incidences say crime at home uh versus an international war but uh yeah i guess i don't know how to how to place that yeah i mean in some in some fields we seem to have this really profound respect for human life and in other fields we don't i think guns and automobiles are the two places where we're willing to take our licks but you know we're willing to accept sixty thousand highway deaths a year yeah uh that's that's true uh and uh when it gets to the point where it's unacceptable where the majority of the people find it unacceptable they may find cause to write their Congressman and lobby for some stronger controls yeah but uh yeah we are very tolerant a very tolerant society and uh it takes a great deal of uh abuse before we get our act together yeah in some areas but i think in other areas um i don't know i guess this this this this Gulf War came to mind where where um well war just comes to mind you know couple a hundred people get get blown up and it's and it really shakes the country to it's roots maybe just because of the way it happens right uh-huh and uh but you know we'll go all out uh to save uh a child with a rare disease who makes the newspaper will get millions of dollars in contributions and and all kinds of medical aid because that one life is considered so precious yeah when it's viewed somehow when it's viewed in i don't know as as a single life it becomes very precious and when you view it as a statistic whether it's guns or automobiles or smoking um people just don't see those as individual lives somehow or they don't they don't uh relate to them personally i think it depends on uh who's leading the crusade and how strong they feel about it take for instance Mothers Against Drunk Driving that used to be just a very small organization started by a housewife yeah and now it's a national organization they they're very powerful uh they collect a lot of money yeah yeah and uh it i think it's made an impact i mean it it's made a lot of people cut down on their their drinking and driving because the laws are enforced stronger now yeah it DWI convictions are very serious yeah they are and and it's really changing the social structure of things i know i went out with a bunch of people i don't know six or seven people and we were just sitting around drinking beer and the waitress asked us which one was driving she didn't want to right wasn't going to serve that person anything because uh they're liable anybody who serves anything to anybody is liable can be sued hm yeah i didn't think about that i sort of thought that with guns i think it ought to be the same way i think people who own guns ought to be held responsible for things that happen with those weapons yeah i thought that was the case i mean if uh if my kid grabs my gun and goes and shoots somebody i would really have the feeling that they're going to come banging on my door well i saw a talk show just the other night where uh there was a mother on the show and her uh son had been killed in a neighbor's house by one of the neighbor's handguns huh when only the other kids were at home they apparently had three handguns that were uh in plain sight one on top of the refrigerator one in the on the bedroom dresser and one somewhere else but uh hum just teenagers and uh and grade school kids at home and one of the kids got shot by a gun got killed and apparently no charges were filed against the owner of the gun who happened to be a police officer hum i don't know what that says it's pretty sad so it's i guess they say accidents will happen and uh uh you know it's just hard to say who's at fault for uh things like that that happen yeah but somebody's got to be uh um somebody's got to be held responsible ultimately so i don't know i think the law should be tightened up on on gun ownership but i can't see a total ban on it at all uh because then you're still going to have criminals with guns and it's not going to help uh the situation uh there people want to break the law they're going to do it yeah it's well it's just too late i mean there are countries i've lived in both Japan and England where guns are not available even criminals don't carry them or it's so hard to get and the and the law is so severe for people caught using them that by and large uh they don't well they have a lot tighter controls on importing things of that nature too you can't get them through airports uh yeah yeah you know like in uh Germany in the airports there where there uh where terrorism is so much of a threat uh the uh policemen have uh automatic weapons you know and uh i don't know what the penalties are for trying to smuggle guns into a country like that but i imagine they're quite severe yeah no i think by the by the the the year nineteen hundred there were probably enough guns in the US i mean it's just always been a way of life here the wild wild west right well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home and what are you going to do about that You got two hundred million guns here and it's uh it's more than just an army well yeah that's uh that's a point although uh if that's the case why are we spending all this money on all of this high tech weaponry i wonder well there that's your your professional army uh that's your first line of defense yeah uh that that's for your your mercenary forces that go across overseas and and attack other countries but at at home here right  ready okay uh what what what what exactly we're talking about uh industries trends everything social changes well whatever whatever i guess you want to whether things changed over the last uh twenty years okay all right we'll start twenty years back and come forward how's that sound all right good enough here we go all right well uh let's see i guess some of the some of the things uh civil rights have come a long way i guess in the last twenty years well yeah i think they have i i really do and it's it's no longer the issue it once was and i'm kind of glad least i i hope that's a good sign that uh yeah yeah that's true uh the times have changed uh more to the more equitable at least yeah and i guess i guess uh women's rights have come with that too i guess so that's uh uh yeah i think they have too i don't think women's rights have come as far probably not uh i i think that uh in general women would feel like they still sort of getting the bum deal compared to uh say some of the minority groups um-hum um-hum uh i know my wife would yeah yeah yeah but uh i don't know uh seems like we come uh a long ways in terms of the economies of of things uh if i recall back in the sixties we didn't tend to run a debt all the time but we did run a debt a lot with the great society a lot seventies and so forth that's true yeah and then uh it looked like we just stayed in some sort of a economic economic economic morass ever since that's right what's i guess uh part of that was that uh twenty twenty five years ago Japan wasn't uh hello hello we're there okay that twenty twenty five years ago that Japan wasn't uh wasn't what it is now so that that's probably caused some changes right i can remember yeah i can remember in the late sixties early seventies you couldn't even uh hardly find a Japanese car around um-hum and uh what few there were around were very ugly looking things must've been oh yeah like uh like the old Subarus and uh the old old Datsuns yeah yeah they must've been pretty reliable though because some of them they built up a fairly good following and it appears that's the case do you own any kind of foreign car um-hum uh no we don't as a matter of fact i don't either i've always just uh i don't know whether you call it buy American it's just that i've always bought Fords and i guess i'll just keep buying Fords yeah yeah and uh but uh what else what else has changed oh i guess uh Watergate was in there so i guess politics politics in general has kind of kind of gone downhill uh but well in the last because i can i can remember maybe before Nixon that uh the presidents were really up on a pedestal some of the ethical aspects of political life certainly seem to have gone downhill and certain yeah or else we or else we know about it now one or the other yeah in certain respects i feel like that the uh uh Reagan administration coming right off the Carter administration did tend to bring back a more aggressive uh uh aspect to the human rights issues and the sort of things that democracy in this country has really stood for and and you know and uh brought it back to the limelight compared to the sixties and seventies yeah um-hum and i think that was a positive uh positive thing but it seems like uh uh with all that uh we never seem to be able to get our house in order when it comes to the economic things i i bring this back to that at least uh it seems like we still continue to run uh uh heavy uh indebted indebted budgets and the like i don't see any real way out of it either i might add yeah no no i there's no easy answer that's for sure or else they would've uh done something by now i guess yeah well yeah yeah i think that's true but uh and probably the only other thing i can think of in the last uh oh twenty years or so i guess is that uh family structures have changed a lot yeah i think they have too seems like that uh the country's might been more uh migratory um-hum that's true and family the the old family structure of the mothers and the grandmothers and the grandfathers maybe even some great grandparents occasionally that seems to have been broken apart pretty pretty well including the family structure as a unit itself yeah yeah it doesn't seem the norm to have uh have parents and and uh the two what two point five kids and all that uh yeah well i hope that's not right i do i do hear these statistics same as you do and uh and uh i i i always felt like at least the immediate family unit mother father and children yeah was a cohesive structure that was healthy and was a integral part of what made this country i don't know sort of a stable country in terms of discipline uh uh i don't know some not necessary discipline but certain social order that's it and i i true yeah but it it it's sad that we're we're losing the grandparents and the uncles that that family you know beyond that families don't seem to get close anymore yeah yeah yeah and that's probably got something to do with what you're saying about the migratory yeah in my my family i know most of us are Southerners just happen to be living up in Maryland though but my family uh we're we sort of like our roots and like to get back and have family reunions and all that yeah yeah yeah and i think that may not be the norm for some a lot of people as much as it is for us that don't want to do that i i think you're right i i think that's uh very rare anymore that uh definitely people aren't at family reunions on a regular basis and uh and a lot of them i guess don't do it at all so yeah yeah because i know it's been a long long time since our family ever did anything like that so yeah i must say too it seems like the whole flavor of uh war has changed considerably when you look at back at the Vietnam era that's true and what all we went through there in terms of what's happened in the Iraqi situation it seems like uh we have uh made uh uh uh a a rather uh major about face in terms of the way we conduct war and the way we we uh can technologically uh uh carry out a war um-hum it's it's it's easier to to fight i guess when you can find them i remember that was the the problem back then you just couldn't find them they're a little hard to hide in that desert yeah i mean uh not not well uh then too i think the philosophy is changed i was just reading tonight in the one of the news magazines that you can take you know i i i take Newsweek Time and US News and World World Report all three as a matter of fact uh-huh and uh i was just reading in one of the uh the those news magazines that uh there's a um a movement among certain members of the military establishment the upper hierarchy uh uh uh officer staff to uh change the kind of way we conducted war in the past in terms of uh instead of meeting the enemy the enemy sort of head on instead of doing more feinting and and and and technologically appropriate tactics like these smart bombs and things like that doing more um-hum more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out uh making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things um-hum than uh has been the case in the past where the idea was to meet your enemy sort of head on and the like and i think politically we've changed a lot i think in the Vietnam war um-hum overpower them uh we we Congress got too much involved in in trying to manage the war well it's probably because it lasted so long you know i guess it's yeah and that that's absolutely the wrong way to to go to conduct a war in my opinion when you when you're in a war right or wrong you should let the military establishment handle it and and and give them the job that they're paid and supposedly skilled at doing yeah um-hum and let them get on with it instead of tying their hands which i felt like was not the case in the Vietnam war but was entirely the opposite in the case of the Iraqi war where they more or less gave it to Schwartzkopf and and the rest of the military units and just says hey look handle it and they did um-hum yeah and i think the military proved itself competent to do exactly what it's paid to do and uh it just goes to give me a a a feeling that uh we did some things wrong um-hum i think in the Vietnam era uh and that uh Congress should have stayed out of it much as possible um-hum but uh that i see as a change and then industrially going back uh i i think uh uh industrially we've changed i think we've come through an era of the last thirty years or so twenty ten of a uh a a nation that was industrially oriented towards uh manufacturing type industries and i think now we seeing ourselves transitioning into a more technological electronics age where it's yeah more of a more information processing yeah information and communication and and computers that is really our next industrial revolution and uh you know it wouldn't surprise me the least little bit if we didn't see the whole idea of manufacture of automobiles and the like except to some degree we have to keep a little bit of expertise in the house that being a base export to third world countries and you may find might find even Japan and and uh uh major powers like uh the the British and the central European economies being less and less dependent upon that kind of industry uh because it's uh somewhat labor intensive even if they start robotizing it uh i i i i'm concerned that that would be the case instead the more uh advanced nations would tend to get more computerized more telecommunication oriented and the like and information is is getting to be uh sort of the thing um-hum i i i think i don't know yeah no that's true that's true over the last uh twenty years that's uh that's a definite change and it's only going to only going to get worse i guess in the near future it's going to be more rapid i guess um-hum yeah i i think i i i i think we're made some mistakes too for example i think the education system in this country has not really kept abreast of what's going on industrially um-hum and uh i'll give you an example i was talking about i've said for years because i i my background's in physics and uh i've said for years that the education system in this country has not reacted um-hum to what is the actual uh uh uh industrial evolutionary state of the country and by that i mean when i was going to school you got your basic sciences um-hum and uh that was pretty much about it yeah and uh when i got out of school i had to sort of teach myself everything i've learned uh about computers and programming and and just you know the whole bit hardware in general relative to why you can do things with data acquisition process and the like um-hum and uh when i was going to school you had to have mathematics if you were in engineering or science or any of the other scientific fields chemistry and biology and the like um-hum but you never had to have computers and even to this date in colleges it's not required to take computer courses if you're in in the engineering or the science fields um-hum unless you're a computer scientist or or or someone in that area and then it is required of course because it's part of the curriculum and uh just as we have to take at least a year of English in in in colleges and a year of some sort of social study or electrical engineering probably yeah i think that it should be required in college in a in a uh uh science curriculum i even think in liberal arts this day and time it should be required you have to have a year of some sort of computer um-hum  what's uh well what what kind of cars do you drive do you usually drive right now we i've got a uh four year old Subaru and a two year old Honda oh my goodness well we're we're we're sort of sort of a General Motors family i guess that's the way we were raised and uh uh we were overseas for TI for a number of years and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family oh goodness yeah and four cars and we bought some year old cars from National Car Rental at at least two of them we bought an Olds Calais and a Buick Skylark really uh for you know they each had twenty one thousand miles or something like that and turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that um-hum uh then we've got an eighty six Chevy Spectrum that we bought new my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her uh-huh and we've got a eighty four Toyota that we bought used so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers it's like musical chairs i bet i bet yeah one short and uh but you know it's interesting the two even though my dad uh was a Chevrolet man forever and ever ever and we were in the retail milk business and he had all Chevrolet milk trucks and and we bought automobiles and all that and it was almost like and a Chevrolet dealer was our friend and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a but a Chevrolet it'd be like going and spitting on his grave but uh yep and we got older and got away and then we thought well you know you still could buy General Motors products and it was probably not that bad but uh we lived in Malaysia for TI in nineteen uh eighty one two three and four um-hum and of course you don't buy General Motors products over there but we bought a Volvo and i have never had a car that i've loved more i just can't afford them here uh but i i just loved that car no um-hum and uh we bought a uh we lived in the Philippines for TI in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh Ford Telstar which is somewhat similar to the Taurus it's sold in the in uh the Far Eastern countries Far East countries more um-hum i then here but we really liked that and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you've had well yeah we had uh we had these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves the others were hand-me-downs through the families um-hum yeah and those were always GM cars uh Buicks and Chevrolets and um we were real happy with them but all the ones that we ever had were the you know eight cylinder yeah um-hum oh yeah the big the big yeah really rugged GM cars and all we had heard was was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars and we both drive well forty five miles round trip every day um-hum sure sure and so we wanted a smaller car when we got ready to buy we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage and quite frankly we were afraid of the of the GM small cars yeah um-hum um-hum you know as far as durability so we kind of right when when we had our larger cars we didn't mind um keeping them up you know doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often um-hum yeah but once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them all of them you know it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them yeah yeah it seems that something goes every month yeah exactly and i'm afraid we're gonna be in that in another year with all of ours you know we got three eighty sixes and an eighty four and we'll probably be there with all of them you know it's the same thing you know i don't know whether you uh classify the Skylark and the Calais as small i guess they're intermediates um-hum um-hum uh but uh we went on a family trip to Massachusetts and there were five of us and uh five five of us never go anywhere together here everybody everybody's heading off in their own direction and i rented a Buick Le Sabre right um-hum and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger Impala station wagon from seventy six to eighty and it made all the i i had forgotten what driving a big car was like it's like a yacht it was just nice it floated yeah what we had we sold our our we we traded in our Le Sabre for our Subaru oh yeah yeah it was a great car it just we ran ran the wheels right off of it yeah yeah yeah and and uh you know i've read i'm in the quality business at TI i'm a quality manager and we're we're uh we deal we sell i'm in the semiconductor group and we sell to uh Ford Chrysler and GM uh GM Delco um-hum and there is a amazing i am just uh really impressed with the with the quality consciousness that these those these companies have put into their procurement and it's uh it's come about as a result of the competition from the Japanese um-hum and uh uh i and you know we used to think Ford products were tinny i mean i was growing up i was taught that when i was growing up you know that that that real people bought General Motors products and you know and peons bought Ford products but just with the quality requirements that's right that Ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants and they're really uh uh stressing this partnerships in quality and you know GM and Chrysler are doing that but i really think Ford's got a leadership leadership position in this right now and i think it's showing up in their automobiles their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now um-hum and uh uh we went to uh Austin a while back to a basketball tournament and we were gonna be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down we'd rent one and we went up to the local Budget and we were gonna get a Olds Eighty Eight or something he said i'll tell you what for a dollar a day more i'll give you a Lincoln Towncar um-hum hm and we drove that down and i hated to turn that back in when we got back we had that for three days and i absolutely loved except i wouldn't wanna have to park it in tight places all the time i bet no i wouldn't wanna have to pay for the gas either uh but i absolutely loved that automobile and you know it wasn't that i'd driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going so i knew what i actually got on the trip and it was about twenty four miles a gallon um-hum uh and you know we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it let it float um-hum and it was pretty nice are you are you are you planning on getting any additional or other cars it's a nice car no time soon um we're our our kids we won't have anymore licensed drivers for about thirteen years yes so we um so we don't plan on purchasing anymore anytime soon both of our cars are getting hm oh yeah yours is small um-hum oh around sixty thousand miles on them we drive a lot oh yeah yeah you probably got another another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them uh um-hum we've got probably we'll get something in the next couple years my son will graduate from high school this year and and he's gonna go to Richland College one year behind us um-hum it's right you know in fact our house is adjacent adjacent to the Richland property he wants to go to Texas Tech and he's probably gonna have to go to Richland a year to get some grades in order but uh the next year when he goes out to Tech he wants a pickup a pickup and i want a pickup i may get one and not let him have it but we have been looking at these red Chevrolet they they're very popular around here um-hum these uh red uh red Chevy pickups and uh we'll probably do something like that uh uh incidentally uh uh i don't know uh the uh the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want and you call this number and uh they go negotiate the price for you and and or or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal um-hum and uh my boss just bought a Chevy pickup and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way really yeah and uh uh you know you you figure out the options go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and and tell him what you want and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy a certain person at that dealer's place um-hum so i'm gonna try that the next time i buy one i think that'd be a good idea and and so you know i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own but once uh one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating yeah i've we've yeah we've we've kind of been the types that will say this is what we intend to spend this is the car we want will you sell me this car for that price yeah and for that price and and we've had we with our when we bought our Subaru the guy was like you can't do this to me and we were just like okay fine we we won't then you know and he's like no no no but we'll go somewhere else yeah yeah and uh and i i think that's probably the way you got to do it when when i was young i went in and bought a uh or made a deal on a sixty this is nineteen sixty i'd first come to Texas and made a deal on a sixty red Impala convertible um-hum that i just loved and this guy gave me this deal you know i told how much i wanted to pay and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate um-hum uh we would go ahead and buy uh uh if he could get this rate i promised to buy and i left there on a Saturday afternoon just totally exhausted i i was only twenty five years old or something and i i left there and i um-hum i uh i'd never done this before because i'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from and uh uh so i i got back and a salesman that lived in the apartment i did asked me uh uh if he'd heard i was gonna get a car and asked me what i paid for it he said well hey uh before you go buying anything he says call this friend of mine at Will's Point it was a guy that owned a Chevrolet dealership up there and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up Monday morning um-hum and just driving fifty miles out of town it was a difference and i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars but this was four hundred dollars on only twenty five hundred is all we paid for cars in those days and uh goodness uh so i called back the guy in Dallas and i told him that i'd left him a check for tax title and license and everything and i said i wanna cancel my order and and don't try to cash the check because i'm gonna i've stopped payment on it already and he says oh somebody's taking he said what did you get a deal for Bill and i told him he says somebody's taking you for a ride and i said no somebody took me for a ride last Saturday and uh uh and i i find that uh and for the longest time then i drove up to Will's Point and the and the and the fellow died since then and and some of his relatives taken over the business and but and since then i hadn't really that's right  what's the uh in Texas law has a uh what does it have it has a death penalty doesn't it oh yes yeah they just uh started it again too just late or within the past few years you know for quite some time just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty but now it's coming back into favor uh yes well they find it is more deterrent well my sociology class at SMU's taught us that it was not a deterrent uh but now that's just what they said uh i don't know maybe maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent well uh if you maybe they've changed their minds you know compare the figures i think that's where they're uh they're coming from the uh maybe that's it maybe that's it because that was back in the seventies oh there yes they are that was before the uh uh they adopted the death law again but uh i i myself am in favor of it uh particularly for uh well i think Texas has a good good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen i think i agree but i think it ought to be expanded to include children i i think they're they have they're working on uh something in Austin now uh-huh and i'm not sure what it is i just remember seeing a uh kind of a synopsis of it uh-huh well why stop at children why not go to adults too well uh i'm i'm personally very in favor of it uh-huh uh why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids or tried or tried to or done their very you know given their best effort at doing that uh-huh yep i i don't care to support them well i don't either but uh uh but there is something to be said about or uh uh just just for the sake of argument i'm taking the a con i'm i'm against sure uh you know yourself how many times have you heard where uh uh a citizen was wrongfully arrested uh-huh uh-huh and served time at a penitentiary uh just recently this uh black man served nine years was it and then there was the black woman that uh robbed and shot the furrier for robbery and she was set free too just in two examples in Texas recently uh-huh but she actually killed the furrier or someone she was charged with murder and then then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something i didn't i don't i didn't retain all those facts very well but i know what you're what if we make a mistake that's it and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything uh-huh well right now our laws are so liberal that uh even with the death penalty in effect i don't think that uh they're going to use it uh too frequently uh unfortunately i like you say yes let's have it uh unfortunately i like you say yes let's have it put them all give them all a shot get rid of them well why should they be sitting sitting in uh prison getting their college degree well i guess though where i would have a problem with it if i were on the jury that that put that handed down the death sentence because it was my judgement the person's guilty uh-huh now that's tougher it's easier to say it on the telephone and everyone agree that yeah the death penalty's the way to go it's a deterrent to crime they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway but to be the actual one of the ones that decide that would be tougher for me yes very true i uh i agree with you there uh i think i'd probably do it but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance it that's that's that's a real easy thing to say that oh sure i would but i don't know uh-huh well i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that uh i it it's uh that's an awful lot to uh to expect of a person to uh to kill somebody is what it amounts to well yes but you know that's what they did it true very true but they they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted yeah well uh and they they wanted something worse than they more than they respect the human life uh-huh yeah exactly well anyhow i guess we both agree that that it is it should be in effect hang them yeah yeah i agree it should be in effect also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement uh so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect but i want maybe well i'd i now i have a problem with this too i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance oh that's true well now any uh just believe in just about any state in the union uh uh a death uh or uh yeah death verdict is an automatic uh appeal that's correct it is it is and uh uh yes i'm inclined to agree with you i think so there should be a limit as to the number of appeals now there's some and maybe now i don't remember if this is Texas or not that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence um um well no convicted drug dealers not just for dealing in drugs it uh is it what is what's the rule there are certain circumstances and i don't remember what they are it's something of the distribution they're on the distribution end uh yes they're not selling them they're distributing them it's for the large dealers is what it's reserved for uh-huh and they they are in effect killing people oh oh yes yes i i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs oh okay i think that's the way it's worded is that how it's worded i knew it was there but i i or proposed or is it proposed or is it passed i do believe that's in uh i wouldn't swear to it myself but i thought it i thought it was in effect i believe it is i believe you're right though i think it is and i have to agree with that uh-huh i i think it certainly should be one of the options uh i've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren so far that i know i qualify that heavily because you never know but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet uh-huh but it just touches so many young people oh it does uh i have four sons myself and the youngest is twenty eight so they are all pretty well grown up and they all went through it you know going through high school and everything um and knock wood that uh they have not well i won't say they didn't try it uh i wouldn't know but uh they i doubt very much that they're they're using it now in fact i'm sure they don't well my children are about in the same age bracket i thi nk let's see the oldest is thirty two and the youngest is probably twenty seven twenty eight huh so it's the same age bracket yes and there's four two girls and two boys and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge uh-huh yeah that's usually the way it is it it's just uh try it out with their peers and none of them even smoke they don't uh they never been strangely enough uh their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up now my my my wife my ex-wife she quit uh well when she was pregnant with the last one and she never started up again and i just quit oh about fourteen months and two weeks ago boy that's tough yes it is i and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by my husband hasn't quit yet and he knows he should and he knows and he knows but he hasn't um i do respect the fact though that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me he he's very conscious of of passive smoking and he's concerned about it but well hasn't quite made it yet well when i was still smoking i i felt that way if i was in a public restaurant seated at table with uh non smokers i would try to pick a seat a a my seat where the smoke would blow away from them or i'd hold the cigarette under the table yeah i've seen all of this yeah and uh but uh now i'm on the shoe's on the other foot uh i'm aware of other people smoking now well Charles will actually Charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own um he will get up and he'll go outside you know and he he's so when we're invited to people's house he will not smoke in their house which i think is good because there's a lot of people that are very particularly if they have children yes uh-huh but uh and he's you know he tries his best but the actual quitting he hasn't done he changed brands to a brand he doesn't like he put up all of his ash trays he will not smoke in a comfortable position you know but still he's done everything the Smokers Anonymous tell you to do except quit smoking it's a uh uh-huh it is long process well the there's a trick i use they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment oh how neat and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one one at a time and uh that that's gets to be uh a deterrent he has his in the kitchen  okay Jean um could you tell me what you what you think about uh gun control well i think we have a lot of laws on the books right now that if they were kept and followed would take care of a lot of the problems we have as as far as firearms go or as far as firearms going or is it just uh the pardon yes the gun the gun control gun controls yeah i'm not really all that sure on on uh what the federal regulations are but it seems like each state has their own or at at least that's what my belief is is that each state has their own regulations uh-huh you know some require uh uh a permit and some don't some require waiting periods and some don't um right uh-huh we require permits like if you're going to carry a pistol for protection or for whatever reason you you know have you to have a permit for that right that's that's what it is up here it's like that too you need uh as far as a rifle or anything like that no you can just go out and buy it um uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i i just i just don't feel that uh a stronger restrictions is going to stop a person who really wants to have one for misuse i really don't personally feel that it's going to help no unless it's a like one of those automatic weapons well those we don't need you know i can see there are uh gun collectors that you know go out and collect all these and there are people that go out and fire on ranges and things uh-huh uh-huh um if you want an automatic weapon just for that because you certainly uh-huh don't need it going out hunting no no no um then i think somebody's who's into into shooting though like you say sharpshooters or uh that type of thing wouldn't be so bad but uh yep i yeah i think that should be regulated uh-huh those types of weapons as far as a pistol uh-huh anybody and uh and their uncle can get a pistol anytime they want um uh-huh uh-huh i don't think the laws are going to keep them from getting them if they really want one no no what i i just i really don't believe that what i think should happen is uh any violent crime with a weapon with a with a pistol or or a rifle for that matter uh-huh i think they should prosecute to the fullest extent of the law oh definitely definitely and that's that's what they're not doing now uh-huh that's i say if they would use the laws they have on the books i think it would stop quite a bit of what goes on but they're i don't know it it sometimes seems like they're too lenient with some things but yet if a guy steals a loaf of bread for their family he's in worse trouble than they are right they crucify him yeah um but yeah i don't know if it's i don't know if it's the judicial system like the judges that are too lenient um-hum because there are precedents saying you know well it's uh-huh he really didn't mean to do it it was a fit of anger or or uh he had too much to drink or he was on dope and he didn't know what he was doing uh-huh uh-huh uh i don't really buy that i mean uh-huh if he if he drank too much he knew he drank too much or or if he was on dope he knew he was he was what was going to happen when he when he took it yeah yeah it's kind of a cop out yeah uh-huh but yet i've seen some jury trials where the people feel sorry for the whoever did whatever they did oh you definitely and they and they're lenient they go lenient on them and then after they sit there and i read the paper and i say she you know yeah yeah um i think a lot of people put themselves in the place in the place of the person that has done the crime and they think of how they would react and then they don't think anybody could do the things that this person is accused of doing yep yeah and i think that sometimes colors some of their feelings on uh you're probably right uh a lot of cases too it is um in a fit of anger people do things that they regret for the rest of their life uh-huh uh-huh right right but yet there are also the others that commit crimes over and over and over again and right right they're out on the street after a short sentence uh-huh those are the ones that you know should get the book thrown at them on they should be kept there and overcrowding of course that has a lot to do with i think a lot of times with uh the type of sentence that's given you know what's available for keeping them yeah what let's yeah um i grew up in a rural area and we've always uh we've always hunted i've hunted for years until i got older and then i i just hung my guns up and i just kind of uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you know i'd rather go out with a camera now and and shoot the animals i don't have a my my my husband and my one boy he hunted uh yeah well we we passed a or the town passed an ordinance that it's against the law now to to shoot a firearm off in the town and it's it's still a rural area and it's still farms and orchards and so uh-huh uh-huh and we live right down by next to the reservoir so there's a lot of ducks and you know there's all kinds of wild animals um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and for years it was like a shooting gallery down there uh-huh well some people have no sense at all in shooting to know how far to be away from buildings and that to shoot i mean some of them use no s ense at all right yep yep because we didn't but a neighbor of ours had uh uh a bullet came came through right right through the side of the house and it uh-huh well we've had that happen in our area also um-hum so but since they've done that since they've limited hunting uh-huh it's been uh the birds are back the animals are back it's uh it's peaceful uh-huh uh-huh so our town got together uh-huh so maybe uh communities have to do that if you well i think it depends on the community now we're rural also and our houses are not they're not that close like we have a shooting range across the road from our home but it's far enough away we have fields around it it's a regular oh but and it's it's far enough away from you know houses and yeah that type of thing that uh it's a what is it like a rod and gun club no it's just our own personal oh okay so it's we just have a a personal lot yeah yeah it's for you oh okay now we do have a sportsman's uh club who has a an indoor shooting range and it's very nice our our one boy was a sharpshooter he was interested yeah he was interested in that then uh oh isn't that good yeah did a so what is he does he have to follow certain rules and regulations because he's a uh sharpshooter or uh no not really he doesn't do it now because he's not here he lives in Pittsburgh now and so he he really hasn't been doing too much shooting lately yep but he he really did enjoy it but but he had to have a special permit to carry a gun from place to place um i don't think they had to have not for shooting not for their rifles and that it would be just like uh going hunting you don't need a permit to carry you know you're not allowed to carry them loaded or anything like that oh okay yeah i know right yeah uh so you just need a hunting license no no i don't think so uh the rifles that they use like in their uh uh ROTC now i think they had to they i think they had to do a little bit more when they use them they also had a club at the college here oh okay yep that he shot in and ah okay they had a few more restrictions there yeah so he was probably following whatever the protocol was for the military right right yeah so i kind of agree with you then that uh uh the only the only thing i would like to see them regulate is is the automatic weapons yeah there's no there's really no call for for that that type of weapon but as far as everything else uh if they uh-huh if they followed the rules and regulations and the laws that were already in place i think that uh uh that would suffice we wouldn't have to go any further we wouldn't have to put more regulations out there uh-huh now the lady said they she wanted us to rate from one to ten as to how we felt on a one being uh that's right a a total ban yeah on on ten ten would be no regulations at all let's see no wait how was it yeah right ten was no no restrictions whatsoever and one being was uh okay uh a total ban yeah you know or totally restrictive yeah i kind of think uh probably a six i would go with i would go along with that a happy medium so to speak uh that's yeah i'd like to see them restrict just those like i said before those new automatic weapons but the rest of it i don't think they need anymore uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah okay so i guess we kind of we've solved that problem right i don't know if we solved it but it is a problem and it unfortunately uh i'm not real crazy about guns myself but being from hunting families i tolerate them yeah yeah well that's and i like i like them to learn their safety rules and that and and i think that is good that they have to have a uh now here at least they have a hunter's safety course that the the young people have to take before they're allowed to hunt yes have to take before they ah that's good that is they they have to do that before they can get a license to hunt yeah and any responsible person or any responsible hunter is going to is going to go through some kind of a a course like that um um-hum um-hum  well what what kind of car did you just buy a car or are you in the market to buy a car or actually i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car i've got uh a couple older cars they're both over ten years old uh um-hum and uh they've served me well but i kind of would like to get a more uh gas efficient car and a newer model something looks a little nicer uh-huh yeah uh i've got three children at home two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time um-hum yeah i i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem but no no car was big enough for that well uh i've kind of been leaning towards a Caravan uh-huh uh now i know that that uh they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years but uh i like the Dodge products and uh been uh couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one um-hum uh i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids yeah yeah and uh i think that would that would serve us well plus it's got uh good storage capacity in it for you know taking things along going to the store um-hum which is the one that has modular type seats you know which one i'm talking about they have the commercial on TV where you can you can pull some seats out and you can move around um-hum exactly correct yeah if you want is that is that the Dodge Caravan that does that or yes yeah it uh the Dodge Caravans will do that uh you can take the uh uh usually there's a uh a double seat behind the uh front buckets uh-huh and then if you get the and then there's a three seat that goes or three person seat that goes in the back now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back and the two seats up front or you can take the uh three seat out and just use the two seat or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back uh-huh so it's very versatile you can move the seats all around that's the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat and move it forward yeah uh-huh well the one that i can't remember one it is but it's the if it's the Toyota or or one of the other ones i don't know if it's one of the Americans or the import ones where uh they actually have like um some bucket seats in the back but you can actually pull them out i mean they're really easy to pull out uh-huh um and you can uh move them around and stuff and it it to me that that would be real good for us uh my husband and i uh like to go camping and stuff and right now we have a van which is it's an older van and we're we're thinking about buying another sedan uh-huh um probably next year um right now motorcycles is takes precedence since that that's what my husband really wants right now yeah but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the Honda Accord um that's kind of uh as far as far as the interior it's got the luxury interior but doesn't it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have which is one of the things that we were looking at you know finding something that's that's fairly affordable but yet has all the nice luxury items that we want uh-huh yeah i think that's getting to be kind of important now that uh you know the price is becoming the driving factor and then you look at once you realize how much money you've got to spend then you start looking around at at what you can buy with it where before i think you yeah you looked at the car you wanted and then you looked to see how well you could afford it uh-huh or how you could afford it yeah well i think it's going to be a lot easier now i just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate so i think it's going to be a lot easier to to be able to get a car now and finance it yeah i think banks are going to be a lot more a little bit more lenient yeah i know they're trying to do everything they can to uh end the recession yeah and dropping the prime is probably one of the things i just bought a new house so i got a a uh nine and a half percent interest rate uh-huh not sure i could do much better today but uh that is also effecting buying a new car yeah i can imagine you got to kind of work work that into your budget that balance that and the house payment and of course uh is if you buy a new car you're going to are any of your kids driving age yet well that and there uh two fourteen year olds will be uh fifteen on the fourth of July so are so are they twins yeah they're twins born on the bicentennial you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial is our motto July fourth seventy six oh wow so uh uh i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel of a car so America's safe for another fifteen month uh-huh and uh after that now i may keep the uh one or both of the two cars i i currently have for them to drive you know they're they're they're small enough that a first time driver could handle it yet big enough that i feel safe feel safe that if they were in an accident they would survive uh-huh uh-huh you know what i mean it i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about the Honda they're just well the the Honda's have been have been very safe in in accidents uh more so than a lot of the American cars as a matter of fact i just heard something today on on the news about uh-huh is that right those uh automatic seat belts that are attached to the door um they're questioning the safety of those now uh-huh right saying that and they showed uh a simulation where there were they had a dummy in the car and the door opened and the dummy actually fell out of the car and the car rolled out on top of him jeez so they're saying they're not as safe as they give the appearance of being safe but they're really not as safe as they as they uh appear to be so um i'm kind of concerned about that as far as you know what the seat belts well uh i don't know if Marylan d has a uh a seat belt law but they do have one in Texas and you're you're required to wear them yes definitely the thing is that they're i think it's a two part seat belt though there's the uh door belt and then there's one a lap belt exactly but ninety uh probably about well i don't know about ninety but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it i know my brother doesn 't and he has one in his car then make sure you smack him around then so i mean it it kind of gives you a false sense of security you think oh i've got one portion of my seat belt on um but if your door comes open you know it's not going to do you any good yeah so that that that's a concern of mine as far as uh what i'll be looking at with with buying a new car um i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car the inside where they're normally attached to like behind the door yeah yeah the uh the supports um a good source of information i've found has always been these uh used car manuals uh-huh because you can flip through the used car manuals and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past hum and you can look at the uh the track record on a car over the year and you usually notice uh a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out to where there's fewer problems and you get an idea on how well yeah yeah yeah the the next car's going to be now as long as they aren't changing the model you know like when the uh Pontiac Grand Prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems with the smaller car as long as they aren't yeah yeah the the Le Mans is like that too uh we used to have a Le Mans when i was in in high school um and it was a big car i mean it was like the uh the Grand Prix uh-huh and in i think around nineteen eighty um they changed the model and it like went went to half the size yeah sure literally i mean it got chopped in half and it wasn't even the same car anymore didn't even remotely resemble the old car uh-huh yeah i remember when that happened so unless they're really changing the model um yeah chances are that it's probably going to have the the fewer mistakes than it had the year before yeah well everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a Honda loves them and my husband had a Honda uh-huh uh and it was a lease car and he had to turn back in uh a year and a half ago uh and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it and it was great um and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel the at at the time the residual was like sixty five hundred dollars and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for yeah um a four year old car yeah i agree so so we ended up just went just went ahead and just turned the keys back in and and got out of the lease um one thing that i that i am curious about is um reading information on air bags do some of the vans i think i don't know about the Dodge Caravan but some of the vans now now have um driver side air bags uh-huh which i think is a good idea yeah  okay Kate uh do you play golf um i have played golf in the past i'm not very good at it even though i'm pretty well sports minded um there's something about holding that club in my hand that i want to hold it like a baseball bat uh-huh yeah yeah so i can putt but i have a terrible time driving right that's very similar to me uh-hum i just uh haven't taken the time to learn the fundamentals of the game i just go out and try to be Joe Athlete and think that i can just uh-huh uh-huh you know use transfer skills from like you said softball or baseball sure and i've got that baseball swing and i hook everything viciously so i have to aim like forty five degrees off to the to the right and hopefully it curves back in and usually i end up uh um-hum uh-huh going from one side of the fairway to the other and not straight down the middle yeah yeah like you're supposed to well i even uh took a golf lesson yeah six weeks i guess worth of golf lessons and and i had a terrible time trying to remember uh where your hands are supposed to be and over this way and under that way and keep your legs this way and it was uh-huh extremely difficult considering how easy it looks when the pros do it and so uh i played for a while that way but i can go play Putt Putt Golf really well that's the kind of that's the kind of stuff i can go for yeah uh-huh yeah do you watch golf on TV a lot um i watch some of the things because my father is an avid golf fan he he watches every game he goes out every single day his whole stance uh-huh the way he walks is a golfer's walk if there is such a thing and so he uh he's gotten me interested in it yeah so i have my own putters and and you know some some equipment but um the only thing that i would probably watch is like things that are local like the Byron Nelson Classic that's coming up uh-huh um and then there's another one out let me see off of one twenty one coming up pretty soon so i like to watch things that are close uh by to see if there's any names that are familiar with Texas oh yeah yeah i we don't have a TV so we don't watch much golf uh-huh no i can't imagine watching much golf without a TV yeah so we don't go out to the local uh uh golf course and watch amateurs very often so uh uh but you know when i was younger when i was into it i'd watch it um-hum um-hum every now and then if if baseball or basketball or something else wasn't on and golf was always the uh um-hum the if nothing else is on i'll watch golf yeah because i don't know it's it's pretty it's neat watching i really enjoy watching the highlights like on ESPN Sports Center when they show the great shots and everything i mean that's fun but i don't i'm not up for watching the whole game like i do for baseball or basketball yes yes um-hum right right yeah well at least with now with the with the sports uh and and the TV is um they can get the camera's just at the time the people are starting to swing so it makes it a little bit faster and um a little bit more interesting but i think it's it's more interesting to go out and watch them yeah uh than it is on the TV and and to follow like one or two people along on the golf course and then you you almost feel like you are in doing exactly what they are doing uh it it's so much more interesting i thought than um uh sitting and watching it on TV i think it's kind of boring yeah huh yeah so you've been in the gallery before um-hum uh on the Byron Nelson Classics um was it no it wasn't last year it was the year before so who'd you follow uh gosh i can't even remember you know all those names kind of go together after a while yeah was it like a big name with a big gallery or was it one of the younger pros or something um let me see because i followed several and i'm trying to think who it is that i was um going along with i don't remember now i mean gee whiz i all i remember was we had tornadoes about the same time and that was the big highlight they were afraid they were going to go down through the center of the the the golf course and that's what i remember the most about that uh but i do remember thinking it was a lot different to be out there yeah uh watching than it was to watch it on TV uh watching than it was to watch it on TV yeah well yeah you're outdoors and you know it's kind of neat that's the only thing that's what draws me to golf is just you know being outside on a large wide open space pretty much um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh well down here it's so expensive i'm from Indiana and up there um-hum i i went to Purdue and you have Purdue golf course and if you're a student i mean you can play eighteen holes for like seven bucks oh wow on a really you know it's a big ten championship course so it's really well kept and everything else but you know down here it's it's incredible i've um-hum i've never golfed down here because it's you know nine holes for ten bucks or something and um-hum and by the time i i drill a you know a half dozen balls into a pond or something you know that's that's an extra five bucks right there and so yeah you know it gets kind of expensive for the young college graduate sure sure well i know uh uh since it's warmer weather down here and you can play almost year round then yeah that's the reason is there's so many people who want to get out and go play golf uh-huh see my parents live in Ohio and my dad what he'll do is uh he will come down here or go someplace else in the South to where it's warm so he can continue playing golf i mean this is what an avid golf person does yeah it is just so fascinating and then everything we get for him is all golf junk you know the golf hat the golf you know clock everything because he's he's just he is he is a freak when it comes to golfing golf clock has a subscription to Golf Magazine or something yeah he uh he's he's really something that's funny yeah so uh has he always been like that or just in the later years no see he um it's only been in about the past five years and he's so good we keep telling him he needs to get into some of those senior tournaments and he says oh i can't get in there with Arnold Palmer and all those other good people yeah but i'm saying yes you could you know and then that's where you usually can make a little money and and profit this way uh because his handicap has gotten lower and lower and lower every single year yeah um-hum so uh but no he hasn't gone to do that yet but we wish he would you know make a little mega bucks and pass it along you know to the family well if nothing else just get out there and rub shoulders with the boys that's right i know get to meet all these stars because i remember sitting on his lap when i was a little girl watching golf he has loved golf really all of his life and but i remember watching it golf with him yeah so yeah this is something that uh he can go and see all these people he's uh got to watch on TV for years and years and y ears and years so well that's neat yeah i think so too so uh you don't see you uh taking up you know and charging being the avid golfer in the near future huh no i think some of my brothers are going to do that i'm a volleyball person myself yeah yeah i love volleyball so i'm on a TI league oh volleyball yeah and uh play with a group of people from here at work but i don't even think TI has well they may have a golfing i don't know they may have a golfing club you know it's possible i've never really well Sherman's a smaller plant but i've never really seen a golf club but okay i've seen a golf club that's funny but uh golfing club uh um-hum golfing club yeah there you go i bet you they do but i just you know i hear about things like the tennis the tennis um teams and and uh volleyball and baseball but i haven't heard of golf but i'm sure they probably do uh-huh yeah well i don't know there just not that many places to play around here from what i hear there's a private club maybe one and there's uh uh-huh the local junior college has a golf course because it used to be an Air Force base so they've got the old Air Force base golf course and it's like oh playing on dirt i mean there's no grass so uh you know it's not too many golfers like there are in Dallas probably oh no uh-huh uh um-hum with more courses and more people and probably higher money better kept uh-huh but i don't know i'm i'm just kind of glad my wife's kind of in to it she's she'll play in it about once or twice a year but that's about it yeah yeah yeah me too it's not uh not something like uh that obsession i think my father has well if it's genetic you'd better be careful i know that's true well it was nice talking with you likewise and uh maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime all right take care bye okay okay take care bye-bye  have you run into any problems with invasion of privacy there well what i consider invasion well maybe it's just invasion of my private time is i we get a lot of those computer generated uh telephone calls um where they just you know go through the list and whenever you pick up the phone it's a recording and there you're supposed to hold on for a very important phone call and i feel that if it was so important that they would uh be there instead of putting me on hold oh well that explains that i got one the other day they they did that uh it was a very important phone call from somewhere and they put me on a dead line for oh it must have been minutes and i said well it couldn't have been that important and i wound up hanging up and i've always wondered what that was yeah we uh i don't know why it is but there have been so many of those that um instead of the the sales usual sales calls that you get that they um will just run through the list and i guess wait for someone who's going to hang on to talk to them but uh yeah then we get a lot of those um almost sort of like these TI phone calls no right right no these these are beneficial too too uh for personal uh benefit here so yeah you you don't mind them no most of the people that are looking for me will try to get a hold of me at work that's about the only place they can pin me down um-hum and uh so about any important phone call that i have i'm going to get it at work and if the phone call comes to the house chances are it's either for my wife or one of the girls uh-huh and so i just do not answer the phone call you know i'll let it ring until somebody else answers it and if they say dad it's for you i says what are they selling and i'd say ninety percent of the time if the calls for me at home it's somebody who wants to sell me some oil leases or some right right swamp land in Florida some uh grave sites or something like that yeah we get a lot for uh aluminum siding um and uh but yeah what do you all have what do you consider your invasion of privacy i consider that to be the invasion of privacy particularly when i'm sitting down at the dinner table and they give me a call and i i have to answer this phone to find out they're trying to sell me something and my dinner's getting cold right right that seems to be the prime time they call is is definitely well between uh six and eight o'clock i guess yeah well i think for metropolitan areas they realize that most people work and that that probably the majority of people both husband and wife work and so there's nobody home except maybe school kids after school um-hum right and so they might as well not even try you know not even tie up people dialing phone numbers except in the evening um-hum fortunately they have uh sufficient respect that they don't call after ten o'clock and they don't call before eight o'clock in the morning right i'm surprised they don't though uh i but i'm sure if they did that uh there would be a lot more uh public uh uh voice about it that uh we wouldn't go for that yeah yeah i think if i got a phone call at six o'clock in the morning it was somebody trying to sell me something i would call the phone company immediately and list them as a nuisance call um-hum right and what's so bad about it is um and they don't i mean all it is is they just go through down a list of numbers i mean they don't know who they're calling it didn't seem like uh it they're just a haphazard um uh at it so i don't know yeah but i think that's about the biggest invasion of privacy we have uh there are a few others but uh i presume that they have legitimate purposes right right yeah the government seems to intervene quite a bit uh one of the other complaints i have is uh have you ever checked your credit with the credit bureau uh no not yet you ought to do that it's interesting that to see who has inquired about your uh finances because uh they're required to keep track and for i think about the preceding year uh-huh and it's interesting to see who has uh called and inquire about your credit and there's quite a few companies that uh want to send you credit cards or uh charge cards you know will ask for a uh credit dump and then right send you a letter trying to get you to take their credit card open a charge account with some company that now we've gotten several of those letters as far as trying to um sign us up for you know like you you've been uh approved for a pre you know for a credit card and all this and uh i've always wondered how yeah and uh why now we had a problem not too long ago our uh my brother-in-law recently moved and uh somehow or another we we got their new address on our credit reports because the uh i guess the credit card companies or whatever sort of keep up on some of them and uh had uh picked up the new address and was sending all our bills over there um so it was like okay now wait a second here so it'll be interesting to see how that works out how messed up things will be yeah that takes some paperwork to get straightened out yup so that was a mess but uh yeah it the credit there was a report not too long ago on the news here on uh they were going about how easily it was to get information about anyone and uh you know they got a credit history um you know went through all the moves that they made you know their uh yeah it was just amazing the stuff that they got and it was so easily you know it was all public uh information it seemed like um-hum well there are uh lists that go by zip codes um-hum and uh a lot of companies will target people for specific zip codes because of uh you know if you live in the Elton region or Great Falls area of Fairfax County or Montgomery County in Maryland right uh-huh uh you're a prime candidate to be living in a rich house and uh spend money on foolish things so uh that gets you on a mailing list for Jaguars and Rolls Royces and things like that um-hum yeah we're in one of those counties and uh it uh you get lots of interesting things in the mail in Fort Bend County in southwest Houston the it seems to be the the up grown you know the uh yeah the uh new generation or whatever the up and coming people are all are moving out this direction and uh the new it's funny to see how the different stores are now changing uh to the um um-hum new demands and uh or trying to get the different uh people in yeah and so uh but yeah i do you know you brought a good point about the um credit histories the credit reports that uh i feel is an can be an invasion of privacy if it's used wrong um-hum well there was something on the news just this morning that uh somebody in doing their and uh should be so uh Master's dissertation or something of that nature uh did a study uh-huh of uh credit card reports or or credit reports and they found that something like twenty percent of them have erroneous data in there uh data that would prevent that person from getting a loan in the future or or getting a credit advance and uh the information was erroneous um so uh i i think everybody recommends that uh well they've they the uh story this morning on this radio suggested you ought to do this about once a year but i figure about once every five years is good enough that's right because isn't it uh about fifty dollars to get one oh is it oh okay i was thinking uh maybe i got some wrong information somewhere uh it's about five dollars yeah it's fairly cheap yeah well i had it done just to make sure that there wasn't any wrong information in there everything seemed to be all right right but it it's difficult to change those or or easily to correct though oh well apparent apparently not not if you uh approach the people and and they're they're interested in keeping their records accurate right but uh it's just nice to make sure that no uh uh strange records show up right there was one case i think here recently where some fellow down in Southwestern Virginia uh wound up being arrested for uh failure to provide child support and he didn't have any children and he had a heck of a time convincing the authorities that he wasn't the the party that was responsible for failing to make child support payments oh i bet his wife was like okay come on what are you not telling me here right the second life here oh yeah oh well i enjoyed talking to you and uh uh you i guess have a nice day thank you bye-bye all righty thank you bye  okay i uh i think in general that the the uh one of the biggest change in in uh the role of women in the last two generations is the fact that because of the uh probably the national debt as a matter of fact but the uh impossibility of of uh making ends meat even in a family that which has a two two parent family um-hum but many women work out of the home now um-hum and probably that is the biggest uh change of her role that she now has to um not only be uh mother um nurturer or whatever but she also has to to help earn the earn the income that comes into the home um-hum um-hum and uh and it has oh i i'd agree with you i think that is one of the big big changes right it has uh uh has a lot of effect on a family and it can be positive and it can be very negative um-hum uh and uh i think a lot of the problems that we that we have in in school in education a lot of the problems we have in drugs a lot of the problems we have in in uh uh juvenile delinquency whatever probably can be laid right at that door hum because uh a child who does not have the kind of underpinnings that you can get uh with uh with a parent in the home whether it's the father or the mother um-hum uh it just does not have the same kind of opportunities as the one who does um-hum that's the kind of uh what would it be uh uh calming influence or whatever um-hum uh i think another thing it gives them the feeling of of uh the importance of their position um-hum as a child you know and and course most of their problems come from uh lack of ego yep as opposed to too much ego most of them uh do things because they either want attention or because they they feel that they're not worthy um-hum and so they they do things that they're not not what the the norm would like them to do um-hum so that it is always kind of negative yep what what do you feel about how do you feel about the role of women being a man that make that gives you a different well i mean i i i agree with you substantially i think uh i think getting women because of you know declining standard of living we're not living as well as our parents did or making as much money um and um that was probably to a degree true for them i mean it's no longer the case where um many people can afford to have one parent stay at home and raise the kids or whatever so a lot of people are opting not to have kids or both parents are working and you got to rely on things like day care that's right uh to raise the kids and certainly that's not going to be as stable an environment as uh when you do have a parent at home yeah i think that's probably taking care of them and i i agree with you completely i think that's that's certainly having a lot of effects on our society yeah i think so do do you have children um no i don't no i'm single no um but um the i mean i think that's one of the major things and i think that's had a lot of side effects in the way women get treated in society yeah um i guess one of the things that we can concern ourselves with is is how things are likely to continue to change uh in the immediate future i i think that's probably true i think one of the problems is that that government in their meddling tends to encourage that yeah instead of discourage it instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do yeah um-hum um-hum something satisfying in another area you know i i think there are women who need to do things other than just be a mother but i think that's possible right i mean i don't think that education or anything else starts at school it starts in your head um-hum um and any anyplace you are you can educate be educated i agree with you i agree with you and so it it doesn't mean they have to stop doing all the things that they might want to do and uh and so but um-hum but the environment and i don't think it i don't think it even means that all women necessarily have to stay home and raise kids either you know i mean it should be optional no no nor do they have to stay home all the time right there are lots of ways that they that you can do this but the but the problem is that they have so little choice right well i'd like to see for example more flextime in the workplace i mean i think that would certainly help things yeah yeah i think that's right i think that would be good um a greater acceptance of part-time jobs right and have and have and and if if anybody is going to help them decide about uh about day care or something maybe it needs to be something worked out in uh in uh uh in uh um a workplace um-hum so that they can their children can go there so that they can see them so that they can have this uh you know during lunchtime or whatever um-hum some kind of a better uh contact and more uh a better feeling of of the fact that they are the important thing in this household as opposed to the work um schedule being the important thing in this household yeah i think there's also a lot of interesting side effects to women having taken a more prominent position in the workplace i think it's changed the workplace in in a lot of respects um-hum and uh interestingly enough it also seems to have shortened uh women's life spans so there's i would imagine that's right there's there's something to be said about you know all the stress related kinds of things that that happen when you do have a full time job that's right that's right it's not and and and the the problem is you see that it isn't just the stress of the work but they but they had plenty of stress before uh-huh now they're just doubling their stress and that's and that's really that's right uh really more than you can take sometimes i think that's true that's true i i think that uh um-hum uh there are a lot of really positive things about the changes about uh uh more women going for for uh better educations and uh um-hum all these things i think in uh in a person's life there are a lots of they have more freedom right and there are lots of of stages of your life where you can do things that you didn't do um-hum uh at some other time that uh if you're better prepared you're going to be able to take advantage of those things maybe later or or maybe during sometimes right well i also think there's no longer sort of this predisposition that the woman has to be the caretaker and the upbringer for the children i think that's starting to dissipate right and i think that's good too i mean there's no reason why the father couldn't do it uh yeah that's right i think so too with i i agree with you that i think someone needs to do it that's important someone needs to do it that's the thing we just we just came from our son just graduated from uh from in his Master's degree and his wife is a nurse and he had just graduated in social services work and uh um-hum uh when she went back they just had a a baby in January and when she went back to work she says okay i'll work i'll work five days in two weeks but it has to be the times when he's home um-hum and so that one of them is taking care of this baby all the time but it's a neat thing to watch because he's as adept at it as she is um-hum and and equally as comfortable and i think that is a neat thing it it'll it'll be neat for the children too if you can get a relationship like that but where the where the husband is comfortable right yeah i think i'm doing those things because children badly need more of that yep well i i think it will help the kids be better adjusted when they grow up badly need more of that that's right badly more well hey it's been good to talk to you yeah it's been nice talking to you too yeah all right have a good day um-hum bye-bye you too bye  um i was thinking about the uh the topic you know while they were searching for a person uh-huh uh-huh and uh while i was thinking about it i just flipped on my TV and it was funny because i thought about today how so much of i mean i even my social life is renting movies or sitting at home and you know watching a rented movie or watching a movie on TV uh-huh yeah and just now it's so i mean every everything is just so uh easy that you almost don't have to think of things to do anymore yeah you know what i mean i do and like even even little kids who watch like Sesame Street and everything's really fast paced and they don't have to to sit down and concentrate on one thing for a long time and yeah i mean i remember when i was little my friends uh my parents i'm sorry would just go over people's houses and just sort of you know sit and talk yeah and before TV and all that people would sit and listen to the radio and and that i mean life has just changed and become so much more modernized and uh it's really pretty incredible yeah yeah just the other day i uh some AM station or something had a um like a radio show just like the old days you know it was like from the old days and i was thinking gosh that's i mean because you have to imagine what everybody looks like and you don't understand it until you actually hear it and have to do it and it's i mean you know it's just too bad that everybody has everything fed to them oh really i know uh-huh and you know when you think about oh i was watching reruns of Happy Days the other day and um to think that that was the social life of teenagers to go to uh you know a a place like Arnold's and order a soda pop yeah and uh you know sit and hang out and and you know just the dress codes the whole atmosphere the whole attitude of teenagers and social life was totally different then yeah i mean now we always have to do something new or better or more exciting can't just sit around and talk for awhile you know uh-huh uh-huh i know it's too bad i know and also um i think that it's so much more dangerous for people now yeah i mean before you could go out and and you know you didn't have all the drunk drivers and you didn't have to worry about your kids getting into the wrong crowds and this and that uh-huh and now that's really a problem yeah it really is you know but what what do you do most of the time for social activities um just well i'm fifteen so oh okay oh just a lot of times we do sit around and because like uh i'm really glad that i'm in like uh the classes uh like honors classes and so it's like what's really good about that is that you meet people who really are interested in in talking about things and discussing world issues and uh-huh yes yes it just and it makes me sick to go to school and know people who just that's all they do is like go out and you know try to go find a new guy or something it's just so immature and oh just futile you know uh-huh uh-huh yeah i i definitely agree um are your you can't drive yet then can you no i'll be driving in a few months okay oh in a few months you said oh that's good well you're going to find that driving changes your social life completely yeah yeah i mean suddenly when you're free to go where you want to go it's amazing i mean i don't know if you'll always have a car around that's a different issue yeah but um uh just even being able to go to a movie when you want and and not relying on somebody else it's really pretty nice uh-huh yeah it is but um one thing i love to do and maybe it's just because i like to eat but one of my favorite things to do with friends is just go out and try a new restaurant yeah and uh and i don't know just go and i don't know try like a a new ethnic restaurant you know Indian food or or something like that yeah and i think so often we do social things like you were saying you know going out and picking up guys or or whatever social things that don't really yeah are that aren't really social like when you go to a movie you're not sitting and talking to anybody yeah and when you go to a bar it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody yeah yeah you know um and going out to dinner i think is a nice way you're out you're out of the house um uh-huh i think playing games is something that my friends and i love to do uh-huh we've um we've bought Pictionary you probably know that and i don't know some other games and um and i know this sounds kind of corny but yeah it was it does sound corny but it's so much fun it really is and if you get the right group of friends yeah they have a good attitude about it then you know you can have a pretty good time yeah you really can uh-huh awesome i personally think that i should have been born in the fifties because i do i do love that era and uh yeah and i really think that i could have gotten into i don't know the the music and the lifestyle and um things just seemed so much easier didn't they yeah yeah you know it just seems like you didn't have so much to worry about i know everybody's i mean everybody's always busy and worried and so many problems people don't just sit down and you know just talk and know everything's going to be okay yeah yeah that's true well who knows maybe another maybe the the twenty first century will bring a whole new type of social life yeah yeah things go in cycles you know maybe yeah i get very frustrated when i go over to a friend's house and all they want to do is sit and play computer games oh yeah you know i i don't know if you're familiar with any of them but they're they're fun you know and they're they're you know not bad to like take up some time but they just are so um exclusive uh-huh oh yeah you know you get two people in front of a computer playing a computer game and the the next room could be on fire and they'll never know it you know oh that 's the truth but well it was nice talking to you yeah nice talking to you yeah and gosh i hope you guys cool off down there yeah okay talk to you later bye all righty bye-bye  okay alrighty i think one of the most significant changes that have happened is that they've changed from homemaker to the work market and for several reasons probably some of that is divorce um-hum and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think um-hum um i think sometimes uh leaders in government they've become more uh adroit in that area too instead of just men all the time have more women in government um-hum um-hum and now i'll let you say something well uh i probably a little bit older than you are so what i see um is the change that i see the most is the is that um women have much more many more occupations and careers to choose from than when i went went to college when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary or but there were very few women in business at that time a few but they were the oddity and very limited yes and now i see and and i see for my daughter which is wonderful she's thirteen and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from so many different jobs which i think is terrific because uh-huh yes i'm a teacher and i mean i love teaching but though i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better and um um-hum not that i would give the career up because it's it's a safe career plus because i always have a job plus i am a single parent too and i and i need the income um-hum right but uh and i think that's a reason why a lot of women have have started to work too is because economically it's just a must i think that's right uh you just it's very difficult to get along on one income unless uh the male uh has an extraordinarily good job um-hum and especially men who teach school they don't make that much money and and most all they always either have they're either moonlighting or else their their wife works too right um it's just an economic need now i really think women have so much more responsibility than you know as far as everything oh definitely and like you said um one women today have so many uh the average today of having a a single family you know with the mother as the head is just really um um-hum so commonplace nowadays oh yes exactly we have uh quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents and uh-huh uh the majority is uh married couple with children but still there's a lot more than there used to be and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this when i married i thought i'd be married the rest of my life right right and uh but i'm all i'm really grateful that i went to college my mother always said you know get an education in case you need one because my father died when we were i have a twin sister and we were eleven when he died she had a nursing degree and she was able to make it but she said in just you never know what's going to happen and i thank God that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children um-hum you know isn't that funny uh because the same thing happened to us except i was twelve and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession and was isn't that funny isn't that something yes uh but just that they were able to do it you know and even today i think the chance for education is is so much uh better for all of our girls and and boys too but but the girls especially yes oh yes yeah i do too but i think it needs to continue to change and i mean i think it there's still not equality as far as uh paychecks for men and women i think that the we still have a long way to go a lot of things yeah um-hum and i think that uh uh i think by the year two thousand it we're going to see some a lot more changes uh hopefully that women are you know able to get the the executive jobs and hold positions that men right men do because they can do it just as well you know if they want to dedicate their uh most of their time to that they're they're they can do it yeah and i also think that in the future that uh it's gonna continue that we're not gonna see a lax off of women in the work force i think they're going to stay there and i think that they're gonna hum-um uh be really responsible and and do everything just like what you said you know make make it the grade and and make it so women can be the top people in their in their field exactly exactly and i think that's the way it should be i think it i mean not that i i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i oh i think so could never do strengthwise and so forth but also there's some things women can do like have children that men can't do right right so you know it it i don't want i don't want to be equal but i i want to be i want to get what i deserve and i want to be able to be on the same level with them if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay you know exactly exactly yeah and i just i'm not a women's libber i really am not but i i think that well that we have just as many rights as they do and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then she they should get the job with the same pay that's right and i think that is happening more and more i think it's just gonna take a little bit longer i do too oh i do too definitely definitely well great okay well it was good to talk to you good to talk to you Sally thanks bye-bye all right bye-bye  well i guess you said that you're you're a uh you're engaged so you really don't have a a family budget to manage right now right uh i don't have a family budget but we do have a budget already to we're paying for our own wedding and everything well that's good right oh that's good so you're really planning on uh how to how to manage money from the beginning and that's a a good time to start so uh-huh uh we've been married twenty five years and uh we find that uh you know money management is is really important we uh don't have a lot but we still you know manage it fairly well we don't have a formal budget uh-huh uh we have just found that uh by trying to practice uh paying our bills every month uh especially our credit card accounts uh we don't spend more in a month than what we typically expect to be able to pay at the end of that month uh-huh or when the bill comes we find that that works pretty well for the most part excuse me uh are are you planning on having a a real budget and and setting up a monthly monthly amount to spend or uh i myself i don't do it i've been paying for my own college education also for the past four years so uh uh-huh and my parents also have been married for twenty five years and i kind of picked up what they do they really don't have a formal budget like you do uh-huh and they just pretty much know how much they have coming in you know and they just make sure they don't buy over uh-huh and i'm pretty much like that also i don't buy a lot of luxury items i buy what i need and i buy it when it's on sale you know and i i don't go out of the way but my fiancee now he has a set budget that he goes by and he allots so much to each thing and it works out good for him but uh-huh i think whenever like for the wedding we're doing this you know the wedding money we're doing together and uh we've actually sat down and wrote out how much everything's going to cost and you know making sure we have enough for everything and going from there well now then i guess that's really you know the the idea of budgeting we know you know how much money's going to be coming in and we know what we have to spend so we don't uh you know we don't go out and spend a lot of money that for one thing when we need it for something else uh-huh and uh i guess that's a budget in in a sense it's it's strange i'm an accountant and my wife manages most of the money so you know i manage other people's money but or or you know help them manage their money uh-huh so i kind of let her manage ours and then you know if there's any questions come up you know we discuss it and work things out whatever needs to be worked out uh-huh uh-huh well see uh well like i said he he does computer he's with computer work and i'm a finance manager uh-huh uh-huh but uh we decided that we would kind of share like the books you know uh-huh he he he doesn't like the idea that i would just do all of it and i don't mind you know him helping with it either i think it's just pretty much going to be i think most couples you know it's not yeah it's it's not like one person doesn't know what's in there at any time you know right it yeah you you have to i think that's the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are yeah then there's not ever any you know any question about whether or not the money can be spent or whether it's being spent properly or if one person knows that uh that if both parties know that uh-huh what has to be spent then there's not going to be i've already said that no questions uh-huh and and then plus if there's any uh you know tragedy or anything in the family then both parties are prepared to to take over control of the of the financial situation for themselves if they have to yeah uh-huh it's uh i've seen it uh seen it happen where you know people been married twenty twenty five years and one party or the other managed the the money and you know something happens and the other one was left not knowing what was going on so you really need both of them uh-huh yeah well he's been on his own for probably oh it's been four years now so he is able you know to manage the money uh since we've decided to get married and stuff he hasn't been as carefree with his money like he used to he used to be really carefree with it and uh-huh like i well my my i came from a family we my mom had twelve children and my dad didn't start out as a out as with a high paying job you know so she cut pennies wherever she could yeah you know and i i've learned that from her and and it's really helping out now because in the you know yeah in just in the in a matter of a year and a half we've we've been managed to save it's going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and we're talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half yeah well that's great uh-huh yeah so that's that's pretty good and it's you know it's good that you've got that that uh background of of managing and saving as much as you can with today's economy uh-huh because you know things are so uncertain that you really have to watch you know be prepared to you know to cut spending when you have to yeah but uh you know it's money management's really an important thing you know with today's with the situation the way it is uh-huh uh-huh and i know a a lot of couples starting out uh i don't think they really think about saving any either right you know and uh now i know you know as my mom and dad that's been a big part on them and i think it will be a big part on us also but i know a lot of couples don't even think about it or retirement or you know or in case an accident would occur right yeah most most young young couples starting out think uh well i've got you know forty years before i need to think about retirement so they they plan on waiting you know half of that time and so they wind up uh-huh when they you know twenty years later and they've already reached that point where they're spending everything they're making yeah and they say oh well we have the money we might as well spend it now yeah and they well they they got their uh their lifestyle geared to to spending everything and they can't cut back enough to start saving so uh-huh if you cut back to start with you you know you'll find you'll be surprised at how easy it is to you know if you start off saving and just continue to do that yeah it is really pretty easy i mean myself i'm a college student and i get loans you know i i don't receive grants but i do have loans and just in the matter since uh Christmas uh-huh i've managed to pay about five hundred dollars on my wedding dress myself you know and it it's amazing where you can cut your pennies and you know uh-huh yeah so that's that's real good well any other anything else that we want to talk about on budgeting no i we seem to agree on everything yeah that's that's good every once in a while you find somebody on these conversations that you don't agree with everything have to bite your tongue but uh-huh well i really can't think of anything else on it okay well it's been nice talking to you it's been really nice talking to you too uh-huh bye-bye yeah okay thank you bye-bye  okay hi Norma have you uh taken anything back lately uh that you've bought hi well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants shrubbery that were guaranteed and we had no problem with it we got our money got our money back well why very good good well what do you think that uh consumer goods goods are generally getting better or worse in quality well i believe they're better i do too i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time but i don't i i believe that they're better now than they were i think so i don't think that shoddy not as shoddy electrical appliances i think are pretty good reliable reliable however i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixty three thousand miles on it right and i don't like it very well if when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out at uh on one side oh did you return it no i had moved away no uh-huh i had taken the first one back i didn't think that it heated well enough it never did get anything but just moderately warm took it back and um the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be and i fell for it and uh when i got this one it did a little it heated a little bit warmer and then after one year it started heating only on one side huh so either you or your husband can be warm but not both also i took an iron back after having it only one year oh now i figure that uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron needs to have an iron that will last a long time and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last no huh-uh did they replace it well without even any question but i think it was the store uh-huh Wal-Mart i was going to say it must have been Wal-Mart Wal-Mart yes and uh well well have you been buying any clothes lately any new clothes i haven't bought any new clothes well the last thing i bought was a dress last summer and the buttons turned on it over over the winter the buttons tarnished slightly and i have not gone back about it that was poor quality i think i think it is too and it was an expensive dress i wondered if it weren't expensive and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever yes it was that's right that's what i think too and one belt loop the one um you know like the chain link chain belt loop yes half of it raveled out and that was i believe a Leslie Faye dress and it was the i think over a hundred dollars do you spend that much on your dresses yep i don't usually but i did that one you're really divulging very personal information but i think it should've been better than that for that money is what i mean oh of course i do too well i believe that we've been talking about five minutes and Norma it is just wonderful to talk to you okay i think so good talking to you too i've enjoyed it ah you are a good one to talk about consumer goods because you keep up on it all the time well we'll be talking to you later bye-bye bye-bye  okay so what is your latest home repair well uh we have done some minor repairs we're getting the house ready to sell uh-huh and but i mean i really minor kinds of things you know like painting the painting the the smudge marks and uh uh right gosh we haven't done anything uh real major um did some gardening did some landscaping i don't know that that counts as home repair oh yeah um any kind of upgrade i would guess so i think the last thing we really did was was uh we had some gutters put up um and uh that made a big difference in terms of i mean the water was coming off the roof and just destroying the lawn i we moved here from uh from New England about uh three years ago uh-huh and uh we weren't quite prepared for the kinds of rains that uh you can get down here and uh oh yeah but the gutter the the uh gutters made a big difference how about you and your house didn't have it on there before no it well we bought the house new and uh it was kind of the you know you get what you pay for uh-huh and uh we didn't invest in the gutters at the time huh i figures that was something they put on all houses i don't know no no definitely not in fact we still don't have them in the back yard yeah oh really you kind of have to dig a trench right right yeah i remember i've i've i just got married so i've only lived in an apartment and a duplex so i've you know oh yeah have not owned a home yet yeah but i remember my parents built their home and they had to they had a lot of lot of work in fact it was fifteen years ago and they're still uh trying to finish the basement and up you know it's a never ending process yeah i don't think you yeah that's it i don't think you ever you're ever completely done um i know we had there's a lot of things we would have done if we'd stayed here uh we could use a shed out in the back uh-huh and uh need to build could use the kids could use some shelves in their rooms um but i don't think you know being a new home we wouldn't do any kind of major remodeling like redoing the kitchen or anything like that yeah uh maybe in the new maybe in the new house right the next house uh where are you moving to well we're we're going to stay in the area uh and uh uh we just it it turns out that this house was much bigger and more expensive than than we wanted to to invest in uh-huh and uh so we decided that uh instead of throwing all our money money into the house we'd uh we'd try to invest it a little better and uh that way uh uh uh you know it's it's it's just doesn't make sense to be house poor in these economic times you know what i mean yeah and it's a buyer's market now right it seems to be yeah it seems to be um the interest rates just went down i don't know i would imagine that's going to encourage more people to uh to look to buy a house uh-huh um so uh well see have you ever bought an old house or rented an old house and then fixed it up i never had uh my wife uh parents did that they uh my wife's from New Hampshire uh-huh and they bought this big old farm house which you know didn't even have indoor plumbing kind of thing and uh they converted the barn into a garage and built a couple of rooms above the barn um and uh they did a lot of remodeling in that house and of course had plumbing put in uh-huh and in fact our our first apartment well our second apartment was what they did was they took a corner of the house and converted it into an apartment and my wife's grandfather is just really handy with uh tools and and and as a handyman kind of thing In fact he built his own house from scratch oh cool and and the funny thing about it is you you know you ask him well where did you learn to do that and he says well i read it in a book oh wow and so course course at the time that he lived that's when all the neighbors used to pitch in and help with that kind of thing and so yeah wish it was that way now don't you i do too boy everybody could build each other's house for dirt right yeah that would be uh and and he had it was a really nice house he did a really nice job but he he built an apartment for us huh built the whole kitchen and the whole thing i mean we had a a whole whole uh uh self-contained apartment so uh and it was nice nice i'm going to sneeze in a second i'm going wonder how they're going to uh record that um okay they uh i've been sneezing all day so have you it's uh pollen season i guess yeah but uh what he did was this house is so big that now that he's retired and everything what they do is they have a home in Florida and he completed and they in the Summer when it's just too hot to stay in Florida they go up to New Hampshire and he built himself an apartment in another corner of the house um and he and his uh wife stay up there and then in the winter they go back to Florida and they live in a little trailer home in Florida uh-huh that's always nice to have yeah to know somebody like that oh yeah that can that's handy yeah of course he's he built the shelves in the in the garage for me you ought to have him come down for a visit when you get your new house yeah yeah i'm sure he'd i'm sure he'd love to uh he he's getting a little impatient now because i guess he's uh in his early eighties now and uh he's still you know very active and uh but you know the hand's just not as steady as it used to be uh-huh and drawing those lines they just don't seem to come out as straight as they used to and it frustrates him um i mean this guy i mean i used to think it was amazing when he was in his sixties and seventies he used to climb out on the roof and do stuff and and uh i think if you didn't stop him he'd still do it today um-hum oh i'm looking forward to owning a house or getting a a small house that meets our needs and then fixing it up yeah yeah it's a lot of fun um our first house uh a real small house and uh i i did you know a lot of little things there i put put up my own gutters there and uh the uh being that it was in New England uh it was one of these little houses that was all electric huh and uh and New Hampshire at the time had the highest utility costs in the country um so I was I mean we were just paying incredible bills during the long cold Winters so i had a uh wood stove put in big old wood stove put in in the basement and i built and i uh put in uh registers in the floors and stuff yeah and it was a small house so that wood stove heated up the whole house and yeah my parents have one of those they do and they get really hot oh yeah and uh the nice thing about up there is you know you could buy the wood pretty cheap in fact what you did was during the spring you'd order the wood when it was green and then by wintertime it had dried out and you could use it uh-huh and you could get it really cheap when it was green huh so that was the trick where where where do you live i live in Sherman now i'm from Indiana oh okay so i've lived in Sherman three years yeah work for TI yeah and uh like i said i'm looking forward to maybe buying a house while the interest rate's still cheap and fixing it up right yeah that i think that that's always fun and and you know you can save a lot of money if you buy buy one of these homes that need some fixing up so long as it doesn't have foundation problems yeah and uh you can do a lot of nice stuff seems to be a lot of that you can uh i mean it can really be your home because you've put your touch on it you know uh-huh if that's that's that was the nice thing about having a house built was that you got to pick you know the the floor plan and you got to pick the color of the carpet and and all this kind of stuff yeah but uh yeah that's fun how long did you say you've been married uh not even a year yet oh oh those were the days i've got three kids now oh really and they're getting to the point that's that's that's fun too you know talk about fixing up they're getting to the point where they're old enough to start pitching in yeah and uh and helping with that kind of stuff my parents just got done fixing the house up again because for our wedding you know and then my brother's graduation they finally finished the basement after like living there fifteen years they had an occasion to finish it so oh yeah it was kind of neat to see it finally all come together yeah that's nice i'd started to redo the basement in uh in our house in New Hampshire i was going to make it into like a family room and i'd started putting the flooring in and stuff but i never finished it the uh we got transferred out here uh-huh or actually got i i took the job out here and they moved me out here so uh excuse the buzzer i i couldn't get used to the fact that houses down in Texas don't have basements oh that was the that's the hardest thing for us too because i love like big rec rooms you know and yeah yeah oh yeah my my wife's house in New Hampshire had a pool table that uh-huh  okay Jim um what are they doing down in your uh neck of the woods for recycling we have recently the city of Plano has started a a situation it's pretty much volunteer as far as separating oh paper and bottles and you know cans and that sort of thing yeah and uh it's not exactly curbside yet they've got these little igloo like things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if you want to the biggest thing that they've done is uh for forever we had been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just uh put in uh plastic bags then set out in the alley but uh they came through with these big green uh plastic dumpster kind of things uh where you put everything except lawn trash and then they they we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything only problem is you can't get anything in the paper sack oh that's they're they're too small yeah they're too small on the top and they're they're smaller than most grass catchers and that sort of thing so they just started this uh oh maybe a month or two ago and uh they uh the local folks you know they're just starting to use them now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything we're getting a lot of complaints about them but yeah uh you know i i realize the whole the whole recycling trash thing is a is such a problem because the landfill and all that uh yeah that's true right um i don't know what are they they're probably doing more than that up there i'm i guess you all started this sort of thing long time before we did yeah well up Massachusetts i i live in Rhode Island um-hum and you know i travel back and forth which isn't too far it's only i only live about uh about eight miles from the plant oh so i live right up in the uh in the northeast corner of Rhode Island and and the plant is is in uh is in the like the south uh southwest section of Massachusetts it comes down like kind of a neck so hum yeah i don't have for to travel but i live in a rural community and last year we started recycling they made it mandatory in in our town um-hum and they gave you uh uh little blue containers that you put all your your uh your bottles and cans and like the plastic milk jugs yeah you put those in there and they recycle those and then you put your newspapers in a separate or either you put them in a a paper bag or or you tie them up with string you put those in a separate bundle and they have a special truck that comes around and they pick them up curbside um um-hum and then the rest of it is just you know goes to the landfill i guess or whatever they whatever they incinerate it maybe yeah we uh we're coming to that here you know in the metroplex is getting big enough that um it'll happen i i grew up in a uh kind of a a rural area of of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasn't a problem matter of fact till recently we burned trash you know we had the big barrels out in in the alley oh yeah yeah and when it's filled up you just put a match to it and burned it well course that's that's almost unheard of anymore and that's right that's what we used to do too years ago we used to do the same thing yeah yeah yeah we used to burn leaves and burn grass you know and all that as far as what to uh to do to encourage recycling i guess a lot of states i have noticed on uh on Coke bottles and and whatnot we went i've got some relatives in Iowa and uh there's a big thing up there what is it nickel for every bottle or some such thing and you know people yep yeah we do the same yeah people actively go out and and uh seek them you know i guess that's one way of doing it you know is to make it worthwhile yeah all the states around us Connecticut uh Massachusetts New Hampshire i think Vermont and Maine do it Rhode Island's the only state that doesn't put a nickel deposit on the bottles um but every other state does so you don't you don't see any trash along the sides of the roads people that throw bottles away there's other people that come along with plastic bags and they pick them up and and i guess they can make of a you know it's like working a part-time job um-hum yeah uh it's all free just takes time and if you're retired and have nothing to do um well course there's uh people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down here because it's just uh there's not a per can value on them but there is a oh just on the metal content just in the metal recycling itself i've yeah i i'm not sure what it's what a can is worth now it's couple cents you know you've got to get quite a few of them to really make it worthwhile but yeah to make it worth it yeah it turns out that uh on a a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday night there's enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road to make it worthwhile yeah yeah uh my wife and i both graduated from the University of Rhode Island their uh master gardener program um-hum um-hum i guess every state has has uh uh a land grant college uh would used to be Brown University now it's uh University of Rhode Island um-hum and what we learned down there is that uh fifty percent when you when you mow your lawn fifty percent of all the nutrients are in that top section of the grass and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher and they throw it away um-hum if you if you mow properly and just let it lay in there you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base yeah so that's what we've been doing that for the last couple of years and you don't have to worry about uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so there's more and more people too are aware of that up here yeah and they're not going out for chemicals they're not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so they're letting it you know uh our soil situation down here in this particular area we're in a real hard black gooey gummy awful black clay situation oh so and uh summertimes it cracks when it heats when it gets oh yeah you could lose a small dog in the cracks sometimes oh yeah uh so i i was watching uh i was watching the news this morning uh national news and they were talking about uh i guess they got a a recycling dump for tires that caught on fire um-hum but they were saying that uh California they recycle their their all the tires and make like a a some kind of a rubberized compound and they incorporate that with uh with uh tar and they use it on their roads and they say the roads last a lot longer um-hum yeah there was a thing in the local news here yesterday there's a little town down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield and there's some tire recycling outfit wants a permit down there they say out of every tire you can get a gallon what amounts to a ga llon of diesel fuel and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore there's a couple pounds of stainless steel in most of the uh the tires yeah because the steel belted tires and uh oh for the steel belted that's right i didn't think about yeah it's a totally gas fired operation they say there's no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah tho se burning tire uh see there was what was it Massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it yeah yeah there could be the one up here some place i'm not really sure um yeah over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and they had an awful time putting it out but our big problem down here course is uh tires laying around down on the ground and stuff uh collect water and then of course that becomes mosquito breeding area and uh yeah oh that's right too yeah i didn't think of yeah that can be a real yeah Connecticut was uh is in the process of building a a plant to burn tires to generate electricity um yeah so i guess that's kind of of a a recycling process yeah the uh all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think it's a good idea but the state i think by nineteen ninety three every every town in the state has to go on this recycling program so it's like a forced um-hum yeah um which is good i think yeah what happens to us anyways as you can imagine in Texas you've got urban areas that are probably as compact or as you know densely populated as just about any place in the country but then yeah well you guys got then you run into uh areas you know they've we've got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then you'd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldn't be any people in it yeah Houston's probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island uh yeah uh the panhandle the the there's well there's several counties in west Texas and New Mexico too for that matter that are bigger than Rhode Island but uh yeah we had a our our government rep i'm in DSEG here  yes so what have you painted recently all right oh recently let me think actually recently i've just done some you know touch up types of painting although i'm looking at a few of the ceilings like uh in the family room and uh i'm wondering if i should take that project on myself and that's a little harder uh yeah you know me well so yeah i do most of the painting myself uh you know uh outdoors no you know outdoors uh gets too high with you know have to hire a professional for that um what about you well my kitchen ceiling has needed painting for uh four years now and i'm having painted the apartment that i left in Syracuse i i really hesitate to do ceilings because i get more paint on me than on on the the ceiling but now that they redid the roofs all of our ceilings need it because it popped a lot of nails uh-huh so i think this summer i'm going to take on the kitchen first and then try to do the others because i want to pull up the carpeting and put hardwood all through the house oh okay so i think so that that's a lot of uh yeah you've got your work laid out for you right i figure by by doing it before i put in the carpeting you know the carpet is so bad whatever i spill it's too bad right well that's that's a good idea get get the pointing over with and then the carpet's going to go anyway right right yeah well uh uh i'm thinking for this summer of uh i'm contemplating actually uh doing a lot of wallpaper i think in the basement you know what having a problem of the basement being finished but you know with uh it's being used as a recreation center it's uh it's constantly either a matter of constantly touching up or maybe putting something more durable that i can wipe down and doesn't have to be painted all the time right and so i'm thinking of maybe uh you know if i can find some fairly neutral tasteful wallpapers of maybe just papering and and that has seemed to work pretty well upstairs you know with with kids so it's uh you know it doesn't require that every year the house has to be repainted which usually i guess most people must paint about every two years oh i would hope not because it seems to me that it would get too thick uh and start peeling maybe oh really yeah i i don't know i always assumed i think it's should i don't know my my impression is it's more like four years four years it starts needing it and people usually get around to it at five or six years yeah well yeah i think that's true i mean some of the areas haven't been touched since we moved in six years ago i know exterior paints really if it's done well uh two good coats and a primer uh i think uh exterior paint probably should last somewhere around seven to ten years i think oh exterior that long that would be uh i i thought so you know i would say no less than definitely no less than five i think if your exterior paint is peeling after a year or two then there's probably something going on with the wood uh uh-huh i don't know uh that that's my impression people don't do the outsides as often i know in this neighborhood it seemed like last year everybody was going crazy to have their exterior painted and that was the the first time for most people but that's just trim right uh yeah trim yeah the aluminum doesn't need to be painted but yeah the trim and most people were doing it last year for the first time and that was five years yeah right uh-huh uh course the first original coat was so bad that maybe five years even wouldn't have been necessary if it had been done correctly the first time you know right uh interior i don't know i have known people that every about every two years they they redo their paint and i guess a lot of the the drywall in these houses soaks so much of the paint in oh okay okay and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint um so i'm not i'm not sure two years would be too often i don't want to do it that often i know i was going to say what a mess no no i don't want to it's a that's one of the things i don't enjoy painting that much i guess uh it's okay for a while but i find it gets it gets uh boring or tiring pretty quickly so yeah right right yeah well very good yeah yeah but so small world uh well yeah oh right that's really anyway so uh and then you're pleased with your your jobs once you're done yeah yeah i mean you don't feel you should have paid somebody to do the same job you did anyway no no no not at all i i i think that uh what uh the the work that i've done that's one reason i do it uh if if i really felt that it was going to be a sloppy job and i was sorry you afterward the way it looks i wouldn't attempt to take it on but uh there are a few tricks you know that you learn to use and i've found that uh the one sided paper type of tape that peels off is is just excellent i used to i used to try to edge when as i'd get up toward the ceilings and i found that's really impossible to do but when you use the the one edge paper uh it it really makes a nice neat job You know you let the paint dry for about a half an hour an hour and peel it off and it's a perfect clean line and and i've found that it can also be used uh well like i've gone back and i've painted after wallpaper has been put up around crown moldings and things like that and again the tape really comes in handy you just cover up anything you don't want paint to get on and paint and take it off and sometimes you can even reuse the tape it just peels off like those notepads type of thing but this isn't masking tape no it's not a masking tape it's it's about uh you can get it in different widths i'd say the most narrow is about two inches and it gets about as wide as four inches the glue on it is not across the whole thing it's only across the top much like the yellow pads that you peel off oh uh-huh and it just comes in big rolls and so if you're doing you don't want to get paint on the ceiling for example say you want the ceiling a different color you roll this tape all along the length of the room you paint right up against it you can even get it on the tape itself and then whenever the paint is dry most interior paints seem like they're dry within a a half an hour an hour you just peel this tape off and it's enough that enough glue or whatever is on it that it it stays while you're painting but it doesn't do any damage to paint or wallpaper that's underneath it oh great so it's really good uh you know i've put it up along the uh well i've had borders up near the ceiling in the living room i've put the tape along there and then painted the crown molding and it didn't didn't do any damage to the wallpaper uh-huh oh great uh so that's you know so i think there are a few little things uh different size brushes good brushes i guess a lot of people make the mistake i've found good brushes make a big difference do you ever use these pads uh i pad the paint on oh i've had yes i've used those and i like those actually they cover a lot more area yeah and they're not as you don't get drips as well you can get drips you have to be a little careful but they hold quite a bit of paint so i found you're not constantly dipping like with a brush right yeah right and uh it goes on very nice and evenly like sometimes with brushes you can sort of see streaks if you get it too thick and you don't have splatters like with a roller yeah um-hum um-hum so i do i do like those and sometimes i guess if you're good at it you could uh you could use it to inch up towards ceilings and things like that although i've never been that good at doing that i've found that the tape works best for me right now even with tape i think i was just thinking of using the pads instead of a brush but for ceilings i did try it and and uh i got a lot of paint on the kitchen table i was trying to to just patch the the kitchen ceiling there yeah and so i have to learn how to use pads but i have a friend in Syracuse who who paints everything with pads and she does ceilings oh is that right uh-huh so i'm going to have to ask her what the trick is she'll probably say hire me to come down and do it yeah yeah yeah well i don't yeah that's right i don't i don't know i guess maybe the trick with the pads on the ceiling is that you have to put a minimal amount of paint on there you probably aren't going to be able to cover as much of a surface as you would if you're doing it on a wall because if it drips you can just sort of smooth it all out uh right and i haven't tried that but that's an idea because i find that ceilings are really difficult in terms of how you have to be positioned to do them and your arms are up so it's tiring uh right right that's why i want to do the kitchen first i figure i can stand on the kitchen table yeah that's true uh so have you been happy with the painting that you've done or do you wish that you you had hired a professional or no i i'm happy with it but i just don't do it very often or very much because it's so time consuming and because i am tend to be a perfectionist about it right and you know what i figure is first i have to scrub the walls yeah yeah and i mean if you hire a painter they don't do that just right what does scrubbing is that just is that to get smudges off so they no to  well um i don't have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you uh not at all in fact i'm graduating from college in about a week and this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials oh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do um i think i think uh the system the system right now you know should you know is fine i think it should be by a jury i don't think the judge should have i mean he's just there kind of like the referee um-hum um-hum uh i don't i don't even think that it should be unanimous either um well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees um-hum then there shouldn't be any reasonable doubt but if there are some people who don't agree right exactly um then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people uh-huh um i don't know i uh you you rarely hear you hear of course there's cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison uh falsely accused but uh more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what they're doing um i mean you really have you served on a jury never i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite they say they're uh remarkably incompetent and uh don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that huh well you would think that they would get that in the uh when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and i i i know they automatically when you go through uh when you're chosen is you're automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that that you're automatically no they don't want you on the jury right in other words they don't want anyone with experience anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system exactly uh-huh exactly uh and they tend and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it i mean you know it's it's anyone can get out of jury just about and uh so it it's um it's not really my peers that if i were arrested let's say i were arrested falsely or not um-hum and put up for a jury i wouldn't feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers i'd be i mean i'd be tried by a jury of you know people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and uh i don't know i i get a little bit nervous about it and uh um-hum i've i've never i've never even been called to jury duty yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didn't i didn't make any noise about it i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so i'm pretty sure i didn't um yeah i um i don't know i think the i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system yeah well i i i don't know i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because um you know there's the classic sort of To Kill A Mockingbird kind of story where you get you know jury which um-hum can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isn't supposed to have though of course they can too um-hum and um it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat you know browbeat the jury a majority in the of the a majority of the jury that's hard to say um um-hum so it's it's uh you know saying well look we don't like the way he looks and let's uh let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff right and you also get a lot of um juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert wist witness testimony and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh oh i don't know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim and uh or or uh if it's a corporation that was uh you know harming harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know it's just a big faceless company corporation let's let's make them pay as much as possible things like that um-hum so not i i mean i'm the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be on things like that right i um i uh i don't i i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone least with the jury you have twelve people you know yeah um-hum that are gonna decide you know you're the the person's fate well how about having a jury jury and a judge work together on it somehow i wonder if that's possible i guess the judge's time is worth too much though uh exactly i was talking about judge they pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together right exactly probably yeah yeah but um no it's it's sad though that um that the people though that you you somebody's life is in twelve people's hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less um-hum um-hum and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that they're you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want oh of course it's it's political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic they're not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror that's going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you know exactly um i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually i mean i know it it it's tricky because i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well i'm too busy to serve on a jury so i'll tell them that and they won't uh-huh or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know they just say do you believe in such and such um oh yeah well i guess it's just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then they'd want to be on that jury right course they'd be they would be barred but but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously um-hum and um i mean something you have to do yeah well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury i i hope we're called up before too long yeah i would love to be called i'm ready to go they j ust haven't called me up yet they will they will eventually okay well it was nice talking with you it was nice talking to you bye-bye bye-bye  all right well tell me all about your reunion planning well we uh uh this will be uh uh the reunion for not my grandfather but my great grandfather and then my great and then my grandfathers so it's a couple of generations um and these were pioneers who came across the plains uh-huh and uh the families were are quite large and so we've had we spent a lot of time trying to gather up uh names and addresses of all the tons of people that are involved uh-huh and so it takes a lot of time and planning um good activity the what are you going to do it over a weekend are you going to do it over a weekend or well interesting enough we're going to we're going to do it over an eight day period uh-huh uh they will not everyone won't be there for the whole time but the families can come in during that eight day time and kind of meet on the on the living family level right like i will come there kind of early and my brothers and sisters and their families will come so that we can get acquainted and then uh it goes back the the generation before will join us and they may meet kind of individually in this camping area uh-huh and then uh toward the end of the week there will be two specific days when we honor these two uh uh groups my the grandfathers and the great grandfathers uh-huh uh so it's kind of once more combining the whole group again but uh it's it's it's uh it requires a lot of uh logistics for food for the people who will have to meet uh-huh and a lot of uh arranging for activities what are some of the activities uh well uh course you want to do some kinds of things that which will help them to get to know the ancestor that you're honoring um-hum but besides that if you have a lot of children and and different ages you need to try to find things that uh that they will just have like to do together so that the next time somebody says reunion they won't run like the four winds yeah yeah so it has to be pretty fun too i think uh we're we're going uh going to Utah to uh uh place near Park City uh-huh and uh and it's a a pretty good size area where there'll be hiking and and then there will be uh oh just uh general kinds of things like uh swimming and whatever during the uh in the area roundabout which they will do during the days when they want to when they're not uh uh rehearsing or whatever for a part of the the play and then we'll kind of get together and and uh work out some small oh vignettes or or uh acts or things like that Musical numbers and the fact that we're together early during the week will help us to get together to prepare those things for the for the programs at the end of the week yeah so it it we're real excited about it now always before we have only had my grandfather's family and uh we only did it for one day uh-huh and uh the last time we doing we were doing it every two years and we decided last time we would wait a third year because it came across so often that it was kind of hard to get there and uh yeah some people come from Back East and course i come from Texas so there's some of us come from quite a ways yeah uh and so we we had a little longer and decided to try to hold it uh in a situation that was a little longer like a camping situation something that wasn't too expensive but uh could be more of a vacation situation for families to come and participate in while getting to know their ancestors and relatives um-hum uh so that maybe they'd be attracted more to bring their families now i've never gotten all my family to come before but this year i have uh several married daughters and and sons whose families are coming en masse so it it it looks to be a lot more interesting activity this is what how did you pick uh the place in Utah is it central location or well uh the ancestors came from there okay and uh and we we were holding them there because there were some living ancestors up until uh fairly recently at this point in that generation that we're honoring there's only well my mother is ninety three and she won't go this year because it's just too hard on her but uh and there's one other wife but all of the all of the children are now gone they they've passed away in the meantime uh-huh and so uh at that point we were going for that reason we were going there but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we're but you know if you if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there uh-huh also we had a we had a a the member who was in charge of it in general this time had some access to this park which was a big factor uh whether we'll be able to do it there again but there are other kind of arrangements like in in uh in some of the areas in Colorado you know where they ski in the winter time you can make some pretty good arrangements for uh for group uh activities and things like that how so we might do something like that also sometimes universities will will rent out uh areas for doing things like that yeah okay how long in advance did you set the date but uh well we knew generally the time of year uh that we wanted to do it in three years ago but we could not set the date until the first of January this year because this park where they have it uh they allow people in the vicinity to make their arrangements ahead of time and so we kind of had to take what was left uh-huh and uh so we we feel pretty fortunate to have gotten in at all but uh yeah uh i think you need to plan on you need to be sure and plan uh at least a year ahead of time or you're going to lose people you know they have to plan their vacations that far ahead a little bit right if not exactly at least know generally what they're going to do okay well it's kind of important to to know quite a while ahead of time uh the last time we had one uh i was in charge of it and my goal was to write a history of my of my father and his brothers and sisters uh-huh there was a history of his father and mother but there was no history on them so i spent the two years before that compiling and and writing the history and then we gave it out at that this year we're not we're we're combining it in the and the parents before and so we're going to do some um uh acting out of of these groups and try to help them get better acquainted and mostly it's a different kind of thing so we're we're just kind of playing it by ear and seeing how it goes i think wow sounds like you guys are uh your family's really into family but yeah we're kind of like we kind of uh well we like each other and we liked our families and so we figure they the little kids ought to get to know each other and and we are scattered enough there i have several children who live here but i also have children in in uh Nevada and Arizona uh-huh so it's it's really neat to be able to get acquainted get around with them you know wow and you're younger yes you have any family at all uh well i'm married and uh my wife is from a large family but my family my mother's uh-huh living and she has one brother that has no children that's living and my deceased father has one sister that has one child with and no other children so i have like four relatives not very many huh do you do you enjoy your do you enjoy your your wife's large family though not very many no it too it's it was a large transition let me tell you because they had to meet one person they only had to meet me and i had to probably meet twenty five or thirty people was it is it yeah yeah so getting names and faces and jobs and where they live and everything straight was a quite a task uh yeah i i still kind of balk at it because they're really into family too and like you don't feel quite involved huh well they try to involve me and if i allow myself to be involved you know i'll fit into the picture but uh they uh they make a big deal out of everything yeah well you have to try it you'll like it yeah uh i guess so uh it really is quite a lot of fun and uh um uh yeah uh i'm just not used to it because our family has a reunion about once ever two years and and it's about a yeah you know ten people show up so no one there's my age so i just kind of sit there and hang out but uh Carla has a lot of cousins yeah yeah yeah that are our age and you know so we get yeah cousins get really get really close sometimes almost closer than brothers and sisters sometimes it's yeah it seems that happened with their family especially right especially if they live fairly close together so they get a chance to see each other right it's kind of special yeah there family was pretty well centralized everyone kind of stayed around the the uh the grandparents um uh-huh for at least for a while at least while they were growing up yeah now they've kind of moved out a little bit but not too much yeah so  okay what did you buy okay a Ford Explorer a a Ford Explorer i'm sorry what oh really yeah one of the new ones yeah and um i'd i'd probably buy another this is the first American vehicle i've owned so i would probably purchase another one uh-huh um i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from but as far as uh the quality seems to be there um it's quiet it's it handles well um yeah but i believe i'd get that or a Porsche one of the two oh really no not um if i had the money i think i would love to own a a BMW and why would that be i don't know i from what or either that or Mercedes just because they're put together so well it seems like they last forever what's wrong with the Volvo oh i don't know they're they're not as nice looking oh oh uh meant to me i don't know i'm sure there are some that are but everyone i've seen is kind of plain but what what what city are you calling from Sherman oh where're you i'm Dallas um Dallas yeah BMW or Mercedes yeah well that's uh that's um if i had money um had the money i mean that's just i know i never would own one but uh i don't know i like my actual favorite cars is were uh like the Ford Thunderbirds of nineteen eighty five i really like that style body style um-hum but i don't own one of those neither what do you presently drive um Mercury Topaz um fun cheap taste cheap taste in cars okay well there nothing wrong with those uh yeah they're all right it's it's a good car i mean i've never had any problem with it they're they're nice vehicles they're nice vehicles nothing wrong with those it um it's just everybody has their own taste but man the Mercedes are expensive my wife has a Volvo and it it's nice i mean you know it's okay an sorry i roped on Volvos then huh sorry i roped on Volvos then oh no no no no no no no it it i i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the GL rather than the DL but because they it is the safest car on the road um oh yeah oh is it see i don't much about them i guess yeah they're the safest that's the reason why we mainly got it we got white and it's the safest four door and it's good for if you have a family which we do we just we just dominated everyone out and so it's it's uh um yeah you know they're kind of low to the ground after driving the Explorer you know i presently i used to have a two eighty Z and i'm a tall guy and and uh they're hard to get around in traffic to see because you can't see a car ahead of you but they're fast as lightning and all that crap but the Explorer i mean you're sitting up on top of everything and you can really see real well and i just it's it's so comfortable and really uh-huh and uh so you're what are your feelings about American versus European cars um i like anything besides Japanese course everything has Japanese parts in them anymore i don't like Japanese cars but uh why not European i don't have have any i mean those are the kind i usually end up liking the most American cars a lot of people say they they don't last long but i've never had any problem with um my Mercury or my Cougar my husband has a uh Cougar and he's never had any problem with it either so i don't know that's the way it goes i guess well what are your i guess this is your first time to buy American so yeah i was real hesitant but it was yeah i don't know uh i mean i think European cars are great course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff and they're easy some some of them are easy to work on a Volvo being a four cylinder is very easy to work on uh excellent warranty i mean just unbelievable warranty really and and uh course Ford isn't too bad i think Chrysler would probably make a good vehicle uh but all of it has to do in my opinion with the service and the attitude of the service of the dealership yeah yeah i wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from Middlekauff Ford there's Middlekauff Ford in Plano where okay their just their attitude is just slimy and and uh i've written a a letter to Middlekauff and i've told them that matter of fact i got another letter last night from the Quality Ford Division they're still concerned about my attitude and it it will never change about that place and uh but uh anyway that's my own personal comment i guess but yeah this girl that works for me just bought a car down there and she they they had a problem with they uh took their Camaro in to get it traded and they they hadn't signed any papers and they had all ready uh taken it in to paint it and everything and everything was stolen out of it and the people um wouldn't reimburse reimburse them for anything Middlekauff wouldn't she needs to find herself a lawyer she'd she'd come out like a champ on that one yeah so i've heard some stuff about them but um so have have you been using well anyway what that was i was asking you some questions about the telephone and how long and how many have you been doing but that's they they don't want to hear that but oh just just about a week is that all a week yeah yeah good Lord i think i started in January or February oh God i've i'm like twenty some phone calls so really oh wow that's why i i wasn't sure if this was the second time around or what well look i've enjoyed speaking with you yeah you too and keep smiling okay thanks bye bye bye  okay yes we do have pollution in Houston and it how bad is it do you have smog like they do in California well it it some i think it depends on uh you know what the how the cloud cover and like right now it's uh it's kind of overcast you know just it's hot and the sun is trying tries to shine through but it it's it's holding in this this pollution and i i think so and uh we have uh uh-huh hm depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion i take yeah Pasadena Texas which is sort of between here and you know heading toward Galveston i mean it's still part it's part of the Houston metropolitan um-hum um-hum what do you think is your primary cause of it well i think it's industry and i think it's cars i you do you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas i don't i well maybe not but it it sure it sure seems you know it i i know that when i'm when i'm behind a car and uh sometimes uh i can really smell especially diesel and things like that you know comes right in um-hum to my air conditioner and you know my head and my face i'm so stopped up right now i don't know if it's uh if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that that's part of it but um hm my goodness um-hum i think a lot of it's industrial i also think uh that uh there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles but it's mostly from older automobiles i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting uh frankly i think that uh um-hum i think that um uh if uh i i i heard a story a while back something effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent or take all the cars off of the road that have been uh manufactured say before nineteen seventy five that they could cut the automobile pollution by over fifty percent just by getting rid of those cars that are still left remaining um-hum you mean uh fifty percent pollution total from that comes from yeah from from cars that is not from not total but just from cars okay oh uh-huh so that i think would be a tremendous help and i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical and it just keeps getting uh gives me good service and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have um-hum um-hum but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies and uh that may be part of the problem also right well do y'all have pollution in your country part of the country uh from industry yeah yeah yeah oh uh yeah it's it's uh pretty heavy up here i think but i think it's mostly industrial is what i really uh believe is the the main problem and and uh and uh uh people uh i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should i i we we seem to have a high uh cancer rate up here in Maryland really like what kind any particular kind or just all kinds yeah and uh well uh for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant and uh i think of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody but uh this this this state was like uh second my wife's a registered nurse and i think this state was like second this year from the top in terms of uh cancer rate for just all kinds and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is but i just can't believe this now we have a lot of pollution being caused by chlorofluorocarbons uh fluorocarbons hum which is the like freon twelve and freon twenty two they use freon twenty two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer um-hum um-hum and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also and having all kinds of effects and well what can we do about the the the the air conditioning problem well they're working now i know DuPont and Dow and several other chemical companies are working uh feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons and whoever does is gonna make a a mint because if they ever come up with a reasonable um-hum working agent in place of fluorocarbons then uh is that also what's in uh hairspray aerosol well they used to be but they made them take it out of that even uh so so the aerosol is still aerosol but it doesn't have anything that's damaging right no they they they made passed a law and made them take fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers um-hum well that's good and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem uh uh just trying to i think be careful uh with the way you handle garbage i notice in this state i don't know if you're doing it in Texas yet or not but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces uh you know containers in yeah here they've just started started doing that it's it's you know you're not you don't have to but most you know i i know i am i save yeah well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too but they uh in one of the counties here they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid and she spot checks people's trash and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash they'll fine you fifty bucks i think the first time and two fifty the second time no kidding you really oh is that right well we need to do something we need to get serious about it yeah you right you got to give people incentives and surprisingly enough just handling of trash uh can cut pollution uh from uh uh from just throwing it in a dump or or or or whatever else they used to do with it maybe used to burn it they've stopped that up here too um-hum but that that will cut pollution too because you get a lot of out gassing from these things i think decaying and trying and trying to for instance cans and bottles they never go away at all um-hum well on on the other had i don't guess they're polluting but plastic containers and the like uh they may be ah i'm not sure of that how much does uh planting more trees and things like that help oh i think that's very important to do i i really think that uh trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very very important thing and uh that can help to cut pollution i guess some i i don't know how much i have too um-hum trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air i would hope that they would help some though that's for sure well i think uh it seems like there was something going on around around here that you know we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kinds of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that um um-hum um-hum somebody found out you know like in the middle of the night they would go ahead and do it anyway i think they got caught but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff you know goes on oh good well that uh that i think may go on a lot and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said somebody happened to stay up late night or something i don't think we have a adequate policing uh especially particularly on industry uh we have good policing at least in this state and and uh several of the surrounding states and probably yours too of car pollutants because we have to go down uh once a year here in Maryland and get our car's exhaust systems checked for emissions content well we have to uh we have to have a state inspection every year do y'all have that so which i i don't i would assume um-hum uh no we don't have a state inspection but anytime you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state so i'm i'm assuming that you know they check they check everything for safety or i don't know uh it that's something that you'd have to just chec k with your authorities but in this state we have to uh pay eight dollars and a half and go to a an emission station once a year and get everyone of our cars checked that are have been made starting in nineteen seventy three but that's all they check for they don't check how good your if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough or no no we don't have inspections like that now i'm in Maryland in Virginia they check that every two years i think we do that every every year and i think that's a good idea too not not not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily necessarily but i think it's a good idea the emissions check though is required in Maryland and it's also required in Virginia uh a sister state to to this and that's that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants well i'll have to check i'm not sure if if our state inspection every once a year has to do you know if they check the um-hum well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get along with it they'll get around to it and if they don't then that's something i would certainly certainly uh uh suggest you'd be willing to uh um be for in terms of uh yeah yeah uh emissions oh i would i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or or or anything on that oh yeah i i agree now that's another area we hadn't even discussed and that is water pollution and various of the other types of uh of uh like food pollution i mean you you hardly ever hear hear anybody say anything about food pollution but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this country so uh hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of uh pollutants in our food but water pollution uh i've worried uh especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like i know a lot more people are going to bottled water um-hum well and that's not necessarily the answer either because they found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap so yeah tap yeah but a lot of these uh some of this well you know a lot of people have well water in fact in this area too and you know and uh um-hum if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what your what your drinking on i know i know a lot of people you know have that and you know you have to wonder if that you know it could have an adverse effect on them too if they don't if they don't get it checked yeah yeah i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course have it checked because it seems uh when i was a kid growing up down south uh i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were and we had a well with one of those draws that i forget what you call those things and and that was some of the best tasting water i mean i can still to this day taste that water um-hum when we were when i was growing up i lived in Huntsville Alabama and their water supply came from uh yeah spring and it was like ice cold spring water and i guess parts of the the city still have you know get that but uh that was that was really wonderful it was really really good uh-huh huh oh i bet it was yeah the it once it's been filtered and if it's a deep enough well filtered through all the earth and everything i think that uh it depends of course where you are a good well though i think is very healthy  so child care your views uh well we only have one child right now and another one on the way and right now i'm i'm home with her during the day i if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find if i was close to home relatives or people with the same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as as parents and what religious faith uh Latter Day Saints oh so that's that's good that's what i would try to do with a teaching background i've um had a little bit of experience with some of the child day care type situations but i've seen some good ones and i've seen some really bad ones uh they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they uh-huh and everything in between yeah because there's in most states there's nothing to regulate them and so and whenever they are they seem to regulate the good toward the bad instead of bad toward the good right by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they uh kind of uh eliminate a lot of the uh better situations yeah the the uh what am i trying to think of that not the imagination but the creativity in in the situation and so yeah yeah that's that that's very well phrased uh so have you ever used outside child care no i haven't we've had like people come in and babysit for an hour or two but i've never had um real day care right she's she's not even a year yet so uh we haven't been in you know a lot of need yet our step daughter's ten now uh-huh and most of the day care has been provide for by Grandma yeah i like that situation that's usually real good but quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up the pass of Woodland Park uh-huh there was uh ex school teacher that uh did a small amount of before school and and after school you know kindergartners or half-dayers uh-huh in her home and they would read and play have a relative structured a structured seem to be activities and not just you know stick them in a corner and say you're on your own uh yeah and uh despite our beliefs she was uh one of the more um charismatic Christian faiths uh-huh and it worked out wonderfully yeah i know that um that i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that uh i don't know if the resources are the proper term you know just the the know knowledge of who's a available then you could probably find some really good care uh yeah but i don't know that it would be state approved that's true you can get somebody somebody willing to babysit but actual you know that's sometimes different on a done on a different scale i have even considered you know babysitting myself i have a teaching degree and uh thought well you know i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to but i think if you take more than three children in well that was how it was this Virginia we've recently moved here to Texas but in Virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed i now i don't know what the current Texas laws are but i but i do know that the license doesn't seem to guarantee quality yeah a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel file for it just like a business you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't uh now here i believe that child care meets by and large certain standards for uh balanced food if they provide food cleanliness and levels of supervision uh-huh levels being defined as number of of working adults for number of children uh-huh but that's uh kind of a minimum there that you're getting your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children you know like the educational activities the supervised play and so forth yeah uh my wife is uh agnostic and i'm a backsliding Presbyterian i like that term and uh yet i really believe that this charismatic care or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care or semi charismatic i might say uh-huh uh-huh was quite good yeah it was a good influence for your daughter uh yes very well that's good and and uh the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child uh-huh yeah a little bit of love and and attention is what most of them need you know even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program and and and not have any care right and and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself and so and i'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se you know what i'm saying well even educated play uh supervised play can teach without and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or or or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills and uh you know like my my child that she want be an only child for long but you know she was an only child or maybe your daughter not having yeah proper interface yeah just it's just just correct ness of of social skills if you will uh-huh right those basic things that uh they would that you know maybe a little bit of uh i don't know if manners is a is a good term or not but you know dealing with other through uh proper mannerisms and politeness and so forth you know that sort of thing you'd want your child to learn that from been experience with i mean someone else certainly you wouldn't want your child's day care person to yell at them and scream at them and say do this do that you know you'd want them to promote politeness and niceness you know the things that you would want any child to learn and usually that's done through example not you know an actual sit down learn situation so uh yeah uh it's a very broad issue uh-huh it is and you know it's a shame but most people doing child care earn almost no money they operate at you know um the owner of the child of a you know we're talking large child care facility now we're not talking somebody that does six kids in their home or or three or or whatever uh-huh uh-huh who really doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it you mean somebody that has an actual establishment right yeah their employees earn almost nothing yeah i know i i did that for summer so i can i can vouch for that and and that's really a a shame too because do you and your husband both work no just he does i'm i'm here during the day with her well that's wonderful if if you can make it that way well we we decided to live with a uh uh lesser budget so that we have that that's more important to us you know as as uh there may come a time when i will be working again you know but right now that's what we've chosen and we wanted to have several we got her and we've got another on the way and well like i said may have another one soon after that so that's grand if if you can pull it off right but more and more we're being forced into a situation we as Americans are being forced into a situation where you've got to have  and uh what part of Virginia um uh i live down in the south western part of Blacksburg Blacksburg okay i've been uh-huh have you ever heard of Virginia Tech sounds vaguely familiar VPI yeah okay yeah okay that's yeah i i hadn't been down in that part of the state really uh-huh okay so well we vacation a lot how about you quite frequently uh i wish we did well retired early so we're we take trips pretty often oh okay where all you guys go well we go to Maine every Fall um-hum then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast um-hum and i have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico so we go out there and we go to Florida huh and down oh we were just out recently at the outer banks of North Carolina all these places that i've never been is that right where do you go um what type of vacation well it really depends i mean uh seems like i do a lot in the Midwest lately um my um fiancee's family's from Wisconsin uh-huh and so we've been out there a couple of times and um i uh went to Purdue for a couple of years so i've gone up to Indianapolis on occasion to visit friends uh-huh and um uh i'm a real big baseball fan so i usually try to combine it with uh catching a couple of games somewhere uh-huh what club do you follow i'm uh i'm a big Red Sox fan but uh i uh oh you're you're a Red Sox fan too red sounds good me too yeah uh-huh uh i usually try to catch whoever's in town though i don't specifically i you know go to Cleveland to see them play the Red the Indians play the Red Sox uh-huh um uh that's about it we don't i mean we do a lot of little trips around here um and um ever go up in Pennsylvania in the mountains or not that much we've gone out to um uh a place in western Pennsylvania called Falling Water uh oh have you ever heard of it i've heard of it i've never been there yeah it's it's really neat it's this house built on on a waterfall and it's uh really cool um of course we keep picking crummy weather to go out there uh the first time we went out there was uh the day after hurricane Hugo had come through uh-huh oh gee so i mean they they didn't have any power and it was really cold and and rainy and uh we went up about a year later and it was better but not a whole lot better uh-huh so um where else did we go um we've gone to Richland last year and uh had a good time down there oh did you did you go down to Williamsburg have you been down there um my girlfriend has with her sisters but i haven't been down there um i hear that's nice we're going to get down probably down Norfork sometime this Summer just to see why catch a baseball game actually uh-huh uh-huh we were down well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due Norfork and spent a night there with a friend in Portsmith and then went to Williamsburg and spent a night hum spend a day and a lot of money yeah yeah i've heard uh i'm not real interested in Williamsburg because of the of the price attached to it we just we i yeah but it's a pretty neat town to just go and walk around if you like to walk it's a good town to just walk in hum yeah we all do that you can go to the buildings and not go in if you're not oh okay so i can wander around without yeah you can wander it's a good town to wander in oh okay i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings that's right oh okay i didn't know that yeah i think um you know they do the whole with you know paying a ridiculous amount of money to get get into one thing or another but they had a good time so yeah we didn't do that really this time we just uh visited around um we've done it a couple of times and that's enough for us probably another twenty years um-hum yeah i was um we use it live in California and um my um up up around San Francisco and um there was one year when my father was uh my father's company was starting to to do stuff down in Los Angeles so my father was working down in Los Angeles for like um six months or so um actually i think it was closer i think to a full year and you know we'd he'd fly down there on Mondays and fly back on Fridays well any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles so i saw i went to Disneyland about five times in one year and i really have no great urge to go back now oh that's great as a kid though isn't it i mean oh it was great because uh well the times that were really fun were when uh we had vacation but the kids in Los Angeles didn't so we basically had run of the park um uh-huh right Disneyland i mean there's still a lot of people at Disneyland but there was another um another amusement park down there Busch Gardens um there was nobody there when we were there we got we won a log floating ride like five straight times we just get get done with them and they go oh do you want to go again and we'd say sure have you ever you've never been down to Epcot at Florida and Disney no i'd like to sometime but that's good we we really enjoy that we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter yeah i've never been the farthest south i've been on the East Coast is Charlotte so i um keep wanting to get south further you know i thought i would go to Florida a couple summers ago but never did it oh uh-huh Charleston is a really nice place to visit my um my sister lives in Charlotte and they've gone to Charleston a couple of times and had a real good time uh-huh yeah it's a real pretty place um yeah one of these days we'll get down there although i don't know when we're going to have vacation to do it we're um we're planning getting married in about a year and our honeymoon we're going up to this um oh are you um place in Wisconsin called Door County it's up by Green Bay it's a place my girlfriend's also wanted to go and um uh-huh or is it on uh one of the lakes it's um uh i don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin but there's kind of like a little a little thing sticking out uh in the Lake Michigan that's Door County uh-huh oh okay that would yeah that would be really nice so yeah they call it the Cape Cod of the uh the Midwest so um oh we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun she um she had this uh book of pictures from it that were really nice kind of like a travel guide uh-huh uh-huh sounds good so um that that should be a lot of fun well i don't know what our next trip will be i guess our next well i know what my next trip i'm going to be a grandmother in July ooh oh boy the first the first one so my next trip is going to be to Texas oh that'll be fun yeah in the middle in the middle of the summer well yeah you won't even notice it though well they'll be air-conditioning anyway so yeah is that is that how you got into this uh this you know uh on the data base yeah my daughter's working as a temp at Texas Instruments and working on this project oh okay yeah i was i was just i mean most of the people i've talk to are from are from Texas so when i you know when i heard you were from Virginia i was like oh okay there's somebody different and you said oh i got somebody down in Texas i go okay that the connection right there uh-huh that's it yeah i talked to one in California i never asked him the other day how he was connected i don't think he was TI employee um i um most people talk to Texas there's been a couple of other the people um most of whom are like me that work in in speech labs that are going to use data base eventually oh i see so um it was fun i actually yesterday i ended up talking to somebody else from the same lab i'm in is that right well we spent last week end in Charlotte with real good friends that had just moved to back East from Oklahoma and she's uh working on this project too i mean she's talking ooh um-hum on the project too and uh we got back Monday and i got a call yesterday and it was her on TI Network um-hum uh that's neat i haven't uh i haven't had something like that happen just uh just getting the one guy from the lab uh-huh um you're sure have a nice town uh my uh sister lives on Lake Norman oh does she yeah that's nice out there just yeah um we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer and it's never really works out uh-huh yeah it's real pretty yeah well traffic not much else we do for vacation really uh just so we don't haven't been able to take really any are you a golfer no me either no no are you guys golfers or no huh-uh nope oh not too much into sports except our outside though just walking that's all oh i don't think there are any trying to think if there are any minor league teams down in that area and i'm know real sure there are um no professionals when um i was thinking i might be minor league but oh there's one in Salem Salem Rebels yeah Salem Rebels hum Buccaneers oh okay Buccaneers yeah um yeah i maybe seeing them um in a town just west of here Frederick has a um has a minor league team that plays in the same league with Salem and uh i think we may be seeing them this weekend oh is that right up there in Frederick uh-huh yeah i think they're out of town yeah um that's a nice little town actually Frederick um i've never been up there i've never visited Baltimore i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime oh there's there's some nice things in Baltimore you know the Inner Harbor and the uh the Aquarium and all that are very nice um they've just done a um you known i you know the Aquarium is one of those things that you know because everybody uh-huh  okay uh where do you stand on gun control was a loud one i'm against it again your a one then uh-huh uh-huh i i uh your against gun control why why yes you you can't enforce the laws you got why do you want to pass some more that's a good that's a very good point very good point i personally i guess i would be a five they said pick a one to ten uh-huh uh because i i'm i think i'm dead smack in the middle i think that if there is going to be a ban on gun control that it should be enforced like you said and i feel like if there if if there is a band put upon us it wouldn't be a forced enforced just like um there's suppose to be working on a drug problem suppose be working on our education problems uh-huh things like that and those aren't being enforced but at the same time i want to see people protect themselves because things like the drug the drug war is not is not helping and i feel like i have to protect myself when i go out somewhere because there's so many people they're crazy people out there that's correct i don't know how maybe that's i agree one hundred percent i just uh what irritates me i guess is that they keep wanting to pass gun control laws that do nothing but take away your your constitutional amendments you know and so uh-huh and that is that is really not gun control is not the problem uh-huh it's the people using the guns exactly and all they're doing is look at this new Brady Bill uh-huh the seven day waiting period that does not deter anybody who really that wants to buy a gun uh-huh right there's spots here in Austin uh-huh on Sixth Street to Eleventh east east of the interstate uh-huh and you stand in an alley down there and buy anything you want wow i mean you know and uh-huh whether you want guns drugs women anything uh uh-huh yeah it's just it's just like the drugs i mean they're legal yeah but you can get them anywhere if you want you can get it true you can make two phone calls if you know if you know anybody here in town uh you can make two phone calls and have automatic weapons uh that is a shame the law's just you know it's they can't enforce what they have you know and i'm not a big fan of Peter Jennings peculiarly uh-huh uh-huh but he was on one of the on the talk shows one time they had Kennedy on there and Brady Mrs Gonzalez and some of the other liberals but you know uh-huh and he he pulled this big stack of papers out that was about oh four feet tall and he said these are all the current gun laws you have the books if you can't enforce these why do you think you can pass another one and enforce it exactly exactly but uh the Brady Bill won't do anything but just make it harder for the people that are honest to buy one those those that are criminals which are the ones that are refusing guns in the first place uh they're not going to walk in and buy one anyway the reason i think i'm so cloudy on the issue is because i mean it it i want to protect myself but at the same time i don't want anyone to have a gun that could harm me you know what i'm saying well uh the uh proper solution is education of the masses and so uh-huh uh-huh you've got to educate the people in in using the weapons uh-huh exactly and you know our forefathers you know everybody carried a gun here in Texas uh-huh you know for you know a couple of hundred years right but everyone weren't they weren't going around killing each other that's true unless of course there was you know trouble yeah sufficient sufficient provocation which we have basically the same something now it's just that all the honest people you know the citizens as it were no longer carry guns to defend themselves because only only the criminals are but do you think more and more people now are carrying guns and weapons oh yeah i mean just to i'm talking about the regular like oh yeah uh i have a class license Joe Blow on the street uh-huh for firearms and a friend of mine owns a gun shop in uh-huh uh-huh and i go up and help him you know work in the store and stuff like that and it it's amazing the number of people that are buying guns and the reason they're buying them is they want to give their wife one to carry in the car with them right and that some of the woman will come in and they'll look around and they'll try and find a small one to fit inside their purse right uh-huh i mean you you have to because i i mean i don't have a gun it just scares me to have one but i feel like that very soon i'm going to have to get one just because i would probably feel safer and well if you get one you know right now i have a knife under the seat in my car uh if i'm going anywhere at night anywhere i mean if i'm just stepping outside my door i carry something on me if i'm you know going up to my door and i don't have anything i put my keys in some kind of weapon like position in my hand you know you're single i take it i'm sorry are you single i take it yes yes i am i have a boyfriend but you know he's not always around yeah okay yeah well my wife uh before we got married uh she didn't carry any sort of thing and uh uh-huh i i've got uh i've acquired you know her you know bought several that i give her to carry one of them she carries in her purse uh-huh and there's some in the car i i always have one in my truck when i'm driving any place yes my boyfriend that that got me you know put the knives here and there and you know just different things and you know knives or mace or something but uh you know yeah and i have mace on my key chain i mean i have a lot of you know little things that but i don't i don't like to have to carry them you know uh but you have to well it's a sad state of affairs when have to but uh you know they're are more and more homes getting broken into and everybody says well yeah uh-huh uh it's because of guns no it's not because of the guns it's because of the people and and actually they're breaking in no no that's right to the homes and and using weapons to buy drugs although you do have those that you know like the idiot who ran out and grabbed that AK-47 and shot everybody up at the McDonald's in Calif ornia that's right uh-huh uh-huh now that's just you know that we're talking about somebody whose crazy having a gun law is not going to stop him because he's going to find one lunacy that's yeah he'll find some other way whether it's a gun or bomb or what and uh yeah well you know California California Hawaii and New York state have these and uh now New Jersey had the stiffest gun laws oh do they oh yeah but you know where where are the most crimes committed New York state yeah as you know uh John Lennon was you know you know was shot and killed uh-huh in uh New York by a guy that bought a gun in Hawaii which has a tough gun law uh uh uh and you know i mean this clown out in uh California he uh had a criminal record you know a mile long and still got a gun but he still had not one but several uh-huh and there was one not too long ago but in the last six months uh he shot up that Allstate or or or that GMC credit place in Florida right uh-huh well he went out and bought six different guns uh you know and he had a criminal record and i mean if you find if you offer a uh enough money to somebody they'll go get you a gun you know if your not eligible you know come to me offer me enough money i'll go get you a gun you know there's probably a lot of people like that oh yeah and there are people yeah they're people doing that so i mean the the solution is not to pass more laws than you can't enforce because they're they're going to pass one now they're trying too either the Staggers Bill or the Brady Bill yeah uh-huh um-hum either way they do it it's going to cost you and me more money right and not probably going to help too much because and and and we're going to increase the bureaucracy that's supposed to handle it and what are they going to do they're going to punch your name in the computer and you're going to come up as no you're not a criminal and no and no you have no criminal record you know and yeah you can by gun uh-huh but that doesn't say that you're not going to walk outside and three days later shoot somebody exactly you know there's no substitute for people a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know it's their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before oh yeah actually guns are not the prime uh weapon used in killing people in crimes of passion or whatever uh-huh it's knives and baseball bats uh-huh baseball bats yeah i didn't know that oh yeah i could see knives yeah stabbings and things see you can walk down the street carrying a baseball bat and nobody thinks anything about it uh-huh you know and how many times have you seen people walking down the street carrying a baseball bat uh-huh you figure what little leaguers on their way to practice yeah they could be gang members just as easy if you i didn't know baseball bats was like that oh yeah it's uh it's quite a deal uh nobody pays attention to a baseball bat uh-huh you know and you you can see a baseball bat in the back of the car and nobody no cops going to give you a ticket for a baseball bat in the back of your car that's a very deadly weapon yeah so why you know i mean one blow at that and yeah or knives you can have knives everybody's got knives of course you're limited you know you can't have switchblades and stuff uh-huh uh-huh but uh uh you know guns are used but so is everything else uh-huh if you're going to ban that if you're going to band guns i've got an article in the Wall Street Journal where they had where they had uh used a satire where someone in New York had suggested all the guns because they were used for commission of drug regulated crimes uh-huh and they immediately decided well lets start banning the public telephones bless you i'm sorry and they said well let's band the public telephones too because the public telephones are used in the commission of drug related crimes very true makes about as much sense a lot of sense but you know the to my way of thinking you know uh i'm a i'm you know i spilled blood on the ground you know for in the United States uh um-hum and uh if if the United States does not trust me enough to have a gun after that then i don't trust them enough to govern me right right but i'm kind of radical on that i just you know you sound like you're pretty strongly well i i see too much of it and i see people come into the shop up there and you know and i buy guns and and they haven't got the faintest idea what you are doing yeah you know and they want to buy a gun now i think there should be some sort of ID card that you carry right what do you think about making some kind of application or something there's an application you fill out now do you okay it's a yellow form uh-huh but uh see that's it's just another piece of paperwork it asks for your name your address and phone number and the county where you birth and all and you know and then there's a list of ten questions you answer and if you answer no to all of them that means you're a good American you such um seriously and yeah uh uh uh it's a little yellow form you fill out and it puts the name and the serial number the gun who bought it and the date like that and that stays in the gun shop and it never goes anywhere it stays right there we've got boxes full in the back room uh well that's a lot of help and and the only thing that it's used for is if uh if Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms come down and does an inspection uh-huh they look through and if they look through and if they look through your legal logbook you have to log it down in and out well you got and they probably really do that and they and they don't come out very often uh-huh i've seen them once in about five years oh my goodness but they come down once  are do you work outside the home uh yes i do full time and do you have small children no i don't have any children oh okay no huh-uh i uh i also work outside the home full time um-hum i i do have small children though oh my gosh it makes it does make it very difficult i think that um our culture has um broadened quite a bit so that it is very acceptable for a woman to do so uh-huh and um do you think it's gotten easier on you personally you know as far as at work uh you know other people how you interact it's gotten easier on you um well yeah yeah but i didn't i i never found it difficult uh-huh as a woman my i'm i'm in the medical field and so i don't i i'm not in a field that is typically a man's field i'm not a surgeon i'm not a doctor um oh uh-huh right and so i i haven't um oh breached anybody's confidence on i haven't tried in you know going into a man's yeah yeah right yeah yeah i'm an engineer what is typically a man's role are you in a are you in a job that and so so i have i have uh uh problem even when i was going through school yes you are you're challenged frequently yeah i found it to be a man's world and i got a lot of static from that yeah it it my and it my first few years at TI i found it to really be hard but now that i've been there for a while it's it's kind of a deal you have to prove yourself and after i've been there for a while now you know the guys i'm just kind of one of the guys i'm um you know respected and and and i do the same things they do um-hum i'm sure not necessarily sure i get the pay the same pay but i'm pretty sure i do and and i feel a lot better about it i have a friend that had just turned forty five um-hum that's an engineer and she tells me horror stories oh i'm sure of what it use to be like you know you know always getting um um-hum belligerent comments like you ought to be at home having babies instead of doing these blueprints and things like that things that would just make her cry at work but she couldn't cry in front of them because they'd do it more you know so she's yeah she you know builds me up and says be a strong woman and and present yourself professionally and you know builds my confidence quite a bit um-hum so that's why i ask you that if if you thought maybe times his changed made it easier on you at at work uh for me personally i don't think that um my sex really has much to do with um with limiting me as a matter of fact my um employer wanted a female for my position um-hum um-hum i do have trouble um i'm a physician assistant which is uh-huh somewhere between a nurse and a doctor right and i um frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them uh-huh and it is a it's not uncommon that the um it's it's typically Hispanic males typically Hispanic males do not want me to be their medical you know provider their their medical care provider that day uh-huh they um they really have a problem with it and they'll and they will almost always ask me to see the doctor that is so strange well not not when you think of their culture though yeah and their culture i i'm talking about the ones who came from Mexico not the ones that were reared in the states right i'm talking primarily about um you know the the guys that are over here on work thesis uh-huh uh-huh you know that sort of thing but their culture is still very much thought not a woman's thing and i'm a blonde and and and they are just like you know who is this girl why is she in here telling me anything uh-huh yeah yeah yeah this little young girl yeah yeah so they um so that's that's that's the only place i've ever even had a problem um-hum regarding my sex sometimes my size is one limitation because i assist in surgery too uh-huh sometimes i wish i were strong as a man but um or the average man anyway yeah well let me ask you this how have um did children do you feel like children set you back or kind of went off track a little while you know this is this is women's an issue i'm on a women's subcommittee women's initiative subcommittee and we were discussing this last week matter of fact um-hum um-hum that certain women have taken career kind of jobs you know and and decided to go in and have one or two children and then got back on track and they didn't see that as a setback but i don't i don't i don't see how i can ever get back on track i don't see that as being a possibility i will i will never work uh-huh in other words if you wouldn't of had seventy hour weeks again oh yeah that's what they were saying before they had children they were working like crazy people i mean i don't i yeah seventy hour weeks every week i mean it was nothing i mean that was what i did every week and but i don't not only uh-huh i mean i can't any longer my husband works a full time job outside the home too right and not only i mean i i physically cannot do it because of day care et cetera uh-huh uh-huh but i don't want to the desire is not there right yeah um and i am not someone i i i didn't i didn't think i had the desire to be a mother even uh-huh right and yet the childre n had transformed me and and and the mothering has transformed me to the point i don't if if something happened and i no longer had a job uh-huh i'd be okay i don't even think i would go interview again yeah i i you know it's it's i mean i love what i do but i love my children so much more yeah and there's there is a guilt that goes along with leaving them to in the hands of other people right right that aren't you and a fear there's a fear there too i'm not really afraid of what might be happening happening to them um-hum in an in an abuse issue but i'm afraid of what they're missing i'm afraid of what yeah yeah right of of what's not being uh you know uh discussed discussed with them or what or what opportunities are missed that i could fill in yeah so that fear's there yeah yeah yeah i i hear that uh there's all men in my group i'm i'm one of two women the secretary is a woman and these men a lot of them have uh small children either just one or or two you know babies because we're all fairly young and and i hear the men saying that a lot you know and i think that is a culture change that you know their lives have changed since they had children yeah you know they don't want to work that sixty hours anymore they want to hurry up and get home you know i can't wait to get home so i can play with my son right see the kids so and they have the same concerns as not necessary an abuse guilt but you know thinking well you know if i i could spend more time then they could learn so much more you know just just learn about me i mean learn what i want them to be learn the things that are truly important to me because if you just tell them it doesn't count yeah yeah um-hum right it's what they see routinely that they remember right it's that they see routinely that you deal with the you know with the gardener in a in a nice manner uh-huh uh that they see routinely that you are um you know doing Bible study or prayer group or whatever you are yeah uh-huh they need to see that instead of you just telling them well after you go to bed at night i uh you know stuff envelopes envelopes for the Crippled Children's Association you know that doesn't count they need to see what it is you spend your time and your energy doing yeah yeah yeah yeah in order to get part of you otherwise they grow up with parts of their child care or there care givers that's right their nannies and you know right day cares that's really interesting um-hum yeah yeah it's it's it's a tough thing i don't if you if you have children you know yeah i was going to say if uh when i get to that point i'm sure i'll know it i see it from day-to-day like i say the the men are experiencing this um-hum you know a lot of them one of them just had a child within the last year and he has totally changed from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes God i'm ready get out of here you know i need to go to day care it's incredible it's and he routinely calls the day care during the day you know like can i talk to my daughter you know and and uh it is the most life changing experience i have ever ever i mean i i had no idea i never even wanted children yeah and uh then we were blessed with one in an expected fashion and i mean i just i i can't believe it i mean i i can't believe this is me uh-huh yeah and neither can anybody else you know i mean but it's just phenomenal that'll it is absolutely phenomenal that'll me too and my family they'll go oh my God you've got children are you fixing to have a child they won't believe it they'll pass  all right have you ever been drug tested um that's a good question um i had a job i had to go get a blood test for uh-huh um and they and they did a full blood screen on me but they didn't call that a drug test so that i think they checked for drugs they just don't tell you they did yeah i had i've had uh two or three drug tests that i had to get before i could start working at a job uh-huh uh different jobs i had one at TI and then one at another engineering company and really i mean i don't mind them i don't do drugs anyway i guess if i did maybe i would but um i don't know i know a girl that she's a nurse and they get drug tested randomly i've never been randomly drug tested uh-huh but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it yeah well i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about yeah i guess so i guess so do you think that it's right well uh uh i i come from kind of a biased opinion because i'm a a therapist and a drug and alcohol counselor uh-huh and i've done employee assistant work and i i know the the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents on the job right that are specifically drug and alcohol related and it's like in the billions of dollars every year right um and the the only way that they can prevent that is is you know making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free that's true and you know the the problem in the work place is that that people are like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever i mean you can come to come to work drunk and get in an accident and he'll cover up for you and nobody knows about it but could you know ends up costing the company lots and lots of money right that's true so you know there i believe it's right especially for certain jobs i think anyone in a in a public job like bus drivers and cab drivers and police officers and things like that i think they should be randomly drug tested i believe full force in that uh-huh yeah yeah i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be true you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so i don't know i i'm kind of biased too because i don't do drugs and so i really don't care one way or another if anybody wants to pull me up tomorrow and test me because i have nothing to worry about uh-huh yeah so i guess that's kind of biased yeah well and it's i i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job yeah it does if somebody else is impaired because generally you know it um you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job yeah that's true and if even even if like you say even if it's just the secretary if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers then it it's still a problem yeah that's true so but what do you do about the occasional user that may have gone to a party three days before and you know it's it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything and they happen to be tested Monday morning and they could be fired for that you know that that's kind of unfair also well yeah i guess it comes with the turf yeah i guess so i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences yeah and then you're in in in terms of drugs they're illegal so you're that's true you're breaking the law anyway that's true um probably the the biggest problem with those is they don't do a real good job of of assessing for alcohol that's true and that's probably the biggest problem there is yeah i think so more than drugs and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab yeah they would pay for an alcohol but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation uh-huh well i guess that's one of the positive things that has has come out of it some of the employee assistance program if you do test positive for something yeah they will give you an opportunity opportunity opportunity to go get your life straight rather than to lose your job that's true and i think i think that's fair yeah and i think the benefits the company benefits in the long run yeah that's true that's about all i have to say on it what what kind of testing do they do when you went uh it's a urine test and they uh urine screen yeah it was really very official you have to go in a room solely by yourself sign papers that say you were totally alone sign papers that say this is yours and and you have to fill the bottle yourself and label it yourself and all of that so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's i guess or something uh-huh well that happens yeah i know i can't it's hard to believe but i guess it does it happens a lot there there are people that know pay other people for that i know i'm amazed at the things people will do to help them out yeah it is amazing i guess there are people that do that and they are those are expensive tests i'm glad i never had to pay for one yeah yeah it depends really really really on how how strong a test it is they've got different degrees as far as as how far back they can check yeah i guess so they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests they've they've got some companies that are doing um hair tests oh really yeah well that they'll pull out one of your hairs and they can apparently test um back a certain period of time how weird i didn't know that um because um some of the the residue ends up in your hair follicles you know it's kind of oh that's weird hair follicles i guess are just dead protein and they yeah and it it's apparently almost almost like a a calendar they they've got it pretty precise now that they can go back and look at in terms of growth in a hair when you used and and that type of thing that's wild so it's amazing the things they can find out from different things on your body yeah so i guess if they perfect that and then it's not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or give blood or something like that yeah that's true that's true i'm glad i never had to do that by giving blood i can't stand the thought of giving blood uh-huh i can't even do it for Wadley even though it's a good cause yeah well i enjoyed talking to you well i did too thank you uh-huh bye bye bye bye  all righty okay have you recently had to return anything yes i have okay tell me about it well i have a VCR and i've had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure and uh it's still not getting a real good picture oh my goodness and after about three hundred dollars i think it's going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine you mean it the warranty wasn't on it or so well i didn't get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh oh gosh so how about you well i haven't had to return anything recently but i you know i feel i'm going to i'm on a portable phone i'm going to go closer to the station here uh i i feel like things are are not made as well as they used to be i um just cause you for instance clothing i you know i have two children and um we we say they they like nice clothing and i spend a lot of money on it and it just doesn't last and i mean i'm very careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly what it says and it still still it they still wear out very quickly uh i find things that are sewn very poorly uh they they come come unhemmed or unstitched so easily well i will agree with that we've had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the first time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments right right um-hum seem like they're just they don't cut threads off they're just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous they never cut him off oh i know it's really it's silly and and my i have teenagers and they they think they want a certain brand or a certain item well when you buy a brand name that's popular you're paying for the brand name and not only that but they're no better than a lot of the the the no non name brand stuff so exactly that's what i you know i'm saying that the you know if i'm paying for the name and i'm paying that much money it'd better be a quality product now i do there's there are some that i think are a little bit better and i and i've been real pleased with them and my kids are have enjoyed wearing them and they've lasted until they've outgrown them but uh the majority of things um don't last and they're just very inferior and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i try i try to to buy things that are made in the USA because i think that's important and yet i find a lot of the the the homemade goods are are inferior and also with cars i um i i bought a new car last summer and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different dealers and i wanted to buy an American car because i had had a Toyota and i really liked it but i felt like i needed to buy buy something that was American made because i felt i owed that well i just could not find an American made car that i felt was worthy of the price they wanted and um i ended up buying another i ended up buying a Nissan and i love it well the Americans just haven't gotten the message yet that's one thing because i'm i'm the same way we i do own an American huh-uh car well a truck but uh in trucks i think you're pretty safe but in cars i've not had an American car that i've been really pleased with uh-huh oh i know one for gas mileage and two uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tune-ups every foreign car i've ever made i mean that i've ever bought i've i've loved it exactly uh-huh yeah and they're so much more solid they sound better when you're in them they feel you feel like you're in a car and not rattling around in something i you know i just i just am real pleased with the Nissan i had and i had a Subaru before the Toyota and i loved that it was just the best car i've ever had in fact i wanted to buy another another one but i really it really what didn't have what i wanted they didn't have the the type of family car i wanted but that car i had for five years and i never had one thing go wrong with it and it um only thing i had to have replaced was the clutch and i had to do that twice because it was my fault because i ride it all the time and uh so you know it wore out well clutches are something that you really can't judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and yeah you know that's those kind of items like that wear items there's no way you can judge no uh like brakes uh i we have a a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen thousand miles yeah that's true is that right it's just inherent for that car but the the car is super oh i know i've heard great things i'd rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh yeah oh yes and it's a safe car too it's a good made car for the most part it's been a good car we've had it for six years now oh that's great well that the the Subaru i had when i sold it it still had the tires the factory tires on it and the factory battery one i mean that's how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in five years i didn't have to get a new one and it worked perfectly and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didn't have that many it was low mileage i didn't think i had like thirty seven thousand miles on it which is nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it it's got good resale value and it was really a good car and you know it it kind of is frightening i think that you're right American uh manufacturers still haven't got the the idea that that quality is important and that well if you can see the transition what i'm beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole are beginning to uh-huh get larger but they're able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the US are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesn't improve drastically yes right uh-huh you're right you're right and that right there ought to tell them something oh yeah i know we have the technology but i think it's the the glut of the oil companies and and uh big business and the government um-hum yes in trying to control things that they shouldn't control and uh they're not controlling the things they should control exactly so i think there's a there's a lot of things there to be said and uh i will continue to buy foreign cars if that's the most reliable product especially when i'm paying for it that's right that's right because you and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do well the thing is when you have to take your car in continually because it's not working and pay that much money in repair price bills it's ridiculous i i had a Plymouth that was just the worst car in the world and i mean everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it i had it in to the dealership more than i had it out it was terrible and i got rid of it as fast as i could it was the most it was a lemon is what it was and uh you know i will never buy a Plymouth again simply because of that oh i know i'm the same way with GM i won't buy a GM car is that right yeah i like Ford trucks um-hum and then i like the foreign cars especially Honda i've had a Honda oh i've heard good things about a Honda that i liked and uh i mean it was super car yeah my niece has one and she loves it too yeah so i think you know but you really liked your Ford truck huh well it's been a good truck so far it's only got a forty two thousand miles on it uh-huh and so far so good don't know what's going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it yeah well i'm looking for a used truck for my son and it's it's really been hard because we i we just don't have that much money to spend to spend he just turned sixteen uh you know i don't i want to get an inexpensive truck a small one that um you know i only have to pay a couple of thousand or you know three thousand oh boy well trucks trucks keep they hold their value yeah pretty much and and even used trucks are pretty expensive yeah they are we did find a couple but um you know they just i wasn't real sure about them and uh so we we kind of passed them up um this one guy is not is trying to make up my his mind whether he wants to sell his it's a Mitsubishi and it's an eighty five and he wants to sell it for about two thousand but uh he's not sure he wants to give it up and start car payments again so we're kind of waiting for him to make that decision but oh i can't i can certainly understand that i don't want any car payments either in fact when mine's paid off and you know oh our other one's paid off uh i don't want to get another car until they just both fall apart yeah yeah they're car payments are outrageous now well it's it's just anymore they don't benefit you uh from the income tax stand point oh that's right and uh of course we just can't afford to trade cars like that so hum-um hum-um we're just going to make it go as far as it can and then when we're forced to get one we will well that's why it's important to find a car that you don't have to keep taking in for repairs because if you're gonna keep it a long time that's right are you i mean shoot you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on repairs which can be easily done these days yes easily easily and you know that another thing about not only about uh you know products but services you're not real sure of anymore you you take a car in and you think it's fixed or and and how do you know if they really even fixed it and and sometimes i wonder you know and it's kind of scary you just you're not sure where where are you from i'm from i'm originally from Ohio Ohio and where are you now i'm in Texas you're in Texas um-hum yeah i was going to say because uh i was going to say if you're up in the in the northern countries the salt would be a big factor on i didn't know how much how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing oh yeah yeah it's uh bad up there but i'm i've been in Texas like thirteen years now so yeah what are what part of Texas are you from uh from Coppell Coppell i'm from Plano Plano we're not yeah we're not too far away no really fact my brother lives in Plano is that right oh well uh-huh but i don't have much more to say about things i i feel the same way that you do though i think it things are you know need to get better and i think you need we need to have somehow more of a trust in in US made goods and it's sad that we don't but uh i would i would certainly like to And i hope that that before it's too late they do get the message and i i don't know i think a lot of it has to do with uh you know just the attitude of the  okay what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful have a big family i guess that's a start well i guess so have you had any in the last how well how old are you twenty five so i just got married okay so you have you have been to some family reunions perhaps right every four years on one side of my family they plan on having um like my parents grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids now how long in advance do they uh let them know well we plan on it it's like the third weekend in August so it's every four years and so uh-huh so they all know it yeah and then you know arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know um food and whose whose staying where because a lot of people from are from down here in Texas and uh a lot of my family is in Indiana that's where i'm originally from uh-huh uh-huh yes so um we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the um at the lake and uh make a couple days of it well that sounds like fun do they all have the small children too that come yeah pretty much so all ages yeah and uh you know there's some my age and then there are some a lot younger an about four generations i guess well my husband has uh on one side has an extended family uh-huh and they don't ever plan it like as like you do i think if you can count on it every four years then uh-huh people have it in mind so they have to start talking about it or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody because they're rather socially active too uh-huh yeah and so it has it seems that by doing it about six months ahead they can pretty much get everybody there if they don't you know they'll say oh we're planning to go so and so that go to to a certain place that weekend with somebody else and we're already locked in but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them uh-huh my family uh my parents are the youngest of very large families oh therefore they don't have many people left yeah and uh the few previous ones i've had uh i haven't known many of those people but uh in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family and that's been very nice with uh i have one sister and three brothers uh-huh and they're only three out of five of us who have children oh so uh we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other and that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large yeah uh-huh and they don't see each other very often we don't really know many of them yeah that's kind of bad it really is they're fun they're a lot of fun but uh still uh they're not done on a regular basis yeah and uh you kind of forget what happened and who they were from the time before yeah yeah it's it's fun getting together with immediate family a lot of my cousins are real close and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that so uh those are the ones that are in Texas um no the ones in Indiana uh-huh or you go to Indiana on that uh-huh where in Indiana Lafayette Lafayette i don't know where i used to live in Indianapolis yeah it's a little north of Indianapolis about an hour yeah yeah it's very pretty country in there i think it's gorgeous uh-huh so well i uh when is your next one uh scheduled now uh-huh well it's like the last one was my high school graduation the next one was when i graduated from college so i guess about two more years yes well and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you uh maybe i don't know two more years i don't know probably maybe i mean you need another milestone you know yeah i guess that's that's what i mean i've been married now for about nine months so that was another milestone i guess yes well i'm sure and have then all of your family probably has not met your husband um yeah he's from Indiana so they all met yeah oh is he and and he's living your both living in Sherman yeah do you work to TI uh-huh and does he uh-huh no he's trying to get in med school uh-huh well we don't either but uh i have a friend who uh is working on this project so oh really yes and are they getting all the data they need well i don't know uh i i have a hard time getting uh people on the telephone oh really uh-huh getting through to anybody sometimes i call off and on all day huh but anyway uh i guess we're supposed to be talking about family reunions aren't we but i got off that well we've kind of exhausted everything i guess yes well um i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes oh okay and uh uh we both look forward to going to our next reunions i'm sure oh yeah but it has been fun talking to you well you too and maybe i'll talk to you again okay bye-bye thank you okay good bye-bye  um you know one thing that i miss being in a small company is the opportunity for um job growth just different job opportunity i was talking with somebody from Bausch and Lomb today and she was telling me how she started as a clerk typist and then found another opening in another department and moved on and so forth and so forth and is now uh personnel uh director and i mean it's just it's there's so much opportunity in a larger company to uh stay within the same company so you're not losing your seniority level but um just to try new things and and see new areas and departments and i mean you can in in a large company you can go from one department to another department as if if you switched companies sometimes well yes you have an opportunity to to use a J O B system which is a job opportunity system it's most companies most big companies have that but um-hum well i think sometime that you get lost in that also uh-huh uh-huh i really do i i i sometimes think that a small company may offer well i'm not sure how to put well uh-huh i'm not sure how to put this but that's not uh perhaps better one on one uh relations a a big company sometime you can get lost you can you can uh opportunities do arise uh-huh but the competition is much greater for that uh-huh uh-huh well it's true yeah opportunity okay there is a very uh uh at least in my office and i know that's not necessarily the way it is all over but the camaraderie within the office when you're with a small company i think you're right you could be even uh you can be a big person in a small company you know exactly i and i think you get a lot more support from your coworkers and and often times in a big company you are asked to go and do things in other areas that uh-huh uh-huh may not be your expertise okay but they require you to do this as their as your uh stepping stone or whatever you'd care to call it uh-huh uh-huh and and that can get to be sometimes very very disastrous with the consequences of that because people do the best they can uh-huh sure and often times it's not really what right was aimed at in the first place if that makes sense uh-huh i yeah i understand that you know a question that i have for you is um do you feel working working in a large company do you feel that you can see the impact that you make do you feel that you can see like the results i know in my company each person is vital because we are the company and each person really can see the results that they produce yes i can i see that in my job because my particular job is of of a troubleshooting nature and i'm you know it's one of these put out fires things so uh-huh oh uh-huh i can see the results of that i see yeah but um yes i i'm i i get a lot of gratification from my job but some some folks i guess they go to work every day and they just go to work for a paycheck every every two weeks or every month or whatever yeah i i but in my particular job i really enjoy it because i do have an opportunity to help other people do better okay and i really like that uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i i do feel bad for the people i mean obviously we all work for a paycheck but it's nice if you can be enjoying it you know while you're doing it yes yeah i i i also teach school at at TI at uh Texas Instruments i'm a i'm an instructor there so oh uh-huh i teach new well not new employees but all yeah all employee any employees really that that care to and we talked about the job opportunity system we have uh a system where we train people to to become what we call automation specialists uh-huh and and it's a job where if you as a secretary you decide you want to be uh an automation specialist which is a much higher paying job and a much more technical job uh-huh and then you would come to one of our in-house classes that is great on on company time oh really and and and or on overtime so we don't involve the the uh production process okay of of personnel coming to our classes and we set up and establish these uh-huh sixteen and twenty week classes at at uh three hours a day twice a week for automation specialist training that is wonderful when you finish hopefully you've acquired enough knowledge to uh you know move on into advanced machinery type operations and uh-huh and and that that's really gratifying to me i i see a lot of young folks come in and and gals and guys both and some gals that say i've no i don't know a hammer from a a nail or a wrench i mean you know and okay that's and that's where we'll start but and we have the other side of the coin where you have you know really advanced people uh-huh uh-huh well yeah coming in and and top notch uh mechanical type people and they want to do better so they of come they they jump right on it uh-huh uh-huh that is great and that is so smart because with uh everything becoming so much more technical and sophisticated you're just not finding people out in the work force that have the skills that you necessarily need no that's a fact and i mean you just don't find them and it it's such such a great way take the people that you already have and train them and train and train them we sometimes we have to uh simply for for two reasons one yeah uh-huh that we we are changing jobs constantly where we are changing our methods of doing things and we are finding more economical methods and more uh-huh uh-huh okay and the other thing is we cannot find the people outside to just walk in off the street and help us uh-huh right so but that would be the same in your type of secretarial job i'm that one time we the girls used to have just the typewriter and they uh-huh exactly and then they had word processors and now they've got full blown desk top publishers so you know oh my oh exactly i mean it's incredible it is i i'm that amazes me that you know people say your job amazes me well my job is really nothing i sit there and i watch some little gal make me all kinds of charts and view foils and graphs and um yeah yeah uh-huh and it's i it's you know they use laser printers and all that and it's absolutely mind boggling uh because i could probably turn it on before i get the screen to go completely blank you know and i generally do that wow yeah uh-huh uh-huh but i i was in the same situation i had to learn right i i had no knowledge of a computer at all i'm a master mechanic but not a computer expert right but now i'm in to Lotus and word processing and i can hold my own with that oh that's great that is fabulous but um you know another benefit that that i wish i had more of and who wouldn't is vacation time uh-huh yeah you know um i think that uh when when you're working and an especially i don't know i mean every job you you say how you're constantly putting out fires you know i i feel like my job is like that too unfortunately but that just it drains you you know after a while it just yeah i i i feel that way and it's a long time to get you know you work for many years with two weeks vacation per year yeah yeah exactly right and then if you have extra days out for what other reasons uh there may be uh an and we we try to deal on an individual basis with them but you can be penalized for that an and it it's penalized against your merit increases and et cetera uh-huh oh oh wow so i mean you are allowed a certain number of days of what we call sick time and personal time off but if you you know if you extend beyond those uh-huh uh-huh an and at times we will adjust on a one to one basis right uh-huh for some unusual circumstances but uh-huh to work for a company almost fifteen years with two weeks vacation it seems to me like an awful long time it's hard is that uh what your company policy is too well no it well in some instances yes uh-huh okay in some instances it would be we start with a a weeks vacation and then it's two weeks after a year or so uh-huh but then that two weeks stays and then it goes to three weeks for a long long time and then after fifteen years it's four weeks uh-huh uh-huh oh my goodness but that's still that's a long time you know but that is a long time and especially when you take a weeks vacation i was just talking to somebody about this today it's funny it takes you until Tuesday or Wednesday to really wind down oh sure you know to say okay i i can relax i can sit here for an hour if i want to and just not do anything and realize that you don't have to be worrying about something you know i think uh i would like to see i would like to see more well it's like the kids were talking in California about going to school all year but they have breaks every ninety days or thirty days or ninety days or whatever it is they have two weeks off or a week off or something uh-huh uh-huh right and they find that that's much better for them than having the whole summer off an where they're completely bored like the second month into i think i think industry really would really uh-huh that's true benefit from that uh-huh i'm not sure how we would accommodate all of our people being on vacation at all various times but we would always be shorthanded i guess but so that's a problem you know that's a problem pardon me yeah well that's where temporaries come in they could hire temporaries to fill in well yes that's and that's exactly what we do in many instances you know where our work load increases an and our vacation periods and stuff uh-huh uh-huh of course we have uh what we called an SDS a Summer Development Student Program so oh we we put a lot of school um like a co-op type thing for the summer college pardon me like a co-op for the summer almost yeah yeah they work for us and and they they go to school back in the Fall uh-huh uh-huh and hopefully when they get out of college they consider us to come on full-time right and they've uh established themselves with a work pattern an and the you know they're familiar to our uh-huh uh-huh right our ways and stuff and they're on our records and we find that that's very very helpful yeah i that is and uh it also gives you a chance you know to look at these kids and make your own determinations you sound uh like a very young person i'm twenty five i  okay Nancy what do you think about drug testing i'm all for it uh-huh because i i think if you don't do it you don't have anything to worry about it all right and i don't do drugs so i never worry about it and i i think it's a i think it's a good idea i i even think the random is fine you know you shouldn't do it and that's in a nutshell and i think you know i say if you if you don't do it you really really don't have to worry it yeah yeah do you feel that see i don't know what questions to ask because i'm i agree with you and i was hoping to find someone that disagreed so i could so i i could fire questions at them well i you just uh like i say i just think it's a a fine idea and i the companies that i've heard that had a random testing i think it's a great idea uh where i work they don't but do random testing and uh now when i hired in i had to have a uh a drug test which was fine with me i i wasn't worried at all about that but and then i think that's perfectly i don't think it's infringing on your rights or i think the company has a right to have employees that are drug free right what do you think company should do if they find someone that tests positive well i guess i'd give them i'd give them one chance maybe i i don't know person i'd fire if it was my company i'd fire them right then but not you know in today's society you can't do that yeah i guess you guess have to give them a a warning and then then the second time they'd be terminated um if they tested positive and i really would watch them after that but uh would you help them get into a drug rehab program i'd probably send them on a EAT program you know Employee Assistance Program i'd i'd make them go through that and uh the first time they'd have to go through the EAT program and i think most companies have those now i think they have it must be a law or something because awful lot of companies have them and i'd make them do that uh-huh and if they refused to do that then they'd be fired way i'd do it what would you do uh probably about the same thing just uh give them a chance you know with a positive have them sit down with their boss and their boss's boss and uh you know just talk with them about what happened what the problem was possibility there's a possibility that uh you know you've got to give somebody a benefit of the doubt because everybody would probably say oh well that's just you know i just tried it once to see what it'd be like yeah or maybe it's a my antihistamine i was on that you know tested positive i i don't do it you know you never know if they're telling the truth or not yeah so you pretty much got to give everybody one shot second chance yeah yeah and then after that you might want to and and if they admit to having a problem or something you know i would help them out as as long as they wanted help and would stay in the program i'd you know help them out yeah right right but if they flat refused you know and said no i won't then i'd say well then i'm sorry then you can't say we're not going to have druggies in our payroll the way i'd look at it yeah right fortunately i've never had to worry about that since i i have never even tried uh a puff or whatever it uh you know and if somebody gave me a thousand dollars and said Nancy go by some dope i wouldn't even know where to go buy it i'm sure you can at any high school or any street corner they tell me but i don't know yeah what if along a similar topic straying from the drug thing what about what do you think about AIDS testing for uh say you're a physician and uh a patient comes in and wants treated should you have the right to test them for AIDS uh i guess if he suspected sure i wouldn't because if i was a physician i wouldn't want to test them i mean i wouldn't want to treat them for fear that they would you know i i'd get that but yeah i think if if you suspect it and i'm sure a doctor can look at somebody and suspect don't you think by looking at them in advanced cases yes yeah not probably not at the first i don't know right i don't know if you if they have the right or not i never had never really thought of that see that's a question i'm wondering because i'm pursuing a career in medicine uh-huh and you know they're deciding that in the courts you know as i'm continuing my education uh-huh so it would you know by the time i get out and begin practicing then i don't know you you know or could be either way i would definitely want to know if these people have AIDS i mean i'm the you're right oh i would too absolutely absolutely i just don't uh but and and i would if i were a doctor i wouldn't i i don't think it's anything wrong for a doctor to refuse to i don't care about the Hippocratic oath i don't think they should have to treat a patient with AIDS if they don't want to you know why take a chance like that doctor in New York that got infected from a patient and you know she ended up i think she died i don't remember if she died or not but she's suing that hospital because uh she was working with uh with a AIDS patient that got them so i i don't know i don't think i would uh that's treat one it's such a tough issue i i just wanted to throw that out to you to make the conversation a little more interesting because since we both agree it's kind of hard to you're isn't that totally boring oh me well uh no i like i say i've only been tested the one time when i hired in uh i had was tested for drugs and of course they do everybody you can't work where i work unless you're tested for it and so that you know and that was fine with me but they make you do all the sealing you know you you have to do everything yourself they're not allowed to seal them or yeah tag them or anything you you do it all yourself they tell you what to do but you do it all yourself huh so if there's a mistake it's your mistake i guess yeah i don't know uh you work for TI no i did years ago for seventeen years i worked uh in Fort Worth at a a landing gear company Menasco oh oh and uh love it just love it i wish i'd f ound this company twenty years ago but uh so i started out at TI years ago my daughter works at TI is that how you got on the yeah because she was on it and she how did you get on it phone program my wife works for TI yeah oh does she yeah i liked TI i loved it i quit quit back in eighty five uh and went with Martin Marietta down in Orlando and just hated Orlando Orlando just oh yeah just hated it couldn't wait to get back and it took me about almost four years to get back but i made it yeah and but i've almost doubled my salary since leaving TI now that's how bad TI pays i have almost doubled my salary i really have and i yeah wow uh but i love TI i really i really enjoyed working there and uh but you know it wasn't to be anymore yeah had to move on but uh yeah they you know i know they do the random testing at TI and i i i don't see anything wrong with that if you know if they i don't even know they don't even have to do it on suspicion they can they can just do it and uh yeah and they do it quite often i understand and i don't blame them at all i mean yeah their company and you're a danger to people if you're on drugs and i think you're a danger to to people that you work with and then they have too much sophisticated equipment out there to have somebody out you know doped up working around it i think right so uh and i understand that they even if even if you see somebody off you know away from work using drugs uh-huh that you can come back and and rat on them and they'll get them that way if you see them at a party to you know doing dope you can go back to work and tell on them huh is what i've understand i've heard well it's pretty serious yeah it is they're they're cracking down on them but uh that's good you know somebody needs to get tough on these guys you know and you know and they take them to court and then they just slap them on the hand and let them the dealers out and you know i just makes me sick i that's why we have so much crime i know it's because of dope yeah a lot of it is for sure i know when i was growing up you could sleep with your windows open well even my kids were growing up we didn't lock our house at night we just went to bed you know and left the doors open the windows open you could walk take walks at night you can't do that anymore that's right and i think most of it's drug related most of the crime that we have is drug related and uh i i don't i don't think my children have ever if they did i didn't know it yeah but i know they've never been on it if they ever tried it i didn't know it and because my son was a athlete and athletes normally can't don't do it because they're you know they have to stay in shape my daughter my daughter just wasn't the type she just didn't care for stuff like that and neither one of them smoked cigarettes either so that's that's right well that's good yeah i really is i did when they were growing up and i think that's why they don't because i did and i quit about ten years ago and it was the smartest thing i ever did yeah good took shots from a doctor in Richardson and haven't had a puff since huh she gave shots in the nose and in the ears and in the arm six shots and that's it never smoked again wow so well that's good yeah i'm real proud of myself well Nancy it's been good talking to you good nice talking to you if i can will um good luck on it well thank you and uh i guess i'll brace myself for a heavy storm coming my way oh you you please do all righty talk to you bye-bye bye  okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth uh yeah they've sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too i've been sort of irresponsible a couple of years ago and i'm still paying for the the my own stupidity yeah yeah well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce uh-huh and i will never own another joint credit card oh you're because uh even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it uh-huh if you're a cosigner on it they'll still come after you if the other person doesn't if the other person doesn't yeah and boy that that's that's a rotten deal oh i'd i'd say so and isn't it isn't it now on those those cards was it um mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah yeah yeah about twenty thousand dollars worth twenty thousand i can't imagine any anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card wholly smokes but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it yeah that's got to be like and close to what a thousand bucks a month yeah and they said well i'm sorry even though the card is in her name you you're a cosigner on it and i i threatened you know legal action and everything i i don't know i've sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from from my credit uh-huh rating and uh haven't heard anything back but i haven't run a credit check either right yeah you might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar uh yeah credit checks just to find out what it says yeah but uh that's uh i'll never own another joint yeah credit card i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um yeah uh program manager for the Air Force and uh i uh i have to go on uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but i've been trying to curtail my use of it to to nothing except with the exception of uh of them those type things yeah yeah and i also found out something else uh for your information and i don't know if you're married or not no i'm not but uh one of the credit cards the uh the account was paid off uh-huh oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying uh uh she's behind in her payments and i said well i don't care she's my ex-wife yeah and uh they said well your name is still on file as cosigner oh gee so even dormant credit cards you have uh you you have to go and send them a copy and tell them you're not responsible for any bills right but uh it it can turn into a mess sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasn't even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what what when you right right oh my gosh because the the credit card was zero it was you know don't and it was dormant yeah guess the the bottom line is uh you got to be darn sure you're marrying the right person when you that's right when you do that too but uh i guess a divorce in any yeah circumstance doesn't normally they're sir either that or make or each each party have their own own uh credit card not a joint yeah that's for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother and his his wife ran up thousands of dollars in credit well i guess they're they are both responsible for the stupid things but um yeah had a similar situation and then it was almost like he couldn't get a divorce because uh uh i guess she didn't even work or anything and then he would've been yeah strapped with everything yeah he would have been stuck with everything yeah i yeah i remember about the only credit cards i have now are are gas cards uh-huh but they're in my name only yeah well i know i'm about uh thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to lump everything together so that and it's down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only yeah little yeah system because uh i'm just i am very sort of irked at this at these credit card companies and you know they got you yeah and uh you'll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line and right and uh and it also makes it bad because you can't deduct that interest now no no you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct deduct all that interest and finance charges right right can't even do that anymore yeah yeah i remember uh was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right yeah yeah well you uh this last year was ten percent uh-huh this next time it's zero yeah well remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger uh two years ago than it was this year yeah that's for sure yeah about only the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and uh right right and taxes but uh i credit cards you can i can't even declare that here because uh in my situation because it's uh uh not until i sell it the the way it works for me because i own it as uh-huh jointly with my father and uh yeah the they've changed those or it's a ends up getting classified as a rental property and it's not classified as a regular family dwelling so there's some reason we can't right right declare any mortgage interest do you do you or your father either one have it homesteaded um do you mean do we do i live in it or no no homesteaded what what does that mean uh in Texas uh you get a uh a big tax break if you if you call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and and i live here oh oh and well that would be an interesting situation because i'm a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because i'm in the Air Force and um i'm living here in New York so i can i can't even vote here oh yeah a property owner but i can't vote huh yeah so that's crazy yeah well that's only fair because the reason i'm a resident resident of Pennsylvania is because they don't charge military income tax oh that's so so and so it's like Texas Texas doesn't either yeah uh at least now yeah or they're they're talking about instituting a uh state income tax yeah everything else that that would bring in money the uh the the people want it but the uh the congress or Texas State Congress and so forth won't pass a bill to do it like a uh lottery uh-huh they've been trying to get a lottery i think the last poll they had here seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery right and yet the uh the House voted it down the Texas House voted it down huh they all they want to do is increase property taxes and sure put a income tax in well i don't know just getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh thing maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month it makes you right it makes you pay it yeah i i do have an American Express but i got it through uh TI yeah i've got a Diner's Club through the government as well yeah they it's a it's a yeah it's a yeah it's a corporate they force us to have yeah uh government Diner's Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart i'd get rid of the American Express and get yeah stop paying that annual fee on it but yeah and if you're late on this on my American Express they write TI ooh since it's a corporate corporate American yeah that that's not good and if you don't pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasn't this been paid yeah oh jeez so you don't dare run up anything on it that you can't you know that you can't pay that's that's the problem with credit cards it it's really people don't think of it as cash no they think of it like uh monopoly money that hey i can just charge this right and pay it wherever i feel like it yeah it's like going oh i'll have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and yeah a few other things and then you're like oh jeez hey right yeah yeah i know that feeling huh so i guess the the secret's not to have credit cards yeah oh well i'm getting to just about to that point myself so well i guess we've been i'm surprised they hadn't beeped in and said your ten minutes is up yeah really they've been they've been uh even before ten minutes here lately they've been saying you should cut it off oh really i haven't i it i actually haven't timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation ends on it's own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice well listen i've enjoyed talking with you yeah it's nice talking to you Jerry and uh  i was afraid for a while she wasn't going to find anyone because they were all out on the golf course oh really well it's it's raining in Texas right now in my area so there's probably not any golfers out on the course okay oh uh yeah i they just they just said that the uh Byron Nelson Tournament here had been suspended oh no for because of rain of course that's just for today it'll it'll play again finish tomorrow you know or finish today's round tomorrow yeah well near Dallas you're used to playing golf in the wind too oh right yeah yeah well i i'm not really much of a golfer i have not played golf in probably fifteen years but uh it it is an intention to take up the the uh sport again the biggest problem with it i think is time right uh yeah and i i know that it's a four hour dedication it could be four hour relaxation or it could be gritting on your nerves which you're using that much time uh and not not having that much fun yeah right well yeah if if you're good at it i guess it's a not so much frustration but if you are it it you know if you're not a really good golfer it it can be real frustrating real frustrating you know and i i played tennis for exercise but i play golf for fun uh and yeah apparently it's the attitude that you have that makes the big difference the uh i i enjoy catching it too do you ever go out to the well i it's been a while since i've been out to watch i do watch a little on TV you know when i have the chance but uh uh-huh uh-huh i keep wondering why i you can understand in sports like uh basketball or baseball or football there's an age yeah uh position in there but i keep wondering why some of the real legends can't go just a little bit longer than they do well you know i wonder that too in watching some of these senior tournaments uh you know the uh the seniors skins and stuff like that on TV you see how well they're playing and you and you wonder why they're they're not able to you know to play with right it the regular tour with the with the younger guys on the regular tour and they do mix some of them mix it but it's uh it it does amaze me sometimes just to see it i don't know whether it's a lack of concentration or particular muscle development or what but it seems to be uh i to me it's not a sport that you would be overwhelmed with muscle activity in it right well as i understand it and of course it's like i said it's been a while since i played but uh as i understand it as you do get older that your concentration in the putting area you know really suffers and that's that's the primary reason that some of these older that you know that the old players don't play as well um-hum um-hum but uh i tell you what it's a sport that has a great number of jokes though oh yeah i i as i said i play tennis and there are no tennis jokes i don't know if you can think of one at all i guess come to think of it i've never heard a tennis joke but but there are a slew of golf jokes so it it indicated and it's great uh sport for equalizing the handicap system yeah right and uh allows you to play competitively even though you don't play on the same level play competitively with just about anyone you know i can go out and stand a chance of winning a dime off of Jack Nicholas right uh if the handicap system uh worked properly and it should so yeah it's nice to be able to to uh compete and and be together with someone and yet have a basis for competitiveness such as uh ten cent be anything over a a dime i joke on so and perhaps and perhaps even learn a little bit of something oh yes oh yeah it's interesting we're talking about golf the television own in my den right now and i'm watching a ball roll up about four inches from the hole in today's Byron Nelson so well you know that's one of the other things i i'd i'm am fascinated sometimes two sports bring it to mind more quickly than any others but all the other functions that the human body performs really are are uh as equally amazing But when you start thinking about the eye hand coordination and trying to get a little sphere uh four hundred and twenty yards away into a little whole in about four shots uh-huh and it's true you have loft of club and everything else but knowing how far to bring it back and the the concentration and all the things that go on in the human body to get it there there's a awful lot of mechanics involved in yeah the same the same thing is true with basketball where a a fellows running along and runs and jumps up in the air and then pushes the basketball toward uh a hoop and it swishes through yeah the the the human body is amazing and i think i'd like to see uh elements like that in almost everything i do and golf uh i walk down the fairways sometimes just thinking about that and then of course i'll miss the putt yeah so well what uh what course do you get to play on over in North Carolina but we just moved here from from Oklahoma as a matter of fact and i'd been in Oklahoma for twenty years up in Enid oh yeah uh-huh but so uh i'm used to the wind too yeah in fact that's the only that areas the only place i know of that you really have to uh consider the wind on putts out on the grass green and everything else but the wind effect yeah yeah yeah but i guess in North Carolina you you're in an area where there are some really nice courses oh i know it i know we had just moved to Charlotte and uh i've gone to a couple of uh public courses uh we haven't settled in here yet we're just uh here temporarily but a the courses are beautiful and you can play just about year round on it too yeah that's now Richardson maybe you can too yeah right Richardson h as it's you know it's pretty close to year round there are times uh well i guess that there are times in the winter you know when you can't play but then there are times when you know when it thaws out and warms up and people flock to the golf course you know in December and January so yeah yeah in fact uh the last few years i've had in Oklahoma i went to Norman and it would play New Year's day down there now there it was stretching the imagination to enjoy it but at least i played yeah probably a week later it was warm enough you could have gone out and played and really enjoyed it even then so uh-huh uh-huh well i have enjoyed talking to you yeah i have enjoyed it too i i really intend to play golf you know in the future my my wife and i even uh yeah are going to try to play together sometime you know yeah yeah well that that's a good sport when people enjoy it because it can be very social at the same time yeah right well it's been nice talking to you okay good luck on the course okay you too thanks bye  we're supposed to talk about the Middle East crisis and should we be involved and uh what's it going to cost us in the long run okay okay are you ready i guess so the Middle East crisis should we be there oh dear that's a hard one that's really hard for me because uh you know i really i have a son that's sixteen and i think you know eventually you know he'll be of of drafting age and i think gosh do i want him to go and yet i'm proud to be an American and i know that we have a a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have and yet i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for for this country and yet and yet i know that i that and i i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism but i'm not sure that that that's the reason anymore i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was and i'm not sure that that that's the reason why we're like we were in Vietnam supposedly so well you realize why we were in the Middle East why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and we we're why we are still fighting Iraq well with the well it's because of oil isn't it no i really believe it's because i think it has something to do with oil don't get me wrong um-hum but Saddam is Saddam is a madman oh yes i agree with that anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people oh yeah well yeah he's uh a bad person very definitely yeah and obviously that has something to do with it oh sure sure and and if you know i can see that he was in Kuwait um-hum Kuwait was the non aggressor um-hum um-hum and the Saudis are our allies we have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years yeah many years you know they've been our friends through thick and thin um-hum they were at the Saudi border well um-hum and ready to storm into Saudi shouldn't we try and help our friends certainly but what at at what cost you know that's the uh the thing it came out it came out wonderfully supposedly i mean everything is and we won what did we lose forty one Americans lives yeah and that that's wonderful but what if if that wasn't the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i don't know see and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know but oh of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks the American people oh sure well and there's a lot that we and that's our own fault because we elected them yeah i think that's true but i think there's a lot that we the public doesn't need to know i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national national security sake and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i don't i don't think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldn't know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too you know it's uh i went on jury duty here not long back um-hum and uh one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyer's reputation was so tainted that he couldn't be believed um-hum and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up you know and um-hum the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer he said that when he graduated the day after his bar examine there in Houston um-hum um-hum he told him dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving oh my gosh oh and ninety percent of all politicians are lawyers oh i have a lawyer background yeah have a law background you're right so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars the fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves yeah that's true yeah that's true so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi are we going to lose more lives there see and i don't know i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam i know yeah and whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume um-hum um-hum there's nothing they can do about it right you know it's not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong um-hum um-hum we were there the Brits were there the French were there this is with UN backing um right um-hum and to some level even Russia was behind us um-hum right they were so honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it oh sure sure but what i can't understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didn't fight wouldn't fight um-hum it's okay for us to go expend our youth's um-hum lives like so much water in the desert yeah yeah and it's not their job to fight for their own land yeah that is very it's very strange uh and yet you know see that's another thing that that's difficult for Americans their culture is so much different than ours that you know i've heard from many people that we could not even begin begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours and um they just don't think the same way we do their culture is completely different and almost opposite and really from all i can indicate from all indications the Iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own um-hum yeah that's true and the Kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country the Kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything they won't work huh i didn't realize that yeah it was on the news last night oh my word the uh US Army is doing it all hum yeah see and that's another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know i don't know the answers to that those questions i think they're tough and i think you know it's i don't know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure well they talked to uh one Kuwaiti woman yesterday um-hum and her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper you're kidding that's unreal and do you have a housekeeper no no and don't plan on having one either ever so well i wouldn't mind having one oh i'd love to have one but you know but you know i'd like to uh make sure that i have a job tomorrow first sure sure that's right that's right it it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money uh no i wasn't i didn't wasn't aware of that no for nothing for doing nothing yeah for nothing for for for doing nothing for sitting on there keisters um-hum um-hum ooh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldn't it uh they do nothing they hand them money each year and they're part of  hi this is Judy i'm from Maryland and i'm in California visiting right now hi Judy this is Norma and i live in Virginia oh okay we got a great topic i know i'm sitting here going oh dear should we give it a try i guess we might as well okay okay okay well um so so so what changes have you seen let you start what changes uh i guess the biggest i don't know your age Judy but i in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working definitely well actually that's what i was thinking too yeah and um you know just to jump ahead a little bit but then we can back up is it perhaps women in politics is for the future for the future right yeah because i don't see that really yet in positions of power really right i don't see them in positions in power in corporations either not many ah that's true that's true um do you work in private corporation or government i did work in government ah and before that i worked in a bank for eight years um-hum um-hum and now i'm retired oh are you that's the best status yes um i don't i see um in that's right which do you work in excuse me a government in government and i work in academia before uh-huh and um actually there's one um woman in our i don't know what you'd call it uh institute who is a manager and i mean in a sense perhaps um a lot of she gets protected a lot because uh it's almost like a token oh and and it's sort of unfortunate because i think that they don't accept her technically and but she's a good paper pusher uh-huh and it's in a technical position really and you know she should be more technical for what she does uh-huh and i think that's sort of unfortunate because it doesn't it doesn't really help the cause in the long run right um but um you know i don't know and and teaching i still see that that's where most of the women are in teaching in teaching and you know and it's always been that way but not at the college level right not well we live in a college town and i worked at the university for a while and there are there are woman there but they're not the high paid uh-huh um-hum not department chairmen professors that the men are yeah not the deans and things like that well they did have one woman dean but and i guess she she probably did very well but that's the minority um-hum um-hum hum and do you think it's because women aren't qualified or or just don't or don't want the job or just aren't hired for the jobs none of the above i think they are extremely well qualified uh-huh uh i don't know how they're just not selected somehow i think they're not selected um-hum and course at this university uh this it's a big engineering school um-hum and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college uh-huh and that's where the high pay is oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering actually but you know i say that but yet i know two quite an well i think there are more than there used to be yeah i'm sure there are yeah but they may not go into teaching um-hum yeah i mean the two that i know obviously are not in teaching but um uh-huh it's it i suppose in a since i was surprised when they told me they majored majored in engineering i don't know why i but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering either uh-huh i mean it's just because i'm in the humanities it's just oh uh-huh you know it's not not something that i tend to hear about yeah uh-huh but um yeah it's uh well i met one one day that uh had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering and that really surprised me oh that's interesting uh-huh yeah yeah i mean i i suppose that that it's difficult to really say why because you know there there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified uh-huh and maybe there aren't you know maybe they don't apply for the job i don't know i don't i don't know how many go on and get a PhD in engineering right right which could be you know partial partially cultural anyway that could be that's true so that it might be circularly being the same problem of of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway so why spend your time getting qualified uh-huh that's right it's a it's a rough it's a rough a rough situation um and i guess what i what amazes amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids or and in our case we actually have one father who works part-time a six hour day so that he can take the kids oh kids or kid i'm not sure to school in the morning and be home that's interesting when the children or child comes home in the afternoon is it uh was she the major wage earner i mean did she earn more money that he did or do you know th is is uh well see i don't know anything about the family but but yeah i would imagine she might um because he's you you know he's a really nice guy but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job oh uh-huh so that maybe he you know maybe she was more qualified but still but still it's interesting that you know he he's been doing this evidently for a a good number of years uh-huh and but it's unusual i i know one uh gal that's she's a CPA and her husband is a house husband uh-huh yeah i and then they had a child and he he still was the house husband he's the one that was going to oh he was even before they had children uh-huh even before that right oh now that that really is she was a little perturbed about it at one time i don't know how she's moved away i don't know how it is now but i know uh oh she was uh-huh we're we all went out one evening and after work and uh she was there was an underlying note that she was perturbed about it uh-huh yeah i mean i think that would be it would it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for uh-huh somebody to stay home that i don't think there was a valid reason because her statement was yeah that's true i told him let's face it you're a house husband that's what your going that's what you'll always be but but yet you know we have to think about that because if if she had opted to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything strange she wouldn't have been that's right uh-huh that's right it would so so we're carrying our own prejudice it wouldn't have been a downer uh-huh that's true yeah oh gee i guess we can't win huh-uh oh because yeah if if somebody does it and breaks tradition you're surprised but that's right oh dear so so i think maybe more men would like to be if they weren't put down so badly if they could get away with it oh dear you know well i mean it it's an interesting topic yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of of thought to but um huh-uh no i don't in the past it's um one of those things that you know seems to happen how do you feel your career has gone i don't i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against you don't that's good no i was a department chairman i don't but i don't like administration oh so then i'm uh uh probably a poor example although you know i was an administrator and could still be i suppose uh-huh uh-huh i was discriminated against very definitely in banking uh-huh it was terrible oh really you were you were more ambitious than they would let you be right and the money didn't go with the positions yeah yeah well i would the promotion promotions came but there were there wasn't comparable pay for the responsibility and i was told you don't need as much pay as i have because your children are older than my children or your husband has a good job and uh oh jeez yeah actually in a since i suppose when i was hired into the government um at i was taken advantage of and and that's true that you know sometimes other people get get higher increments i think uh-huh for you know even i think we are programmed to just take it as it comes right right that's probably true i hadn't i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do and i just sort of ignore the administrative part of it since i didn't like it when when i had to do it uh-huh uh-huh so i i figure you know nobody must uh nobody must like it it must be a rotten job for everybody but i know some people thrive on it oh gee well since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic i don't  okay um i don't have any i guess definite views about elderly care um the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see where elderly people are abused and things like that i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was uh-huh yeah putting my grandmother or my mother uh in some sort of home the first thing that i would look at would be their history right as far as any court cases that came out of there um the history of you know their doctors um their nurses and things like that yeah yeah i agree with you i um a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to a um they call it the Heritage House they call it the Heritage House it's it's a nursing home for elderly people and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape a lot of them have had uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh um limbs amputated or um have serious illnesses you know that kind of thing and uh-huh um i watched the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands it started out just being a terrible place for the people and then a new company bought it uh-huh uh-huh and came in and remodeled the whole place hired new nurses and uh just really just redid it you know uh-huh i'm just out of curiosity what what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place well to me it was dirty for one thing uh when you would walk in the smell was just awful though you know the floors you could just huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh if you're walking on them feel how filthy they were um there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and you know crying and uh oh my goodness of course i don't know how many of them were you know not in their right mind or how many were uh-huh you know yeah yeah i just really don't know but i feel like they were neglected and um in pain or something yeah uh-huh yeah that's what i was going to say it sounds like to just neglect all over neglect you know to clean up and right right right i don't really think anyone was being you know cruel or or trying to mistreat them or anything i just think they were just not doing anymore you know than they had to do and um just kind of letting everybody live right right in a not very good environment but this new company came in and they like i said they remodeled the place and it smells nice when you walk in and it looks nice and uh-huh they got like several new color TV's for the people and and redid the dining room where they made it you know a lot more interesting place for them to be they made a little patio area where they can go outside and huh uh-huh that's great yeah just you know small things that make it seem a lot more homely yeah yeah and it's like it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just uh horrible i would i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that and my biggest fear would that they would be is that they would be lonely right and i would like to know that there are you know just a lot of activities like you said you know just putting a plant in a room you know Just makes just brightens and and and just makes them just a little more active television right right uh-huh uh-huh they can go outside and just to know that they're not you know laying in a room looking at gray walls you know that that would right right with nothing you know that that's what would just really kill me i'd like to know that you know they have friends there and they you know have little conversations and things i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and yeah right right um maybe some kind of of activity little field trips or something i don't know how they would do that but right yeah well they uh this place that we visit it's really neat they have everyday they have schedules of groups that come in and uh-huh they will do bingo our group does a church service once a month and and then other groups come in and do the services you know other Sundays so that they have at least one service every Sunday and oh uh-huh wow so there are a lot of things there are places that have a lot of things for them to do but you really do have to kind of seek it out you know and uh-huh and make sure that it's not a place like this one was uh-huh i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that that's really neat that's really neat yeah yeah yeah it is it's real nice and um i know our church does it and there are a lot of other churches and they are just like civic organizations that do right uh-huh and uh i have other friends it's kinds of neat they take animals over and let the people pet them like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home and they will wash it all up and oh uh-huh make sure it's a friendly animal you know and take it in and let just let the old elderly people pet the dogs uh-huh that is great for that that will be something you know they would look forward to if they knew you know that the puppy is coming on Wednesday yeah yeah yeah yeah you know that would be something to look for that's really neat that really is yeah yeah i thought that was a real unusual thing for someone to do so uh-huh yeah there's a lot that can be done it's just a matter of people not being lazy uh-huh right and you know doing the best they can again i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother you know uh that would be yeah putting putting any of my family in an elderly home to me would be a the very last resort you know it right yeah um and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to to work or trying to take care of your own family it's kind of hard to right to to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent you know on you and i know that's hard sometimes and but it would really have to be a last resort because that would just i would feel so guilty uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah i would too just i don't know unless i knew that they were somewhere just really i mean just really great you know that they were really enjoying yeah right yeah yeah i know i know what you mean i don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home yeah well i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because um um many of them of course their minds are not good uh-huh and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story you know every time i visit them yeah yeah they'll tell me they'll reminisce about childhood and tell me something that they did and then the next time i go it's the same thing you know but uh-huh yeah just somebody to listen to them uh just seems to make them really feel good yeah uh-huh to nod their head and smile at them right i'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for there's a guy at this particular one i go to that i think that he's really an intelligent person but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate uh-huh uh-huh um and um he's blind and he has seizures you know i mean he's just like in a world of his own and yet he wants so much to be around people um right and if you come over to him if he can touch your hand he'll grab it and kiss it and oh he's always got a smile i mean he really tries to oh to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know oh that's something that i mean if i had to work in an elderly home i don't think i could do it yeah like i i would really like to be a teacher yeah but i don't think i could do it because i'm very very emotional me too and the minute i mean the minute something happens i mean i cry on i mean you know Hallmark commercials but i'm just that's just the end of me yeah uh-huh i know i know and so i mean something real life i just i'm i know i uh interview a lot of children i'm an education reporter uh-huh and i always go you know everyday i'm doing an education things and uh-huh i meet these kids who are you know dropping out of school left and right and all the sudden they're in this program they're making straight A's they're going to graduate early um um and i'm just i just want to hug them and go you are just fantastic and you know i could just imagine you know working in a home like that yeah yeah oh yeah and those people they're so sweet and and so genuine uh-huh uh-huh you know and all they want is just for everything to be happy and you know yeah yeah and so that would probably just tear me apart i mean in a good way but you know oh it does yeah yeah yeah it is it's really hard and uh-huh but one of the neatest things i think though is we always take our kids i have a three year old and a six year old and they um uh-huh have gotten comfortable being around these people because they've always gone with us uh-huh uh-huh and the people love them and i'm sure they want the children you know to hug them or hold their hand and so far my kids will do it just real easily uh-huh uh-huh and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little and they've never been afraid but that's something to me children yeah you know need to people need to take groups of children because the kids just brighten up their lives they right yeah yeah as we walk through the the lobby they'll all say bring her here i want to see her i would love to hold her and children i mean usually a lot of elderly people like to they like to uh share their experiences with the younger children they'll be telling them all kinds of stories that they don't even know what they mean but uh-huh yeah that's true you know they feel like they've lived life so they need to share it and i'm sure i'll be like that too yeah yeah well me too yeah yeah it's quite an experience but that's great i didn't know there were such groups yeah yeah there are and and uh it really helps those people i think uh-huh but like you said i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there yeah yeah it would be a last resort and i would hate it if anyone put me in one women oh i know i'm always afraid like oh no what if i lose my mind am i going to end up in a place like that yeah yeah somebody take care of me yeah that's right okay thus okay well okay well nice to talk to you yeah you too Tonya thanks for calling bye okay uh-huh bye-bye  do you have any favorite restaurants in the area oh yes i love uh Mexican and uh Oriental foods oh okay sounds great both so uh i could say Enchiladas down on Greenville Avenue in Dallas Texas i've been there is uh a real good Mexican and we like uh stir fry Hunan style over in Addison uh-huh have you ever tried the Blue Goose on Greenville Avenue oh yeah yeah i enjoy they serve a lot of food and good food in the Blue Goose yeah that is a good place where do you like to eat i usually go to El Chico once a week for lunch Thursdays Fridays whatever uh-huh favorite spot and uh China Market in uh Keystone oh yeah yeah that's good what what other kind of food interesting so oh i like just about everything uh sandwich shops uh Schlotzky's uh-huh uh restaurants that have a variety of food like uh Chili's or Bennigan's TGI Friday's uh-huh Schlotzky's is probably my favorite deli deli sandwich i guess because of the bread the uh roll uh-huh yeah i go to Galligaskins' too quite a bit uh-huh but uh yeah Schlotzky's is unique as they say different is better sounds good that's true that is true do you typically go out uh for lunch or for dinner well both uh probably eat out for dinner say once or twice a week uh-huh and i eat out for lunch probably three times a week yeah i usually hit the favorite lunch spots uh every week uh being El Chico and China Market so uh-huh sometimes Schlotzky's uh places like that during during lunch yeah uh i don't get out too much on the weekends but uh i'll occasionally go to an Italian restaurant or a Chinese restaurant uh-huh there is a new Italian restaurant that is really good uh on Greenville it's uh La Fontana or something like that it's right after you cross uh six thirty five on Greenville okay i've never been there it is actually the family has not been here even a year in the states uh-huh it's real authentic Italian food and their deserts are fabulous so if you like Italian that that's a really good place to go yeah i live up in Plano so i usually go to some place like uh A Taste of Italy uh-huh i haven't tried that is is it good uh yeah i think it's good it's uh because i live in Plano too okay i've been to uh Primavera also uh-huh i like that it's a little smaller and they don't have as large uh uh smoking a nonsmoking section to put it that way yeah uh so it it and it it gets gets quite crowded at at uh times especially on weekends yeah that means a lot to me too nonsmoking right yeah um let's see what was uh what about steaks steak oh yeah they opened up the Hoffbrau here about uh what two years ago in Plano where you use for a good steak uh-huh right and that's very good i take uh some some of my relatives there aunts and uncles a couple months ago to the Hoffbrau and they're dairy farmers so they're real picky about their steak but they were impressed uh-huh oh well that's good because i i know Steak and Ale is a favorite prime rib that they have is is usually what i get and uh-huh i was real pleased now i haven't had prime rib at the Hoffbrau but they don't i don't think they serve prime rib it's mostly just a steak shop uh Steak and Ale's a little more upscale than Hoffbrau really yeah yeah but the Hoffbrau's kind of neat in that they've got uh that market there too oh yeah and those uh shops with all the crafts so while you're waiting for uh for a seat you get to kind uh to browse around and see what what they've got in the farmer's market oh uh-huh yeah and from what i understand i know on the weekends passing there they have quite a wait they've got a wait even on weeknights uh usually between a half hour and forty five minutes well you really um so uh and it starts uh anywhere from from five o'clock on well what about fast food what do you grab you know say what's your favorite hamburger Wendy's as far as burgers uh yeah i like Wendy's uh i do not care for Burger King oh i cannot eat their Whoppers yeah uh McDonald's i avoid i used to work there as a teenager yeah so uh once you've worked in a place like that uh oh i don't know you don't i'm kind of reluctant to go back yeah i can understand that i know how the food is prepared yeah well i don't know Wendy's i think Wendy's tries to be more of a homemade burger so it's to me it's probably a little bit better you know an uh-huh maybe it's an adult hamburger yeah uh Arby's is good too except i don't care for the roast beef the chicken is good place uh-huh uh-huh well i like just about any kind of food i can usually i can eat anything any at anytime so usually whatever my friends want to go eat it suits me just fine an uh-huh they're opening up a new restaurant in about a month uh in Keystone called Razzoo's it's going to be a Cajun restaurant oh is that where the Flamingo was okay i noticed they were redoing that right same building Flang Flamingo used to be the Cactus before that oh gosh but the Flamingo never quite made it i went there one time an was not impressed uh-huh i've never been there now this new one is Razzoo's Razzoo's oh Cajun uh-huh well is that a chain or i don't think so um it it looks brand new in fact we stopped by one time at lunch to uh talk to the guy who is redoing it and uh he was real excited and gung ho huh uh-huh they've got their chef and their recipes all lined up and they're ready to start business well good deal but they're renovating the place right now it will take about another month i guess before they open up i'll have to try that what about that Italian there have you tried that uh-huh Eduardo's yeah i i went there a couple of times i was there for the grand opening uh-huh a friend of mine and myself were the second and third customers he had at that the restaurant oh my gosh but uh it's a little heavy for lunch yeah you get yeah too much pasta a lot of food uh-huh i i don't really care for that type of food for lunch yeah yeah so usually a sandwich uh maybe uh well El Chico once a week or once every other week something like that uh-huh soup yeah yeah Super Salads is a favorite place to hit too yeah Super Salads is good one of those things you got to go early you know to find a seat yeah yeah they get crowded real quick the crowd's a little dressier too more of a yuppie crowd yeah let's see uh fish as far as fish i think my favorite place is uh Dinger's over over on Forest Lane Dinger's i've never tried that okay oh it's very good very good matter of fact it's right by the TI plant that little shopping center okay it's pretty good and yeah i stop by uh oh what's the name of this place Long John Silvers every now and then yeah uh-huh for uh fish greasy fish great yeah yeah yeah but every now and then you get into the mood for something like that uh-huh also in the shopping center you know where BG's uh Zaks is that little craft shopping center yeah i sure do there's a a home if you want just like a plate you know home cooked meal that's good it's called BG's and every day they have like a plate lunch special and it's fairly cheap it's like two ninety five or three fifty uh-huh and it's real good so i don't think i've ever heard of that before that's oh it's just kind of a mom and pop restaurant that's uh vegetables like a couple vegetables and a meat an and roll and uh-huh quick usually really quick too so what do you think about Korean food i have never tried any there is a place called the Korean Rib on uh i think it's on Alma uh-huh or is it on Custer it's up here in Plano anyway uh-huh and uh it's very good i uh really thought it was well it's it's a lot like Chinese food i was going to say how does it compare are the spices different um i it well they have different dishes uh it's not so much just a lot of rice with uh with something dumped on top they uh uh-huh uh they've they've got more type uh specialty type uh meals i guess you'd say oh okay more like an entree yeah uh and and vegetable uh-huh something like that yeah okay okay i've also tried uh a Korean restaurant in Dallas uh i can't remember what it's called but they have a dish called uh B Bim Bap B Bim Bap it's uh vegetables with uh fried egg on top how wild that and uh Mongolian beef yeah typical dishes there okay well what about Indian have you tried Indian i uh haven't let's see i think i've been in an Indian restaurant one time and they uh i i really don't care for curry that much yeah i have a friend that goes frequents she frequents and Indian place over there by The Blue Ribbon Cafe okay i don't know where that is either i'm sure oh it's uh right there in Richardson on the west side of seventy five uh-huh and uh she i've never got the courage to go but that's once a week place for her sounds different so yeah well what about TI's cafeteria do you ever uh yeah i eat there quite a quite a bit usually chicken fried steak uh oh gosh mashed potatoes and cream gravy yeah that's the only thing that's safe i used to eat the Mexican food but i lost the taste for that yeah yeah the burrito you can only handle every so often uh-huh sandwiches are okay but there are better places to go the prices are not that cheap at the cafeteria yeah right it uh so not  so have you got a pet no i don't my kids would love a pet i had a pet when i was a girl i had a Cocker Spaniel and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company you can you can tell them anything and they won't tell anybody yeah that's right that's like unconditional affection right as a matter of fact i was thinking that same thing unconditional love they just give it and don't expect too much anyway do you have a pet yeah i had a cat i've had several cats my cat uh was hit by a car New Year's Eve but uh i'm gonna get another one as soon as i oh get back in town i'm going out of town this weekend when i get back i'm gonna find a cat oh i'm so sorry but that's good that you're gonna get another one i know some of my friends who have pets uh and they just are really so yeah you know the ones who have dogs are very uh protective of them and i think that's one reason they have them especially older people that i know that have pets but they just um really take care of them are and are protective of them yeah i work and go to school and it's kind of nice you know you come home your your pet's there for you and wants to wants a little food a little attention yeah and and like my kids um they really want a dog badly and that's it's kind of fun and they've been looking and looking and want you know they'd take anything i think but um i don't know do you like i guess your cat was an indoor cat yeah no it was an indoor kind of indoor outdoor it a kind of traveled around traveled it was well yeah i don't i don't care for the smell of a litter box so my cat was trained to go outside other than that it was inside when it wanted to be it was outside when you know it yeah when i had a Cocker Spaniel it it was an outdoor dog and uh i think i liked that better uh-huh yeah i i i think you know i like dogs but i think that uh i'm i'm kind of like big dogs big dogs and you have to have room for them yeah that's true and dogs take a lot of a lot more care than cats do cats are pretty independent you know you feed them and they keep themselves clean and yeah that's true if you if you raise them right you know you don't have to worry about the litter box thing where with dogs you really do have to let them out and take them for walks and take them for walks right things like that yeah i see all the people on on Sunday going for a walk with their dogs and and i i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog i'm like i know it'll be fun the first week maybe and then mom gets to take care of it or something so i guess yeah yeah i got to take care a friend of mine's dog he's just got a puppy and he was out of town last weekend and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet so it's go over there and clean up after the dog and um-hum oh that's exciting that's that's a major chore you know if you don't if you don't keep up with it and uh kids kind of they want the they want the fun part and not the not the work yeah yeah i think it's really important to that that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that you know we're not just going on with this pet population and having to just get rid of them that that kind of gripes on me some but yeah but i don't know more and more people are aware well if you're if you're gonna have a pet and not have it neutered or spayed you need to be willing to you know deal with the consequences take care of the offspring and right right but uh and i think you know when i was growing up we had cats cats and you know just seeing the cats you know the the the miracle of birth you know put that in quotes is that's a that's a neat thing to to experience as a kid and understand and and it was a real positive thing but on the other hand you don't wanna i think that's really true you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road you know they're they're they're getting old now and it's time to get rid of them so yeah yeah exactly exactly i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too and and that's good too yeah well i think that's all i have to say okay have a good night all right bye-bye okay well it's good talking to you yeah bye  all right you know like you said i haven't uh been keeping track of what all has been going on in uh Central America myself um and uh well other than the Nicaraguan situation where we kicked out the dictator of that country and his case is yet to come to trial and all that um-hum i can't say that i've kept up too much with it i know that the Colombians for awhile we were trying to do something to give them the incentive to get out of the drug trade and there was a lot of assassinations and killings and that sort of thing going on down there because they were trying to clean up the mobster crowd yeah uh but uh other than that uh the only thing i ever hear about a country like Brazil or some place like that is advertisements to come enjoy their their beaches and the like and what is it Rio de Janeiro yeah yeah yeah i know what is it your talking about um i've i've listened to a lot of things going on i mean uh the Manuel Noriega Panama thing i think was probably the right thing to do i mean the guy was just blatantly going out and shooting Americans um-hum and uh so i think what they did there was right i'm not so sure about uh what they're doing in some of the countries where we're supporting guerillas that are fighting the communists um-hum you know that are in there uh because it never seems to really work we end up throwing in money and a lot of people getting killed and when push comes to shove we seem to back out on the gorillas like we did the Kurds back uh in the late seventies yeah and so that that that kind of thing concerns me um it's the things that we're not doing that we should be doing like right now there's a big outbreak of uh of course it's a little further south in South America but there's an outbreak of uh uh what is it cholera in uh Peru and all so it's gotten into Columbia now um-hum um-hum and it looks like it's going to be pretty serious uh thing there they're talking about it lasting for ten years yeah that's right yeah i heard about that that's supposed to be sweeping on up through to the uh Central American American countries too yeah and it's it's already gotten into into Brazil a little bit and it has to do with the fact that uh i mean in that part of the world they just dump raw sewage right into the rivers i mean things that we don't do here anymore because we know how bad it is for you um-hum um-hum um-hum yet they're they're you know they're steadily steadily doing it down there and their filtration systems i guess haven't kept up with the pace and it they actually don't have filtration systems uh some of the major cities do oh um but for the most part most of those countries flat out pump it right into the rivers and let it float on down and pump it right out into the ocean oh um um um and that's you know that's how they deal with it and you know they're just steadily polluting that part of the part of the world that way um-hum um um the other thing is the uh economic assistance uh right now we're starting we're starting to talk about having free trade with Mexico right and my God this is something we should have done years ago and Mexico is our closest neighbor they've been in financial trouble for years um-hum and i think we've exploited them i mean when i was in Texas i noticed that uh you know you think of Texas and you have good meat and fresh vegetables and all that um-hum well most of the vegetables they sold in Texas came from Mexico and so did the meat um-hum the meat that was raised in Texas they sent back east to sell because they had get more money for it um-hum um and uh well i don't think uh i i agree with you i think you're right we have exploited but i i think that the leadership that Mexico has had up until for some phenomenally lucky reason has been a rather than corrupt um feudalistic type of leadership everybody sort of on the take sort of like the way uh the uh uh what what was that bunch that used to run the Philippines yeah The Marcos yeah yeah so that sort of thing and the guy they got in this last time uh he for once is a tried and true and really you know outright capitalist from the word go um-hum and he wants to take the government off the peoples backs and really get free enterprise on started and i was reading i think in Newsweek or Time or one of those or US News World Reports one of those mags that uh uh they were having a tough time with the peasant farmer situation being able to compete with uh American farming industry because we have these huge conglomerates right well he went out using the governments uh uh finances or or whatever you call it he went out and and gathered together a lot of the farmers who had small farms inside one another and he pulled together sort of like a a commune um-hum but yet he let's them each be a free enterprise uh uh person but they work together in terms of what they organize to grow and they grow massive amounts of things that are common to each other in certain areas and yet they vary their crops in such a way that they they uh can be very productive in how many much of these crops they make but they can also roll them over and then they market it altogether as a group as a force um-hum and as a result uh it said that since they started the program of course it went sort of kind of kind of uh rough at first but apparently since they got the program going that they uh the amount of money and the uh uh profit and standard of living that they're able to to reap from it has gone up almost tenfold from this that's great and so uh this guy may be actually going to finely turn the uh the country on i mean it's always been tough for the southern or or lower latitude countries to be as productive as the higher latitude countries to be as productive as some reason another and as the higher latitude countries i've often wondered if that does have something to do with the the climate being uh so warm that it tends to make work harder to do um-hum i don't know but it does seem like that there has always been a preponderance of countries in the middle latitude zones that uh uh seem to always lack in their ability to to develop industrially uh as well as even agriculturally yeah yeah that that that probably has some bearing on it i don't know um also there's uh a uh tradition of just doing enough to get by um yeah yeah they're they're not as motivated as uh as we are and right people farther south um-hum um now you know once you you get down into Chile and Argentina and those kinds of areas i mean their climates are pretty much the same as ours um-hum yeah and and they have been uh they have had spurts at times i know i think it was Chile uh that has been fairly capitalistic that have has spurts of times when they did rather well and then they sort of reverse because they have some sort of a military take over or something like that and they go into a dictatorship for awhile and yeah and it would just sort of go downhill but uh uh i don't know that that they don't seem to be able to keep any particular stable regime for any particular long period of time in their capitalistic type governments yeah and while we're sitting here talking about it i'm thinking you know we know every darn thing that goes on everyday in Europe yeah you know i mean we know what's going on in Poland we know what's going on in Romania we know the Germanies are getting back together we didn't you know we all know what's going in Europe um-hum but we never here anything about what's going on down in South you know in South and Central America yeah unless they have a coffee strike or the drug problem gets out of uh proportion like it did for awhile or unless we're sending thousands of troops down there to kick somebody's butt i mean that's right or or unless they're kicking the British's butts like they did in the Falkland Islands something like that where it involves one of our allies yeah yeah we just don't pay any attention to them then you're you're right and um i wonder why that is yeah it's it's you know it's it just doesn't make any sense i mean we're in the same uh hemisphere spo to speak i mean you know the same side of the earth i mean could it possibly be because of they're they're little third world countries and they are all independent from one another where as if they had of somehow or another from their past history formed into a larger country like our continental United States did and uh developed uh uh a free enterprise capitalistic type of economy with a common form of government that they could have uh uh been a force in the world though yeah i don't know i i i ask what what went wrong what was different they certainly have the climates in the southern hemisphere uh uh to have been easily as productive and i certainly think they have rich enough land i don't think uh the continental of South America as i recall my geography that's been along time ago as being any particularly different or or lacking in terms of agricultural or industrial or river yeah rivers that were naturally there or so forth that they could not have developed developed a uh a pretty uh uh uh by today's standards modern type of economy yeah yeah i mean it doesn't it really doesn't make sense to me i don't know you know it's i mean they've never really been a real force in the world i mean uh we heard about Argentina only when it tried to take over the Falcons and England had to go down there and kick their butt yeah um-hum um-hum um so it's it's like really strange that we never pay that much attention i i you know i just find myself lacking in in a lot of knowledge about South America um-hum um-hum i'd like to think i know a lot about a lot of things but you know i have something is amiss here as far as the amount of information that's available um-hum um-hum uh i don't know if it's intentional on the part of you know the the powers that be or whether no body really cares i think that's kind of it i mean i certainly don't tend to think about it like out of the site out of mind uh myself uh in general unless there's some sort of a controversial thing going on that either affects me or the country at large one way or the other politically  all right okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um we're from San Antonio and that's where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night okay oh uh-huh uh-huh and Monterey sits um right on the coast and i don't know if your familiar with the um the California coastline but we're we're about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco oh okay and it's uh really nice uh it's a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan and Germany and England and they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches so it's it's pretty nice uh year round but um cool always cool in the evenings and uh warm in the warm in the summer but it's stays pretty cool even uh during the winter for as nice as it is uh-huh and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four o'clock and it kind of rolls in over the coast and uh then it usually breaks back off again uh the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in i'd i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas uh it the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and uh the fog never makes it that far but along here it's uh very very uh different from the the Texas type weather hum so what's it like down there well right now we're having the the little bit of spring that we have yeah oh really well at least you've got some we we don't have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually uh-huh uh spring usually consists of a lot of rain excuse me especially thunderstorms i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight oh well that's good and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days uh-huh so it's have y'all been having any heat waves or uh it's gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times like the ninety degree uh-huh uh but basically been in the the low seventies and eighties uh-huh oh well that's good for this time of year yeah it's not really been too bad because usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier uh-huh uh-huh oh do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff up there yeah quite a bit in fact the the season well the season's just about over for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week oh i bet uh-huh and uh there there were still some indian paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way oh i miss i miss that funny we drove through San Antonio and i spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio yeah we're they had that we came back what day was that Sunday evening and they had a a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing we're getting now i guess oh yeah well that's real nice because i can remember um two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued so at least y'all are getting some rain up in Dallas i'm glad to hear that yeah this that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well uh-huh y'all weren't getting any of the strings of uh the tornadoes and stuff were you um we had a few down here but but not anything like Kansas and this is the season for that uh-huh oh okay oh gosh they do they do pop up occasionally around here uh-huh oh yeah i really don't miss all the heat here it's i'm getting acclimated to having the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief yeah yeah i'm i'm from here originally so July and August i'm pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures and stuff uh-huh yeah the the biggest problem with with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the the soil it's that black clay soil oh is that what Dallas is okay yeah it's kind of sandy you know it's not sandy like most of the state is so it doesn't absorb the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit it's uh-huh it's filled up and everything else just runs off so um-hum yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come it's a complete it's a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didn't realize that Dallas had that same problem yeah yeah we have it especially especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years there's a uh there's a section in South Dallas that has had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain huh golly well we could use some rain up here we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought really up here and they they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasn't enough to offset what they had lost over the last four years huh and uh so they're still talking water rationing this summer so uh it would seem strange because in San Antonio um we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville uh-huh and the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down and they were considering um that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and there's no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in you know in the four year drought so i said well gee this is pretty much like Texas and it pretty much is in the middle of summer they have rolling hills around here but uh-huh uh-huh um they they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green hm yeah but um it's a really nice area uh it's just it's just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and was used to essentially like you said you have the cold winter and then you have the hot uh-hum summer spring and uh to come here it's kind of the the temperate weather all year round it's kind of like um spring i guess if you uh year round um-hum except and then in the the winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones huh uh-huh yeah huh but it is it's a really nice uh change of pace i guess i'd prefer that yeah to the to the heat i really don't miss the heat um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff out yeah it's just so much easier up here and you don't have to worry about the high high humidity does Dallas get high humidity um-hum yeah we we it's pretty dry we get some when it's this rainy but it's nothing like i guess San Antonio summers it's nothing like Houston or is it pretty dry uh-huh for instance it'd be or east Texas is a little more humid yeah it seems like San Antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more humid and here it's uh well it's right by the ocean but um it's not the same as at Corpus at Corpus you you get that humid salty huh feeling in the air but here um the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit uh-huh um and a thick wet suit at that because it's just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess it's because of that cold uh ocean uh water that the air is always cool it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area and uh we just hadn't expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to Pacific coast weather it's just completely different and it's much nicer yeah yeah probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference in that so uh-huh it does and the um the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so it's a nice change so we'll be here a couple of years and we thought well we'll take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like that's nice and uh so it's been good yeah my wife's originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesn't it um parts do we uh we were over in the in the western edge in the mountains oh and they have of course some pretty severe storms uh winter storms snow and that type of thing uh-huh uh-huh but they're so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesn't usually bother you very much uh-huh yeah not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still you know uh yeah and and their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real real hot there uh-huh oh yeah i'll have to try that out because i had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that uh-huh and uh i've just never really been in that region of the country and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like because a lot of people that are from that North Carolina region really like it and uh they like they get the snow but they said it doesn't really get messy and it doesn't really hang around that long and yeah uh they the people i know that are from there uh they always miss it and they want to go back nothing seems quite as good yeah but anyway um-hum well funny as we were talking the weather came on and there's a flash flood watch and well oh gee whiz more rain for the next three or four days oh gosh oh well i hope it moves up this way but i'm sure it won't yeah maybe we can send you some yeah because we could sure use it okay well you think that takes care of the the time and i think that'll do it okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh well i enjoyed talking with you Lisa yeah good luck to you okay we'll see you um bye uh-huh you too bye bye  yes um how how do you feel about uh way the US has reacted in the Middle East well i i i was uh it was favorable i i just uh i think the sanctions would have worked uh but it would have taken longer and uh now with all this stuff coming out with Woodward's book and everything uh and then i saw a Nightline program last night about all the uh funding of uh Hussein uh back as early as eighty nineteen eighty six so uh has there been a different turn and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen uh after the war well it got over so fast so uh um-hum what is the Woodward book you are referring to well it uh just came out uh i guess yesterday it's called the Commanders and it's uh it says um big story in the paper about it today Bush trying to comment on it that uh Colin Powell was uh was against uh an early uh he he was for sanctions um-hum and so it seems like there's you know always somebody digging things like that but i'm not for sure we know exactly what what all happened in that situation so uh um-hum um-hum we we were so uh fast to get over the Vietnam whatever the Vietnam syndrome is that i i'm afraid now we've tied ourselves up there in the Middle East for a long period of time right that was that's my feeling i was i was very against our involvement so so quickly and um uh i yeah i just think the i think if we had been very i i mean if he had that good of a correlation through the United Nations then they could have uh they they could have made sanctions work i'm pretty sure uh with that much support you would have just penalized any nation that uh broke the embargo um-hum um-hum right i think we're very naive as far as that part of the world's concerned we are we are i think uh you know in in uh we've just misread almost everything in that we always seem to be getting in bed with the wrong fellow for the next next tenure or next thing down the road and uh then we can and we don't seem to read Israel correctly so uh i don't know it should be a mess it's uh not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon right right in spite of all the promises so right that they they can talk a good game but uh being a historian it's uh you know you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all of the mess after first world war um-hum um-hum and we just uh we're still very i i uh you're you're absolutely right too naive um we just if we do find so-called experts to in in any area of the world we don't listen to them so um-hum um-hum um i don't know be be interesting to keep watching i guess but i'm just afraid it's going it's going to break us um-hum and i'm i'm not sure we're sensitive to to other cultures so not very much uh in in our colleges we're trying we're i happen to teach at college with tremendous number of international students and and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand and it's uh it needs to be uh taught from the earliest grades with our school systems in such disarray i don't know if that it doesn't look terribly hopeful um-hum um-hum but i'm not sure it's something you can teach i mean well you can at least uh give give uh uh give them the awareness of the different cultures and uh you know have all sorts of um at at least you know let them know what awareness maybe that that other people do things differently than than than maybe in their own neighborhood um-hum um-hum so and and when when when those people are around if they if you can get them to meet then we're all pretty much alike um-hum that's true that's true so uh yeah but it's uh it's something as you know as i said won't go away so uh it'll be a good topic for me in the class for a long time since i teach history so right and um what about the whole situation with with the refugees the Kurds well i would just think if Bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the United Nations to um uh somehow persuade those nations to give the Kurds a a homeland they were promised that nineteen uh nineteen and that um but what about the Palestinians then well that's the same thing they uh they haven't been waiting quite as long even though they've been waiting since forty eight uh that right that that becomes a different matter simply because you're dealing with Israel and and they seem to be more intractable than ever um-hum um-hum uh that Shamir can't can't retain his leadership if he if he backs down the slightest bit so uh i just don't see us uh you know i don't think there's anybody of of major stature on the scene of like some of the great statesman of the past um-hum or at least we thought they were i'm not for sure that they were they they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes but um-hum well do you think the US should even be involved i mean as as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve the issues or should we have just stayed out of it well well i wish we could stay out of it but but the oil's not going to allow us to we absolutely need that oil that's the major thing if we didn't need the oil and and if we didn't have the ties with the Israelis we could probably stay out of it um-hum um-hum um right right but i'm not for sure that we're we're not destined at least for the foreseeable future as long as we can keep our head our own head above water to be the the world's leader um-hum um so i Bush is probably if if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and and and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money um they may just have to i don't know what type pressure they can put on uh all the nations there too because now that the war's over the societies have gone back just about to their own um-hum um-hum uh cold selves and uh i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the Kuwaitis they uh they're nobody likes them in that part of the world uh but it's it's just such a um-hum um-hum such a volatile uh area i mean there's just no stability there period that's what's right but but in a sense i don't know that i i that i would say it's good but in i'm sense in a sense i'm glad that Saudi wasn't more changed by by the situation because i mean we really don't um-hum i mean i don't think it's our role to westernize the whole world so the fact that that Saudi could just sort of pull back and and and remain you know culturally sort of clean is is interesting absolutely not no yeah i think you're right i it's not our uh role to make everybody like us um-hum uh yeah but it's just uh for those who who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world uh that are up in the age i am it's going eliminate that for awhile i just don't think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there right right well you know i mean i i actually lived in Beirut from sixty eight to seventy to eighty four and so i mean it's it's been dangerous for sometime i'm not sure that it and it's you know changed that much oh did you yes yeah well uh i i i i haven't been to Beirut but i've heard what a wonderful city that's just totally gone to uh ruin well see that's it it really hasn't but but exactly it depends whether your talking whether one talks physical or or sort of um cultural culturally i mean it obviously changed a lot it hasn't well see that's what we get from um-hum uh because it's more a survival city but but the buildings are still intact it's still beautiful you know there's there was garbage on the corners when i got there and there's garbage when i left but i mean this is just a different uh cultural aspect i mean the trucks don't come daily and and you really don't want the garb age in your house so oh okay sure yeah and i mean i traveled extensly extensively in the area too and um so that you know many of the countries Turkey and Syria are still the same as they were before for traveling right okay okay um right i that's one part of the world i've i've been to north Africa a lot but not um i haven't been to Beirut or or Syria or Israel or uh Baghdad i would love to go there yeah i was never able to go to Baghdad it was i never could get a visa so even before i mean even when things were good in the Middle East Americans weren't really given visas to Baghdad yeah right and um but it's it's a very beautiful part very interesting historically of course which was my interest is art history right sure oh yeah so um yeah well i think we've done them a good job today then for this little project they're doing right right in fact i just talked to the director awhile ago so uh he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because i've been so busy with this presidential search i haven't had a chance to really do any calling myself uh-huh i see i see well great and um you know have a good business trip so uh anyway thank you and you continue your fine trip bye-bye okay thank bye-bye  all right i guess our i we're in the process of a home repair right at this point because we're we're painting the outside of our house i don't know i guess that's you would consider that a home repair certainly uh um-hum uh and interesting enough this time we're changing the color which makes uh an addition uh we've what does your most recent oh we just barely did that too you did that recently too huh make does it make a big difference yes oh yes we have brick on the outside and uh it the colors that were there changed the and the colors we painted changed the entire look of the house completely that's neat isn't it nah yes it was really exciting it was fun i was really uh really tired of the color and it's it's it's helping we're not quite through but it's it really is looking good uh we went through a process of of uh home repairs on a on a rental house we had probably the most uh extensive and uh the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do um didn't have very much money and so we had to to do it ourselves in a kind of a slow process but we learned how to do uh retile bathtubs and and um oh just all kinds of things that are kind of unusual um-hum well the other thing that we did was the roof of our house and uh we did that a different color also of course uh ah yeah being a woman most of these things were done by uh the men and uh so i wasn't directly involved but uh um-hum they really were helpful i know to our house it's nice to not have a drip through from the ceiling from the roof isn't it yes yes that's awful um uh Howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in uh in connection with Scouting you got a Scouter uh coming up and uh uh i think it's neat for for young people to learn how to uh take care of their of of a household you know like uh fixing faucets and drippy faucets and putting in panes of glass and stuff like that that's right well as a matter of fact one thing uh i have a young son and one thing we did was we had paneling on the inside of our uh front of our house or the hallway of our house rather and we were repainting the the front room in the hall there and we took down that paneling and he helped me and and uh he was it it was fun to work with him um-hum and uh and help putty up the holes together and and do things like that he was a how did the how did the paneling paneling looks lots better do you do you like it better oh i like it so much better it makes it so much lighter you know it really um yeah yeah yeah you know and people who have been to my house before and and then now really have liked it much much better too so it's been fun yeah that's nice isn't it nice to have it come out to uh uh positive and look look good yeah yeah exactly yeah well we have a lot that needs to be done we have uh we have uh carpeting and and uh we did have a a new uh floor put in our kitchen and um i have my mother living with us and so she was in a a room with a carpet and course she's quite aged she's ninety three now so that meant she had problems now and then and it it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a a linoleum down so it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was and so that was a really positive uh uh it was fairly expensive though i'm i was impressed i think that uh we we had somebody do it and and it was it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet hm that's interesting kind of depends on the on the quality of carpet i suppose but yeah uh in in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and and fix the floor so it's uh i don't know whatever but they have to put stuff on the floor and it's uh kind of a process so oh i bet it does well it sounds like you've had some pretty good experiences with uh with uh um home repair uh-huh we have it's been really fun yeah all right happy home repairing okay bye-bye well okay you too bye-bye  okay tell me about your home well it's an older home it was made back in the early sixties it's a pier beam house uh-huh uh-huh got three bedrooms one bath and that just makes me scream that's pretty tough what area do you live in i live in Houston oh okay i see is that pretty typical for your area well for the neighborhood i'm in yeah this is one this is one of the more uh established neighborhoods it is uh-huh that sounds really interesting i live in a suburb of Dallas and um i live in the basic three bedroom two bath home so at least i have two bathrooms that's not so bad but uh it's pretty typical for the area as well um i've always been interested in older homes personally so it's i think you can end up you can end up doing more with them it seems like what is it what about uh yard space do you have lot of uh a big lot or anything like that well the whole the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre oh i see well half about half of that about a quarter acre of that i've got a garden hum-um oh that's nice because i have just a like a very small you know those basic tract houses like that we have a very small yard and um i do have garden but it's it's extremely small but uh it seems like though for your area that's that's sort of different in a big city like that most houses i would think would be sort of like uh what we live in just a you know a basic tract house well in the um newer neighborhoods development communities that they've put together the houses are so close together if your neighbors having an argument you can hear it blow for blow yeah that's exactly right that's the way we are we have uh one thing that we really do enjoy is we have a hot tub in the back so we have we have quite a few parties and uh it seems like everyone that lives around us ends up you know hearing every conversation that goes on outside you know with everyone so uh that's true that's one thing that i don't enjoy about it is the houses are too close together but uh you know it's it's fine for now hopefully eventually we'll move into a larger home the only thing that i don't like also is that the the rooms are so small you know it's it's very difficult to arrange furniture and and things like that so are are the rooms in your house bigger since it's a a sixties home it seems like then that they built the rooms much larger is that true and they've got better closet space than most of the new houses that i've seen yeah yeah yeah that's really it that's a plus at least we do have uh like three walk-in closets here so that's that's maybe not so so typical but uh it helps a bunch yeah it really does except when you you know have to fill them up and then you get those Visa bills in and so anyway um anything else about the area about um you know that it compare can you can compare your house to anything around there most of the neighborhood i'm in is pretty typical this whole neighborhood was kind of built in between sixty and sixty five yeah so it's just it's just so everybody's got a usually a pretty good size yard i think i've got probably the biggest yeah if not the biggest yard i've got pretty close to it in the entire neighborhood yeah that's nice that is nice but you know too the only bad thing about that is then you have to keep up you know you have well that's the yard to deal with and i enjoy that though do you you must have more time than than i have i'm sitting out here right now we had this terrible rain and i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten and it seems like now that's that's i almost wish i was in an apartment or something you know praying for rain down here but uh yeah well um i don't know do we just terminate this or or do you have to talk for a a certain amount of time do you know no we can the after you go to i think its five somewhere between five and ten minutes they'll get a little master recording on here that okay okay well can you tell me anything else about the house are you working on it i mean do do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation yeah this entire neighborhood everybody keeps the places up real nice yeah that's that's nice yeah the the town that i came from is uh is a uh older town and it's like the typical the typical homes there are like you know early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds wow and i renovated a house there and that was you know that was so much fun i mean there if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy five to hundred years old you know you're just you're just nobody practically and that was really it that was a good experience for me you learn a lot of discipline and and uh that was what considered typical for that area so uh it it's it was quite a change for me to come to a house like this now that's just you know a very square little box and you know there's not there's not a whole lot you can do with it but uh anyway living in the city living in the city has some advantages but given the choice i'm getting out yeah that's true oh really well i had lived in a small town for you know this this town was like less than ten thousand people and it was about sixty miles south of Dallas and i you know i didn't move out of there until i was you know twenty seven and out that was just you know so i i love the big city because you know i had lived in a rural area for for so long so i've enjoyed it but uh it can get it can get kind of tough it is like a rat race sometimes that's just something i'll never adapt to i don't i don't want to be a part of the rat race i want to be basically just kind of left alone if i want to if i want to sit around and mess mess with my garden i'll mess with my garden if i want to work in the flower beds fine yeah yeah yeah it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well i i really yeah i really do enjoy that i haven't planted anything yet or very much you know i usually have got flowers coming out the gazoo but i've i haven't done that yet i've had finals this week so uh uh oh you know i'm just kind of been trying to trying to uh stick in with that but uh since that's over with now maybe i can i can get this yard in shape do you do a lot of gardening uh landscaping more than the garden the gardening i've got my beans peas i've got some onions out yeah yeah yeah tomatoes i'm not real sure what they're going to do this year i never have much luck with tomatoes i do i do plant a lot of beans because it seems like the the uh bugs get on them so easily and i have a real problem with anything pesticide like pesticides or anything like that so the only thing that i use is soapy water you know spray the plants because they say supposedly that will keep the bugs off them but uh i don't have luck with that on tomato plant so i hate to spray them with anything um what do you do do you have any tips you could give me um my favorite one is putting on the um tomato plant is to put uh seven dust yeah yeah and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time and that's true that's true i've my dad is a farmer so you know i've heard him talk about that forever i guess it works but um you have to really wash your vegetables after that so it won't make you sick let's see what else do you do to your house well i've done some rewiring on it yeah eventually i'm gonna have if if we stay here i'm gonna have to rewire the entire house oh really do you plan on uh like adding any rooms or you have enough space you could probably do that or is it i've talked well i've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on yeah i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms that's that's tough that's really tough do you not like have a half bath not even a half bath yeah yeah that's that's rough the house that i used to live in had like one bath and a half and that was even just with two people that was a pain the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at different totally different times that's good so that it's not like we're tripping over each other in the morning trying to get ready really that that could account for a lot of marital problems i think you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom yes it doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on and you're both fighting over the mirror no that's right it's it's not it does not make for a for a happy situation that's true well do you have any children got one one child and they enjoy they enjoy where they're living we'll he's nine months old now oh so he doesn't know right i guess he's a big help out in your garden right uh he he likes to dig around a little bit then his mother comes in and says how why did you let him play in the dirt like i said he was enjoying himself yeah that's right it's healthy why not as long as he wasn't eating the dirt i wasn't to worry about it yeah nah it won't hurt them i i was a big dirt eater supposedly when i was a child and i turned out okay so don't worry about it just let him enjoy himself so you think that you want to move away from the big city huh well that's what i've always i was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people yeah so you're just the opposite from me you want to go back to that huh and then after you're getting married move ended up moving to Houston the Houston area yeah yeah so are you from Texas or you are yes so it's not you know that's that's true Houston in itself is a pretty tough place you  okay great um currently i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program uh-huh i'm mainly do a lot of walking um i have a son that's a little bit overweight and um the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around so my wife and i kind of take turns um at one time i had a a fairly regular exercise program but in the last couple of months i've changed to a a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned upside down all this space that uh normally would be dedicated towards the exercise area is uh covered in boxes yeah um what did you do when you exercised when you did exercise regularly well i had a a a little routine that i i did for uh warm ups and then i did some uh very uh-huh mild mild say light weight lifting nothing and i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles just trying to try stay as firm as i can stay in my old age uh-huh yeah um well right now um i try to when it's nice out it's been raining a lot this spring but i try to i have a bicycle and i like to cycle a lot and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in Texas i don't know if it's up north but um-hum like every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally and uh thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles which that's a lot of fun um so we try to ride ride during the week to stay in shape for that um-hum and um TI where i work has uh a fitness center so a lot of times after work or maybe on the weekend we'd go over there and lift weights and do the treadmill and um they have stair masters and all kinds of new machines that are fun to ride and and workout on so i try to i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis i used to get into it and then get out of it based on my schedule so i'm trying to stay in in shape on a regular basis now but it's a big commitment we don't have any kids yet so that's a lot of the part of it yeah that's that's that's a plus uh i have a total of five children i have three left living at home uh-huh and they do take up a big part of my uh my evening and weekend yeah and it's tough being a parent and trying to do all the things that you should do for yourself too yeah it's uh something they don't tell you about when you're growing up yes when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children uh-huh that's why uh they they uh really stress um at TI they really stress staying in shape but like in staying fit overall fitness you know no smoking and all that but it's it's hard to find uh a actual exercise regimen that works for you you know because like i know a lot of people that cycle they take their kids behind them on the bikes and i don't know if that would work for me because um-hum i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain but you know it's really hard to find something that works and it you know to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever i think maybe walking or running would probably work because you it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever yeah yeah well there's you you have to uh what i found from my experiences you have to budget time for yourself uh-huh and then uh the you you can use what ever rationale you want but basically the healthier you stay the longer you'll live right and uh you know if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer well then i'll be around a lot longer those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now well you know get the enjoyment of me years past where i would have been if i hadn't taken it uh-huh so if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that it works out fine yeah um i've been learning a lot lately about um i've been reading a book by Kenneth Cooper i don't know if you're familiar are familiar with him um he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really he's kind of redid um uh just pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing um and he was talking about the three things you could that cause aging are smoking inactivity and what was the other one i think it was yeah obesity so if you can control those three areas then you are going to live longer you know because those are risk factors so anyway it's kind of a tip yeah oh i've done a lot of study over the years and i found that uh probably one of the worst things that uh anybody can ingest is chlorinated water really yeah um the research i've done and uh i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty three and um-hum it's it's amazing that uh you know like prior to like nineteen twenty there were not very few heart attacks um-hum there were none prior to nineteen hundred well in nineteen oh three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water and then after that we started having the hearts attacks man and uh Dr Price wrote a book Coronarys Cholesterol and Chlorine you can usually find it at a health food store um-hum i know they had it in health food stores in Plano i used to live in Plano Dr Price that's uh Dr Price yeah and it's amazing he makes the in you know it's a very small book and the guy's very opinionated um but he makes a very good case against chlorine there were no heart attacks before we started using it and he says points out that people in uh England and uh or eating diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now um-hum and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks and that's really interesting yeah he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours uh-huh and uh proved that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis which is the clogging of the arteries and uh yeah you know he's uh there's been a lot of reports since then and this whole thing about you know first it was stress then they went to cholesterol and now they're saying what's cholesterol well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol and um-hum you know it's it's it's amazing what he points out in that book and that um in fact he even uh there was a uh toxicologist for the Environmental Protection Agency who did work back in nineteen eighty six who wrote a letter to Dr Price in nineteen eighty seven and in this letter he praised Dr Price for the work he did back in the sixties on this hm and said that the EPA had been doing experiments on non human primates and proving that ingestation of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis and EPA never published that report and what's the name of this book again uh Coronaries Cholesterol and Chlorine i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart yeah yeah and he's in fact he's a well heart too i mean he's uh he's done a lot of research on like how your heart re reacts reacts to exercise sorry he just made me laugh um uh-huh so anyway i have to remember that yeah there's there's a there's a lot of good information out there uh about health and a lot of the uh a lot of the myths they've been passing around people are are starting to realize aren't true i mean i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that because that's that's good for you yeah um-hum uh but to to believe some of the things that they you know and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high high fat diet but to think that that solely alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is hum-um it's just hard to believe if you get a chance read Dr Cooper's book on controlling cholesterol um-hum that's a real good um he talks about that talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that yeah i actually eat pretty much anything that i want that's right uh-huh and i've had my cholesterol checked and uh you know a few times and i've never been above uh like a hundred and fifty never uh-huh and uh uh i mean i you have a good ratio of good to bad cholesterol um you you well what they tell me but i mean you know everything's like within uh five to ten percent and all that kind of thing you know they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued yeah huh but uh we've uh i work at the TI site in Hunt Valley Maryland oh really yeah and we've had a few of the health fairs up here and you know i've always come out aces that's good and i'm you know i'm not really that big on on watching what i eat i i do eat you know some health cookies that are high in fiber and yeah low in fat and all that kind of stuff but i mean as far as being really concerned about ingesting too much uh chlorine i'm not or cholesterol i'm not worried about  all right Betty uh what do you think about air pollution what all you know about it well i guess i've uh just i've listened a lot to the media and i've tried to read some things on it and i've tried to take some steps to uh understand it and figure out where i am in the whole mess uh-huh um apparently it's getting worse i mean i can tell that just by driving in Dallas you have the low flying flying gray cloud on certain days but right you know it really gets to you in terms of being able to breathe and and and things like that so we know that if you do the same thing to like your plants and you don't let them breathe they kind of die on you uh-huh um and so you know looking at the different areas that um cause air pollution um i guess we have industry for one um that has to be i guess a little bit more aware of you know the output and uh harmful chemicals and things that they use um what do you think about that well i think it's very true uh they're a lot of companies that don't have much regard for the environment they're primary goal is to produce a product as cheaply as they can and uh oh right you know some environmental standards like a filters on smokestacks et cetera are quite expensive and they just don't want to sink the money into it unless someone clamps down on them makes them do it and dumping chemicals et cetera and all that you know they're just looking for the easy way out which you know i guess they're very shortsighted and they only look at what interests them and so i guess yeah sort of you got you got to blame them but you understand what they're why they don't do it you just have to educate these people to what they're actually doing show them like this is what your plant is doing and we as consumers have to be prepared to pay a higher cost for the product which probably stops a lot of people from getting involved in the environmental issues you know they besides sinking their own time into it is that when we police these companies you know they say well look we're having to pay two million to put this filter device on it you're going to pay an extra thirty cents at the store for uh whatever and we're like oh no you know that's a so but and recycling i'm big on recycling and uh yeah oh good yeah but you know a lot of people aren't i mean people i know that are just you know they're good people and they know i go you don't recycle that uh no like well just stick it in a different bag you know like aluminum cans like if i if i give you a bag and you stick the cans in there will you give them to me oh yeah i'll do so you know i'll right i'm going to work on doing that a little bit more to people that you know they just aren't they're just not either not aware or they just don't think about it well that's true i think you know we we had such i mean i'm i'm close to forty and i can remember the good old days when we didn't have to worry about all this stuff and life was pretty you know um complacent in these areas and uh i think you're right though that we not only pay the price in money we're going to pay the price in our health and our future you know in the future of whatever's going to happen here uh-huh and you know it takes a few people you know on the alert to uh um really make a change and make a difference in the way people think and you're right about the education it's just got to be little by little by little until people become aware but i think we've got sort of a snowball effect going on now and i think that you know in terms of air pollution we're um pinpointing certain you know industries in our own communities that are you know blatantly um abusing the airspace uh-huh and i think we're beginning to make them aware that um you know it's not just the a financial bottom line that they have to look at it's you know um it has a a bigger impact on the on the whole environment and the whole area and gosh i i don't know you know health seems to get in in the act too you know your your health and your lungs and and all this i mean this comes down to smokers right and i don't know what to do about smokers because you know that's sort of an infringement of they're rights see you can go overboard too you can be real radical about this and i'm not for that i'm for persuading people by the use of education and by demonstration and by um you know your example of how things go um and you know i know there's some real radicals out there and and that that'll tend to turn you off anytime and think that they're you know full of baloney and they're not you know on the right planet sometimes yeah but you know what i mean about that yeah think it's education like you said that really needs to and it starts with you yeah like you said just tell them to you know they're what why you're doing why you're collecting cans and why you're collecting glass and why you're recycling the stuff and gosh it just seems though um i guess we could talk about smoking because it is a form of air pollution and uh oh my my father passed away at the age of fifty of a coronary artery disease and he had smoked oh you know pretty heavily since he went in the Army at like age eighteen and you know i've been fairly well educated on that subject and and i feel that uh you know that was a primary factor that caused his premature death yeah so i'm sort of on a band wagon to say about the smoking the adverse affects of smoking and i just wonder you know all the time when i was a little kid breathing the smoke secondhand smoke which people say is just as bad or even worse worse just as yeah than what the smoker gets through the filter you know what affect that had on me for a coronary artery disease when i was younger but you know i i don't think i'm what you would call a a radical but it just seems that people that smoke you just don't they just don't listen well get it's yeah it's hard it's really hard and they have to maybe sort of like like hit bottom like they either have to die or they have to be you know totally incapacitated before they change their mind and you know right bless their hearts you can't do anything that will impact them or or you you can't find a way really that it's it's it's almost like you know you can talk about alcoholism too i mean you know in this hidden in this manner sometimes i think that it's just a person has to change their mind yeah and uh it's tough but um you know it it i don't allow people to smoke in my house and i i hope they respect that and you know i i send them outside uh-huh yeah sort of thing and and they respect that or else they just don't come back they don't smoke in my car yeah and you know and it's not getting to be a big deal anymore i you know they they seem to uh understand or at least have a little bit of respect for your wishes and and they don't just necessarily light up and and uh you know not expect to get some flack these days yeah yeah so i guess the education has sunk in a little bit as to not you know as to respect another another person's clean air in that respect yeah but um i had an uncle that had quadruple bypass surgery and was near death many times and he's know you know they've told him for years to quit smoking and he still smokes you know well yeah you know some people are just but he's he's good and then he came to visit and he would run outside to smoke instead of smoking in the house so you know i have to say well i guess if you're going to do it do it out there and don't uh-huh use your own lungs don't borrow mine to take part in your air right that's cool yeah well things are getting i mean like i said i don't know why i know how old i am and i know that i never had to worry about the stuff i thought you k now the grass is green the sky was blue and the ocean was a pretty light blue you know and and i'm finding out that that's not always the case anymore and that you know the damage has been done um-hum and you know we're left with a mess in a lot of ways you know caused by um starting with the air pollution and and that's just one of the factors that goes into you know trying to get this place cleaned up but yeah if you notice uh i'm from Indiana and we really gauge the weather the winters by how much snow we get oh Gary Indiana huh which one oh really so uh it's when i was growing up you always could expect some snowfall twenty four even up to we had thirty eight inches of snow one time but the last few years we've barely gotten any snow at all really yeah it's you know maybe there'll be six inches on the ground at one time and it'll blow for a while and then it'll all melt away it's just like they kept talking about this you know the global warming the greenhouse effect and all that well i can just see it because yeah you know school would get canceled probably a week week and a half each year oh i remember yeah oh i'm from Chicago pardon grew i grew up in Chicago so yeah you know we had a lot of snow up there yeah you had a lot of snow and and you always had to scoop it and it was it was fun to play in but you know last few years oh absolutely  i i think that uh recycling is uh is real important right now or or you know for our future of the ecology and everything um-hum uh Richardson has uh started recently a newspaper recycling program um-hum where uh they pick up newspapers in their is they're part of the regular garbage pickup um-hum um-hum on uh Wednesdays every week and then we have recycling centers around you know for aluminum and glass and that kind of stuff um-hum um-hum so do you recycle up those products well i have not uh i haven't been doing much in the way of glass and that kind of stuff i have started recycling aluminum cans because of uh-huh you know i just keep those and then take them to one the sale there's a centers around that buy those yeah yeah and and yes i do stack the newspapers and put them out in the alley um-hum um-hum um-hum i did notice uh this Wednesday when i put them out i must have gotten them out late because they didn't pick them up so they probably picked them up with the regular garbage yesterday yeah probably yeah well they're uh out i'm out in uh California recycling has been in for a while i mean it's yes it's very important now i think it's actually always been important we're just recognizing it now that things are starting to run out um right it's um the main key to making recycling is to make it more convenient for people i think and the community i was just in not the one i just moved to uh had basically whenever you took your trash out you could just throw another bin of recyclable refuse out and not to be very you know you could have cans and aluminum cans and tin cans and bottles and everything and apparently they sorted it out which increased their labor costs tremendously right but uh that sure made it easy i mean there was like no excuse not to recycle you just need two trash cans and if it's recyclable you throw it in one and if it's not you throw it in the other and take both out um so that seemed to have been working quite well um seems like the other thing to make recycling more viable is to make it more economically uh you know increase the economic incentive uh like news recycled recycled newsprint isn't worth very much right now because there's a lot of it available and trees are still cheap uh-huh so from a purely economic standpoint i'd say recycling one way to increase to increase the viability of recycling is to increase the cost of the raw materials uh through selective taxation or whatever currently most things like aluminum only cost what it costs the company to produce them um without any charge for you know long-term effects on the land or you know with with minimal minimal taxation for replenishing replenishing replenishing the land after the mine is gone or health costs or all sorts of things like that or for that matter anytime you take aluminum out of the ground you can view it as you're stealing if from future generations yeah i guess that's a one way to look at it and and no one ever pays them you know basically you run out of these things and uh and then you have to start using something else yeah it seems like we're using up a lot of the abundant materials minerals right now i mean petroleum will be gone in about three decades at the rate we're going and it it just seems like increasing the raw cost of those would uh through you know more sensitivity of what the long term costs would be rather than just the extraction costs would i guess uh i my main concern with uh with the recycling is that we should be more geared to recycling or to eliminating the use of so much stuff that does not uh return to it's original uh is not biodegradable uh the plastics and the yeah um-hum styrofoams and things like that uh i really think we need to to really concentrate a lot more on on limiting those the use of those yeah uh i'm finding i'm i'm almost offended when i go into a restaurant now and they try to give me a styrofoam cup for coffee or something you know uh uh-huh but uh i think there's there's got to be a better way well things are changing i mean i've been really encouraged i've i mean i come from a family that's been recycling for thirty years and uh has always been you know concerned about these things and i'm just now starting to see you know significant social movement towards recycling yeah um the community the Berkeley City Council coined a term called precycling which i liked which is the idea of well you can recycle all these little aluminum cans and all this and that but you can also purchase products in the first place which uh use less resources um-hum you know not buy those styrofoam cups not buy individual aluminum cans if you're going to buy soda but get some you know larger reusable cheaper container and things like that right uh they call it precycling in other words keep recycling but minimize the original consumption too right yeah i guess that's a a good idea i do i would like to see uh we talk about buying the larger containers i'd like to see those larger containers not the uh not the plastic bottles i guess is the main thing well it's funny because plastic is incredibly recyclable um the problem is there's so many different types of plastic and they can't be mixed together right yeah but any one type of plastic can be recycled just about easier than anything because it melts down real easily and so forth can be yeah it's got to but it's got to go back to to the same product or is that is that the way it works um there are a number of laws about that some things can't be recycled back into the same products for health concerns even though they're not scientifically valid health concerns i mean because some you know anything will get killed when you melt down plastic uh yeah but and other things made to be uh can go back you know glass can go back into glass bottles and stuff um-hum but if it's mixed plastic it can only go to certain uses it can make actually plastic lumber for like uh park benches and things like that out of mixed plastic yeah yeah i saw a uh an advertisement on television yesterday for a garden hose it's a a soaker hose uh-huh it's made out of recycled tires um-hum um-hum and uh i thought that was a was an interesting idea i had not i had not heard of that before but i you know i knew that tires were recycled quite you know quite a bit for different things um-hum yeah although there's far a lot more could be done there are just there are yards just heaped with mountains literally mountains of tires which they don't know what to do with right yeah so if we can do more things with those that would be helpful yeah but uh i think you know i think that uh that the future should be that uh home builders and you know designers and everybody should be really gearing you know the the home to have a recycling center in it yeah yeah and more efficient pickups and everything and uh that's yeah we're uh my wife and i are are looking at you know designing a new house now and uh probably you know some years away before we'll be ready to build it but um-hum um-hum um-hum that uh that's one of the things that we're looking at is you know where we where are we going to put the recycling bins sure some kind of recycling chutes or something uh-huh right so uh we're going to have that designed you know where you know that in mind when we do our floor plans well that would be admirable i i think that's wonderful yeah yeah well great uh oh the last thing as long as i've got an audience is the uh i really want to see more recycling of batteries okay it's been oh yeah because batteries have all kinds of toxins in them and they're quite recyclable and most people just throw them in the trash or they leak into the ground water or all kinds of stuff right but most people aren't even aware that batteries are something you shouldn't throw away in the trash yeah i mean like Japan it's illegal to throw batteries away in the trash when you say batteries do you mean uh automobile batteries or well those are the worst defenders it's because they're biggest but even some of the small ones so need to be disposed of properly just your basic ten cell batteries um once they rust out there's some pretty nasty things in them especially the mercury ones hum but um it's it's it's a regular trash item in this country yeah um despite the fact that if you were if you were a company throwing that kind of stuff away the EPA could give you a major fine because it's a toxin yeah yeah so well that's uh that was some interesting ideas anyway and uh if i get a chance i'll uh pass those along okay uh-huh nice talking to you bye okay well nice talking with you bye-bye  now we have to talk about the savings and loans scandal oh my goodness yes do you have any strong opinions on that oh absolutely uh what are yours i i think uh it's all Congress' fault well i think there's a lot to be said for that point of view i i really think that congress turned on the taps and then there were lots of people there to carry away the water yep and i think the real problem wasn't the regulation which i supported but that they failed to similarly deregulate the insurance um i mean i think that was the real mistake they should have seen that coming it's that was like giving away free money oh sure we'll continue to insure insure you cheaply but you can you know do whatever you want with the way you loan the money well right and it should've been do whatever you want with the way you loan the money and by the way when you buy insurance you know they're going to be looking at how you do it he'll pay for it absolutely right and then the guys who want to spend it that way sure they'll pay more for insurance that uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that the people who were going to use the money that we were providing yep should've had there own at stake they should've have a lot more of their own capital on the line um-hum when they can leverage just a very small investment into millions of dollars worth of tax payers money and it's turning out to be a lot more than that right and they have absolutely no incentive to uh treat it prudently they just uh hand it over to anybody who walks in and asks for it absolutely absolutely because i mean their return is guaranteed um-hum they have nothing to lose and everything to gain you see you know can keep lending and keep growing yeah right then they can take the big salaries and have the all the perks and uh entertainment and so forth and then um-hum um-hum oh if people don't pay them back it's no skin off their nose they just sure in fact they've got a strong incentive to uh you know guarantee your money your deposits at six percent and go ahead and invest it in you know the junkiest bonds possible where the theoretical rate of return is high um-hum uh because if they win they win big and if they don't who cares they don't loose right yes they don't they don't lose anything well uh i don't know what could've been done other than the uh insurance regulation but i certainly think that was a mistake and the um i also think it was a mistake to reimburse all depositors over a hundred thousand dollars when they were told up-front that that was was was the limit yep yep i agree with you there too uh because uh the promise is this this the whole concept of too big to fail it's just silly yeah the promises don't mean anything now yep when the uh people put millions of dollars in some shaky operation right uh they figure the tax payers will bail them out because they have that's right and i also think the first thing they should've clarified was that the tax payer would give you a hundred thousand maximum i don't care how many accounts you've got hm absolutely uh i would've been in a little danger of uh you know i would've had to be very careful about where i put my money but i certainly would have right been alert and i would not have just been chasing the highest percentage return that's right and i mean it would've put these money brokers out of business on a CD yeah uh i don't think that'd be any great loss we could do without a few of those they don't seem to be providing very much useful uh service to people which i mean certainly contributed um-hum yep um-hum i mean if you invest in stocks or whatever you know it's it's not just the responsibility of the broker it's your responsibility you know to know what you're investing in and the kinds of risks you're taking and it seems to me if you're going to put more than a hundred thousand dollars or whatever the limit's going to be absolutely in a bank that you should be aware i mean it's one thing to have insurance when you're protecting the little guy who doesn't have the time to make or the expertise to make these sorts of decisions but it's another thing to be you know supposedly you would think hope that the big depositors like voters and everybody else are supposed to be educated about what they're getting into um-hum yes you would and uh uh i don't see why the for large sums of money why it should be any different from investing in a CD i i mean in a uh mutual fund or a money market fund or something like that right absolutely uh there are no guarantees on them that's right you uh you trust that the broker won't sell because certain brokerage houses will guarantee at least up to a certain point the investments in the funds that they manage but uh then you're uh just at the mercy of them because they could go under that's right yeah yeah i mean there is like for the brokerage houses there is a degree of insurance that the brokerage won't go bankrupt and you'll lose your money but there's certainly no guarantee that for example uh the commercial paper that the money market you invest in won't become worthless and your and your stock price will go down that's right yeah and that's fair enough um-hum well uh do you think that we're heading for another uh debacle of this sort in the uh insurance industry uh yes i mean there's got to be long long term consequences over this you know just because and we see reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their accounts that were these you know savings and loans and stuff right um so i mean this things just got to spread um-hum well i don't know how we're going to bail them out because if we're already how many trillion dollars in the hole where's the money going to come from um-hum yep and yet the we've got this enormous uh first executive insurance company just sailing out here in California and um maybe the people who uh bought term insurance aren't going to lose anything except a few months premium but all those um people who have money invested in uh uh annuities for their retirement are going to be up a creek and i don't know who's going to bail them out um-hum um yep it's a problem there already there already a few companies that had switched over from their own private plans to the first executive annuities that are not getting their benefit checks this time hm and the the state governor is saying that we're going to protect those people but how are we going to do that um-hu m where the state itself is already in hock uh we're running thirteen million dollars no billion sorry thirteen billion dollars in the hole for the next fiscal year and you know we've got to come up with that money because states can't run a deficit the way the federal government can and they're going to have to be laying people off out here in the state um-hum some of whom i don't think anybody will miss but when it gets down to teachers and cops it make a difference yeah um-hum well if only it would help you know pull the usual firemen for a scam right well the pay more taxes if the firemen go first yeah i think that's absolutely they keep all their fancy uh perks in the legislature and they uh still do their and they still have all their yeah yeah i think it's something like twenty five uh people on the payroll per a legislator hm yeah i i came from out here to California from Texas and i can very well remember people trying to change the Texas legislature to meet every year instead of every other year as the Texas constitution requires and people hm consistently voted it down and since they do enough damage every two years think of where we'd be if we let them meet yearly that's right yep and i really feel that way about the California ones too um-hum that i i think that if they could all just take about a five year vacation and let things settle down maybe we could figure out what exactly we need and start over um-hum but anyway yep i think constitutional congress would be probably a good idea uh-huh yep i i would vote for that um-hum well it's been interesting talking to you and i think we're in pretty much agreement on this yeah it's been good yep i think so too thanks for talking uh bye bye we'll see you bye  yeah i think um this is a tough subject because uh when you come from two different parts of the country uh the political views are really different i uh i i guess i've had to discuss a number of what might be considered controversial issues uh-huh i guess like i like and though nothing i guess nothing is as as awful as abortion but like gun control and uh day care and things like that and there are some very different views uh of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting you know well now you say you say two different parts of the country what are are you are you referring to yourself are you well yeah well being in in in Baltimore see Maryland is um is sort a um is probably liberalism is a is a hub of liberalism you know compared to the country uh you know very um uh-huh in in many ways uh very liberal very similar to New England though Pennsylvania and New York uh i aren't actually as liberal Maryland is a very liberal uh state so so where where here we have um we have gun control laws we probably have some of the strictest gun controls laws in the nation and most people in Maryland vote for that um-hum you know so it really is a different um uh well of course uh you talk gun controls down here in Texas and you're asking to be lynched yeah that's that's true i talked to a i had to talk about gun control with somebody and i talked with a woman who actually you know had had had just purchased a gun that day and was going target shooting you know and it was very different it was a whole different view it's really um hm um-hum this has opened my eyes to thinking you know at one time i just sat here and thought well how can anybody believe that because i'd really never met people that did and now i talk to people that do so that's it's really interesting well it's very true now i'm a a New Yorker by birth um-hum although i claim Florida as my home now uh i have two sons living down there but but i also have two sons living elsewhere one in Tennessee one in Mississippi but i lived in Tennessee in Florida for ten years and i kind of like it down there but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far um-hum yeah i think uh well in your words they were a little bit too liberal yeah isn't it funny i mean they permitted they i believe if i'm correct i believe they permitted to carrying concealed weapons um-hum but they uh quickly did away with it i think in the next session they they uh modified it hm yeah but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh Florida yeah well you can possess them here too but they have to be they're registered and uh like the the the Brady Bill that's currently being discussed nationally and whatever is very well supported here in gun control avenues and um the the the one week uh uh seven day delay you have the seven day waiting period uh-huh yeah that's uh that's well i don't mind that too much now i'm i'm with the NRA myself and uh uh really the only the objection we have yeah is uh you you give a little and next thing you know uh somebody's somebody's trying to take more yeah that's true that's very true that's and that's the way most i guess most of the um the political organizations work you know the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose and yeah and both of them are uh both want the extent of extremes so that they don't give anything for a balance you know there's there's always that difficulty well then tell me do you consider yourself a liberal um i would say i'm probably liberal yeah well let me ask you this then how is your what is your feeling yeah sure about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the American flag well i'll tell you i i think you know if they if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag it would never happen do you know what i mean um it's only because they make a big stink over it but i i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity their their their right in the sense of freedom of speech but i i would never well now wait a minute there there you just said it yeah it's their right by freedom freedom of speech what does speech have to do with burning a flag yeah well it's freedom that they i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to and i uh uh the the the whole aspect of being able to display your uh your ideas you know the what the country stands on America stands on is that they can do that uh though i would never even consider it in a million years to do it myself i i i think uh you know but i i still what the stands flag stands for i guess to me is that if somebody wants to voice their opinion or display their opinion openly and if that is a a way that they can show their opinion then they should be allowed uh now uh well i i still go back to unless the burning unless the actual fire hinders somebody's health and well-being you know but i i think that's i guess that's i think that's my opinion yeah i guess you feel differently then would you condone the burning of the capitol building uh no but i think that's that's the it's that's taxpayer's money if somebody buys their own flag and and burns it that's fine but that that's you know that's destruction and of of uh public property and whatever uh then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh what a public uh symbol no i don't know i guess the symbolism oh i think what America stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government uh yeah but here again i go back to the second amendment you can disagree by speech freedom of speech uh i think that's what's made democracy yeah um-hum yeah which has nothing to do with action well that's that's true yeah but i think i i guess now i am i am adamantly against that yeah i i guess i guess the idea you know they always keep saying like the framers um there uh of one of the Republican the appointees for the judicial the judicial bench and they always talk about that they they feel that this person believes in the framing of the constitution what the original framers the ideals the original framers set down and um um-hum i believe that the idea of burning the flag is is in my understanding of how it was framed is that you this country the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government and you can display that yeah um-hum uh i guess yeah i guess and and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and whatever i i think that that's viable um as long as it's your flag and and you've made your your point i think yeah yeah because realistically like for you for you you don't think it's right no and i would never do it i i love this country too much and that symbol means a lot to me um-hum um but i guess it's just one of those things where if they if that's what's something if a need for them you know well here again we uh even though you uh physically you agree with me you you wouldn't do it yourself yeah yes no but nevertheless you maintain that it's it is the right of of any citizen to burn the symbol of their country right yeah um-hum uh um so long as it's their possession okay you're you're that's fine up to there except that uh the what that flag symbolizes is uh uh is this country um-hum and i used to know as a Boy Scout but all i remember was the red in the flag represented blood that that was shed to to create this country and to maintain it yeah and to me that's uh uh a a black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country i agree there too i agree with you there too i i the um i i it's i find it you know personally disgusting but i don't think that i don't think that uh hm um-hum we have a right to stop somebody from that you know the same i don't know i guess i get i get all all mixed up inside when it's very easy to do yeah it gets when it's uh it's an emotional issue and you sit and you try and think about it logically and and and you know you try to say to yourself now emotionally this is a disgusting thing uh but logically um even you know for instance the pro-life pro-choice movement uh you know i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion but they would vote pro-choice um-hum because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know somebody an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing well i think it should be permitted under certain circumstances circumstances you know but yeah but it that's uh that's what i mean see most but but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing and it evokes an emotional response i think that's the hardest thing i don't know if i could ever be a judge because some things emotionally just aren't you know um-hum well tell me has it ever been decided when when is a uh fetus a human no no i think the um sometimes i guess what did i read recently the um the the uh Christian uh point is is always the point of well it's at conception but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology hm so then that so that throws out that idea it makes it a religious discussion then so it's i don't know it's very it's it's uh you know it's a it's a topsy turvy world and it's really something how um political ideas and viewpoints within one country can vary so much and also within um or they on their own within the own uh society it can vary within a yeah and how yeah how it'll sway from one extreme one extreme to another um-hum uh i think that uh you know i i just read something i think in Time magazine uh about about um protest on  uh are you a TIer no okay well we might have a difference uh to talk about on clothing uh you sound like some guy i talked to yesterday what you sound like the same person i talked to yesterday i am how come we got the same conversation subject i don't know okay i was amazed that they had the same subject on clothing too i never have had that before i noticed it on the weekends occasionally when i call well so was i and how could they possibly get the same person that's ridiculous okay well have your opinions changed in the last twenty four hours no no they sure haven't what other aspects i'm i i'm this is funny you know uh clothing let's see uh i was curious you know if they just want to talk about the words of uh related to clothing that polyester was coming back have you heard that uh i saw it on the TV that the models were no ooh gross they had a new kind of polyester uh whether that they just like to switch materials uh periodically i don't know we might i haven't we didn't talk about materials i i prefer you know the cotton with very little in fact when i look for oh definitely uh i i try to go for the cottons and i don't know that polyester will although men's shirts are half-and-half or sixty forty or whatever i mean polyester especially in this climate polyester just doesn't work too well yeah i uh i'm originally from the east and i we used to wear sweaters and things and sweaters are uh-huh this isn't necessarily sweater country uh you know i i guess they're not as popular as they were i don't know about how women if you do you have problems with air-conditioning or were you you were uh uh is that a factor yeah it's always yeah it seems like it's always cold inside and part of my problem is that i'm in and out a lot because that's very bad yeah yeah we've got a lot of buildings downtown and i have to go to a lot of meetings in different buildings and so i'm in and out of the air-conditioning and you know like i said we have to wear suits and that's yeah you know it it gets to be quite uncomfortable at times at TI i am too in and out and well of course we don't wear ties and jackets certainly not in this kind of weather the the jackets they don't disappear but they you know they're they're on a hook usually the vice president's or the manager's and again i used to wear them but i don't i don't bother with it right now yeah that is a problem uh where did i see an article about where they're about that subject where they're trying to have oh i know it was lunchrooms where they're trying to encourage people to stay at work and so that's why they even downtown this might be applicable huh where they're trying to have restaurants within walking distance but at the same time in other words you go down in a subway or whatever uh-huh and go to lunch and they say that's so much more healthy for you than going out in the street in the open traffic and going to lunch you'd be better of is that right i'm sure maybe you do have some tunnels down there oh definitely yeah i mean and they they say that's so much more healthy for you to you know when you have to go out or go to lunch or whatever it's to to walk or however and get to a place that is uh you don't have to go in and out of the of the temperature i haven't heard that whether that affects how you dress i can imagine uh the last thing i heard about fashion i think i mentioned it yesterday was that wide ties were coming back right yeah i uh i don't know i think i always run a little bit behind It takes me awhile to get used to well i i'm for colorful things and i sure i i do enjoy the uh the newer products along those lines what do you think about women and wearing slacks and all that we haven't talked about that oh i wouldn't wear slacks to work okay um people don't where i work i mean it's just not done yeah at all but now i have worked places where they do and even then i still didn't do you have children i might comment on teenagers how they dress i don't have a teenager i have a six year old and he's still oh you have a lot to experience i have two he's still at the age where i can dress him how i want to right well have the opposite then i have uh well one of they're almost now teenagers at one twenty almost twenty and one almost sixteen and i learned early on being surrounded by women here that the i i love to take them shopping but i don't pick anything out you know i i just kind of influence but uh the the teen the junior high teenagers really yeah i don't know if you can describe how they dress you know you you well i have a girlfriend who has a daughter that's a teenager and every year before school starts she has me take her shopping for clothes because they fight too much i i know what angle that we can talk about here we they want us to talk about clothes around work but uh the way kids in school should dress and i'll give you my opinion i don't think that the school should just kind of let the kids dress what is the current style not that it's totally ridiculous of course but well i just read something in fact i think it was today about how the public a lot of private or a lot of the public schools now are going to uniforms public schools oh i didn't hear that yet yeah because uh they feel like there's too much competition in the clothing and it it clearly defines you know class lines in where you know the the Guess jeans and the you know stuff as opposed to the people who can't and so it takes people's concentration the thought behind it is that people won't concentrate or worry about what they're wearing what everybody else is wearing and it will take their mind off that and you know enable them to you know study better plus they say right well well whoever said that in my opinion doesn't have any teenagers who didn't grow they won't do that they'll never pass it that will be like this was they weren't talking about it wasn't talking about actually i i kind of like that idea and i had my son in private school where they do wear uniforms and uh i i really like that right uh-huh i can uh of course i went to school you know a hundred years ago in college and uh we did wear ties and jackets and this was they have since changed it was an engineering school a city it was in an downtown area like i don't know well you can't compare anything around here to the school in like no UTA here is in Arlington it's not exactly downtown but i guess like that and they just historically since it was in the city they wanted us to wear jackets and ties and i did my whole college career which is i guess terribly unusual huh we wore jackets and ties for four years and i so subsequently i wanted to get a masters degree in in after i got out of the service and uh they changed drafts so there was a that is yeah the styles have certainly changed to where i guess my campus now looks like typical uh college campus i guess yeah i think well i think for a while kids were dressing nicer in colleges but um nowadays uh i i still i take classes at UTD and they um you know they wear jeans and sometimes they don't even have shoes on huh the older i get the more more open to other people's ideas uh you cannot be you have to let them come out with uh whatever they not whatever but some of their ideas too and so you kind of back off and see what people and i know their clothing is changing you know all the time and i'm i'm certainly open uh-huh to how you should dress uh now of course the subject is work uh or clothes really i guess yeah uh and the only again the one thing i am at at work is is certainly a professional look but i'm not saying that that will not change the professional look will look differently from year to year perhaps do you spend a lot of money on clothes for work no i really don't it's uh uh go through a lot of shirts and think no i don't really you know i think and and this may be totally unfair and unfounded but it seems to me like women have to spend more money on clothes for work then men do because men can have a few suits and you know a bunch of different shirts and some different ties but you know women practically have to have you know a whole bunch of different suits uh-huh right well you're sure right there because not even when i wore a jacket and a lot of the guys when i was up at Spring Creek in uh Plano uh we think he just brought the same jacket even that wasn't a that's not a black mark against the man and you're right that uh women are expected to look more everything matches i guess yeah and then of course you know accessories you know shoes and hose and earrings and you know all that stuff right right right um it's just i it's outrageous you know because you know you still spend two three hundred dollars on a suit your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or no i ultimate leave and i haven't been at work in awhile so i i don't really know are the ties oh you know from what i i went to a concert earlier this week and saw some people and just noticed how there's a lot of the wider ties uh-huh but they're not they're not the same as the wide right uh-huh uh TI has several locations different sites have a little bit different dress dress like i said at Spring Creek it was definitely more formal i think because it was newer and uh type and many many more people wore there was very there was very few production areas do you think it has anything to do with the ages of people uh that  ready to talk okay i guess so okay uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that it's worked and the times that it hasn't worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit okay yeah okay tell me how yours work well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh we're on the east coast now um-hum my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina uh-huh and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget yeah and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh um-hum so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do that's satisfactory and we've been here seven months and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast so you see well we actually planned for about one year oh good uh thank God because it never occurred really that was smart it never occurred to us that it would take seven months yeah and uh what we did was just uh decide what how we had been spending our money before um-hum and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didn't want to come down oh uh-huh yeah and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would wow that's great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of but oh just our own design uh-huh uh-huh gosh and uh so but we've had budgets that didn't work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked yeah we spent too much money until our kids children went to college so yeah yeah so tell me about do you all uh have a budget well we've been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more fun kinds of things that uh didn't really um you know have a real strict budget but budget but uh the the about into our when when when when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well wonderful and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved yes and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i don't know if we we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least we've got a place to live um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um three and a two year old bang bang uh-huh that's that that threw our budget really out of out of whack too and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh uh i don't know we've we've tried different times we've done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went um-hum and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like there's um times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know well i think that's important for your budget to be realistically for it to work though you have to do something yeah that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then it's not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they don't know the difference at this age you know whether they're Jordache new or whether they're of course not you know something and they're both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each other's clothes so but um that's the hardest part for us is that it's really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned um-hum but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before yeah yeah um-hum and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends on your friends that's true that's true well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and yes you know a lot of things like that that really is are hard to plan for and uh well i really do i think you have to budget those things though yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year you're going to have on extra expenses for car and yes exactly or know so much per month anyway yeah yeah and uh that really should be in your bank but if you don't spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month yeah our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isn't isn't let's see now i forget which way we do it we don't list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year oh no no no no you don't want the government to spend your money you want to be able so that's not a good way of doing it that's what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didn't get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years for many years yeah yeah yeah uh and if and if that's the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it that's what you should do yeah because we don't miss it we really don't when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so um-hum um-hum but we're trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision envision the uh expenses for college already you know eighteen years away or whatever well i was just reading an article in uh a North Carolina paper paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities gosh she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done i guess that's fantastic where there's a will where there's a will there's a way right yeah well i have enjoyed talking to you well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and don't spend any money this weekend oh i know uh we'll have to stay home and mow the yard oh boy bye bye-bye  do you own a PC yeah i do i own a um i own an i an X T clone it's a Samsung and uh with a Hyundai monitor monochrome monitor that i just keep at home for work yeah and acts as a terminal for me because i'm a graduate student and i log out of school from there oh good what are you taking in school i'm a graduate student in psychology yeah i do uh language acquisition work hum but it's it's it's very helpful it's nice to have a machine at home that i can use locally for things like writing and so forth but i don't oh it it's uh ideal for that yeah and then i don't need printer or anything word processing part is is extremely useful i think yeah i don't need a printer or anything because i just sort of i can just call school and transfer everything over to school over the phone lines so how about you do you have um a machine uh-huh an an P S E and okay i know it i've been used to working and this my first years but all of the work that i do is plus getting to know it a little bit better they're powerful little rascals yeah P S two's are general architecture uh they're a little bit different though um we have two model seventies that we just bought last year and they um yeah there are some slight differences between those and other machines i'm finding oh i fell it's fine i actually don't i haven't actually noticed a major difference between a P S two and everything else actually uh-huh um you know in in in terms of performing faster or better or anything i'm not actually sure what the major advantage of a P S two over anything else is with the possible exception of the fact that it's got a mouse port built in the back yeah i'd i've noticed uh there was some scattered at work and i notice the uh through put is much faster on mine than than those but i think it's just because of the the lower level in expectation out of them that the processing speed is much faster on uh the same canned programs yeah yeah i think so um it's it's although although it's funny because i just i just had a discussion on break on one of our machines because it's just too slow uh-huh we have a decent somehow it slipped by us that we had bought one with two meg and of of memory of of RAM and one with only one yeah and we're running this new version of Lotus i don't know if you've ever seen this or not you know or performed to uh eighty percent expectation anyway yeah that's true actually i um i found that this particular version three of Lotus one two three actually i think performs maybe even in the high ninety per cent of what i'm expecting at this point i am yeah it's it's it's because i'm new enough at it yet that i haven't figured everything out what was your first exposure to the computer my first exposure was i guess when i was an undergraduate um a couple of years ago we had they they inundated us with Macintoshes uh-huh they brought a bunch of Macs into uh there must have been some sort of program and they brought Macintoshes in for us to for the school to do you know for all the kids in the school to do word processing on and right is there an undergraduate requirement on them no there there never was an undergraduate requirement it just everyone really everyone took to them very quickly because there were a number of them available and what about all the majors are there any such as business or uh or other undergraduate majors do they require it of any of them uh i'm not sure they must have they didn't in my case i was a psych major and they didn't i know that here they're required of some of of um where i am now yeah they require it of of actually a number of different uh majors you know um some psychologists people psychology can take that in lieu of other courses and people in business have to uh i think are supposed and people in cognitive science definitely have to well actually it's expanded your field too because the psychology of of man working with machine is is a whole new element that oh yeah i i actually um you said you said you work on mainframes a lot that's a lot of what i do is on a a Sun i don't know if you work on Suns at all um uh-huh so Sun Microsystem machine which is another mainframe in a type of a mainframe we do lots of um sort of brain you know neural network modeling uh-huh uh-huh on on on a on a lot of mainframe machines so yeah this is been a lot of expanding and having to be able to have things at home and and to study the interaction too has been wonderful yeah it's interesting i think uh i've i've worked with computers since nineteen sixty sixty wow yeah i'm an old man well no i mean wow they must have been very different back then no they were the IBM six fifty took up a whole room as a vacuum tube uh machine and it was binary quinary um base five uh uh wow why base five i have no idea i didn't never did learn why but it was a base five which is very interesting God so you've really watched the whole the whole field grow up oh it's been amazing it really has been i mean the the the notion of personal computer back then meant you had to have your own living room oh i know it i know it and it's almost like talking about the checkless society and and all of that and you know there was talk in fact my brother uh was with IBM from nineteen fifty four until about three years ago so we really had a family history of talking about development of uh of equipment wow so this is the perfect topic for you oh you know and i do i do some programming of my own too using Cobol rather than any of the newer languages it's just one that i've known for a long time and still use it even on this okay PS two so i have to learn a tolerance with canned programs because i'm so used to being able to do exactly what i want to do rather than having to work around or go through two or three different steps to get to the the final one but i am amazed at the power and uh ability of these small units that sit on a table or desk well how do they compare with like um you know the the big um the big you know the ones that that took up a whole room in the sixties i mean how would you you know power wise was that less well actually less powerful oh it it was almost well it's hard to describe but it's almost like uh an abacus versus an electronic electronic calculator you know you oh God really you go that that much and and and that much bigger too for the same analogy wow oh yeah but i mean the speed using punch cards and for your information Ken this first uh first computer had one had two accumulators okay and one focal point that you had to channel everything into it was called a distributor and you moved it from memory you had to know exactly where in memory it was there was no relative memory oh God okay and you had to know exactly in memory where it was move it to the distributor put it into one of the accumulators and add it take it back out of the distributor and put it somewhere else so it it was as basic as you can get and uh of course the speed of processing was very very slow but compared to anything then it was very very fast right so it everything is relative that's true twenty twenty years from now we'll we'll call up again and say what do you think of the new uh thought computers that's true right and they'll and they'll say imagine those big clunkers right of big laptop computers way back one yeah but i think they're they're excellent tools for people to learn how to use and i'd like to see them in grade schools right now i think they are in fact does it yeah there's there's the computer system uh instruction going to say there's a big move for that yeah my uh my my sister-in-law is a principal of a school uh-huh and she just switched but before she was in a um a in a in a different school and she wrote a grant with i think it was Apple or IBM one of the two uh-huh i'm pretty sure it was Apple actually to uh to get a whole bunchy of you know PCs into or PC type machines into the school for the kids to use and and it just according to her it's just a wonderful thing kids go in and are able to work at their own pace and you know computers aren't impatient yeah they'll sit there and wait forever if the kid doesn't want to answer for awhile or it'll um it'll you know the kids for those kids who really have a problem working with faster than the class or slower than the class it lets them go what she's finding now is that in evenings the parents will come in and do it too oh yeah yeah but it has a lot of home uses too i've i've not i don't have mine hooked up to anything uh you know it's just a stand alone but the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone  i pay a good deal of taxes i guess because i i make a fair amount of money and uh the taxes that i pay um i guess as a as a general statement i feel i i guess i get my money's worth for okay i'm not sure though whether i feel i guess i am sure that i feel that in general though uh the allocation uh of the taxes in certain areas isn't isn't correct well i'm sure that uh probably every person in this country would agree with you on that because everybody has a different idea of where the money should go well i i lately i guess um uh or at least for the last twenty twenty years or so i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost uh defense items at least in the last ten years have been uh there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there and i'm not really sure that that we've gotten our money's worth there uh regardless of the outcome of the Desert Storm uh Desert Shield uh situations uh-huh yeah uh i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the military military off and on over the over the years of being called back and things of that nature is uh i've found that you know there's an extraordinary amount of waste i take that as a as a given in any military operation and oh yeah no argument here yeah and i guess i i should imagine that that that what the what the problem why i i'm i'm a little concerned about today is that this uh rather uh quick and and easy i don't know i shouldn't say easy rather quick victory in the in in the uh Mideast uh uh over the uh Iraqis uh might lead us into uh a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe i'm i i don't know what other foe that would be but uh i i'm just getting nervous again now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area yeah well of course uh a lot of uh a lot of missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war and the and the inventory's going to have to be restocked uh on now i work for TI and one of the things we were told is like they had eleven thousand Harm missiles which TI is the sole supplier for and they used up two thousand of them in in the war so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that to get ready in case something else is needed yeah but it it it it would that be uh well let's see two thousand out of eleven thousand that's about a little over twenty per cent uh i i should imagine that that would be to keep it at a level those levels i guess that that were originally appropriated was was when the Soviet threat i guess was perceived as being a greater one i don't think there's very much of a threat there today i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left in the territories uh in their territory over there and who's controlling them but that that's true that's true i i don't know what amount of what amount of our hardware would stop some fanatic i guess from doing anything uh that would be irrational well of of course now we used up twenty per cents per cent of that inventory in a matter of just a few weeks right yeah and uh uh uh TI also makes the missile which was the the TV laser guided bombs yeah and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that that was that was just a matter of what what is the name of that uh it's called Paveway yes yes and uh a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also so those those are two areas in which TI stands to to gain some some short term business to restock that yeah well i i i'm what i'm uh i guess uh it concerned about talking about the taxes in general and that that was an area that i i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for uh in the area of defense or perhaps we have paid too much there i don't know it just seems to me that over the years now the and and it's it's a cliche i i but i see it myself i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down the roads the highways oh no doubt i i i don't know uh i know i'm familiar with some some upbeat school areas so i don't totally agree with the the great uh uh with the with the great expenditure expenditure of effort and time there but i guess overall because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools and and uh and uh rural school systems are like i i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure yeah as a matter of fact in Texas um we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by the a state judge and they and uh the legislature just passed what they called a Robin Hood Bill which basically what it does is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts that are that are you know come from local taxes um-hum and send them to other parts of the state that are not so affluent that they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system or is it all funded out of local taxes uh well okay to give to give you some perspective this this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eighty three was funded sixty five per cent by state funds yeah then we had a number of education reforms that the legislature said hey we got to do this we got to do this we got to do this but they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it and they dumped it all on the local school districts sounds like the way the federal and state system works now yeah so really so so what ended up happening was was a was a shift we went to sixty five per cent state funding to sixty five per cent local funding in a matter of four years and uh i mean uh do you mean a a complete reversal oh complete complete it's all shifted to local districts and now even the money that's been raised for the local districts is being is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state because i guess they can't raise that money in those those poorer districts huh that's right and and i have i have no problem with uh a certain uh floor level minimum level that's a standard uh that everybody uh ought to be able to have uh but i am opposed to yeah any attempts to restrict um local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum yes i see what you're saying uh i uh i i do i i guess i am a strong uh a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education i mean by that i mean i'm a product myself i have uh a a a a background of uh being uh getting my college education through the GI Bill so did i my Master's anyway what but uh when i look at it to me uh it doesn't really make any difference it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done i don't think i would have gone on unless i had that financial yeah uh easement made possible that's right and i i don't really care what it takes to qualify whether you're uh an an whether you're a veteran or whether you i don't even know if you have to perform community service or unless uh or or you promise to even do something in the future i think that uh the that that the subsidy itself or i gu ess the enactment of that form of legislation uh-huh would give many people who i i think i i think i perceive the fact at least what i read is that some younger people feel that education is priced out of their uh out of their uh budget i know in the state of Florida just today uh the the legislature uh adjourned and uh they had completed a fifteen per cent increase in the in the uh state land grant colleges which which isn't i mean to me it doesn't sound like a mot of money but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year they went from eleven to fifteen hundred uh-huh yeah and uh for an out of state student the tuition went up twenty five per cent i don't know what that would be yeah they had to they had to raise uh community college taxes here a few years ago too but that uh i guess that goes along with the general idea that the federal government had to uh was expending so much money on defense uh that that the program now is a uh program now is uh fees that that fund these things i guess that's trickled down to the states and the states now establish uh don't have enough money so they uh-huh they must charge fees uh i i i'm not too sure of that reasoning yeah but i guess to get back to the main topic i don't know whether i pay too much taxes i i i travel extensively in Europe and see enormous uh people pay pay uh a great deal in taxes they tell me when i sit and talk to people there they tell me they they some states they pay uh in Germany or in in England in some cases people in my income level at least allege that they pay up to six fifty five percent of their gross income in taxes oh oh i can believe that but but i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in my car tax my income tax and these myriad of uh now it costs me money to leave the country some sort of a tax to leave the country some sort of an airport departure tax yep yeah uh uh a tax a sales tax which is getting to uh quite high levels i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that well i guarantee you you'd be paying a lot more in taxes if if uh the Democrats had more say you really think so yeah i really do but i mean what what's what's happened here is is is i feel that that in the last ten years uh my taxes have gone up they haven't gone down i pay uh quite a bit more taxes and and and yeah every everybody is but that's been a Republican government for the last ten years well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase well i to keep it to keep it becoming from becoming even more obnoxious yeah well this has been really interesting and i've enjoyed our talk okay uh i guess i just push something here push one again right no you just uh we just say say good-bye and that's it just hang up okay Don good talking with you nice talking with you too bye-bye bye-bye  okay uh we're going to talk about our lawn and garden garden chores do you have either one well i don't do anything with the lawn really but i do gardening both flowers and vegetable gardening do you oh really um i we have enough property that we uh can have a little bit of a garden and that's fun well actually we've always had one even when we haven't had big yard because um we enjoy that we love fresh vegetables in the summer and it's just one of the things i enjoy doing so do i i would i had rather be outside than inside any day so would i do you work during the week uh outside the home yes i do uh so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward i work for a school system so i'm able to do that um because i get at home a little earlier uh-huh yes and i can still do some some sorts of things but or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight oh absolutely well i unfortunately am not gardening this year i love gardening in fact i was presented at like twenty no about thirty years ago with a life membership uh from the Richmond Virginia counsel of uh garden clubs wow and it wasn't because i was so good but i organized a very large garden club but i still have uh oh that's wonderful it well it's always something that seems so odd to me but uh but that's that's i mean you really feel you can accomplish something and to help other people too that's neat yes it had really nothing to do with uh actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that it was just that i happened to organize this group that was about seventy people uh-huh right that's wonderful yeah that isn't yeah that that those numbers were were great but it yeah well i think it sounds good i've never belonged to a garden club because i've always been more interested in just doing what i can do my on my own i've never had the time really to get involved in the organized yes sort of format but i know people who do it and and enjoy it very much well and actually i think that most women's garden clubs that i've been aware of in the past uh are only flowers what i would like we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma just moved to to North Carolina oh and uh we were originally originally of course from this area from Virginia but uh in North uh in Oklahoma it's the men's garden clubs that i would have wanted to join my word and you would have because they do all kinds of uh gardening and not just flowers like women do um-hum um-hum for heaven's sake well um there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that i know of they're they're women but um and usually they're the tea type things you know where they have a little luncheon and they do their thing but um flowers are primarily the emphasis um-hum yes i think so too um whereas i enjoy vegetable gardening almost more i do flowers sort of look pretty but i i really like to do the vegetables yes and and i have spent the last ten ten years being a florist being what being a florist oh my well what a wonderful thing it was nice it was exhilarating uh for many years uh many of those ten yes until the last couple when uh we had such an economic slowdown oh terrible yeah yeah well tell me what's in your garden this year since i don't have one okay well uh the flowers i'm just in fact i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in i i always have geraniums and um-hum um and then i have a shady area that i need to uh be concerned about not getting something that has to have sun so i've discovered that uh impatiens that tried and true is turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus um um-hum because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh but i like the vinca which is something i hadn't they look sort of like impatiens you know but they're not quite and they're better for the sun areas um and of course you know the mine are old very ordinary flowers marigolds and and that sort of thing yes do you have trouble with uh red spider on marigolds in my no i don't i don't know maybe this climate is a little better maybe it's yes um-hum um-hum um but in the vegetable garden we grow um usually well our favorite is something called white half runner green beans now that's well do you isn't that funny so is my favorite well you know why because i grew up in North Carolina and that was my mother's um favorite bean she always she always grows you know five different varieties but that's the kind that produces the best okay yeah yeah well i think it has the best flavor and and they're wonderful and i pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit my mother picks them when they're fat and she cooks them for an hour with some fat back yes uh-huh well i like them in between i like them in between and they're good both ways yeah yeah the flavor is better i think in between oh in between the size wise yeah yeah yes yeah um-hum my mother well my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way i cook them well and i no i love them well that's the yankee way but i think that's like another vegetable i love them that way just the thrill of oh of course yeah it is they're two different vegetables that way um-hum um-hum um-hum in fact i my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year oh my gosh my does mother mother will be thirty ninety this year and she lives in western North Carolina and uh she would do that if uh if we didn't tell her that she'd better not yes um-hum yes but she doesn't have that big a garden but she has a bigger one than i do and i have four children you know so really yes and she tends to it herself uh-huh isn't that wonderful oh yes oh yes oh it is it's great it's it's really her joy and i guess suppose that's why i enjoy gardening because you know growing up with it we also grow um yellow and green squash um much to my children's chagrin i think so too yeah uh-huh right and uh we grow a lot of tomatoes uh there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes uh-huh no so we enjoy that um we grow i i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family but i actually was successful for the last two years so wonderful bet you showed them i'm going to do it again that's right and we grow broccoli oh and i have been very uh happy about the new way of controlling the the uh worm that gets in broccoli um Bacillus by using the Bacillus thuringiansis which is the uh little well in fact that's what they use for gypsy moth i don't know if you have had that problem there or not no but it's you know it's a problem that's that's moving south from from the New England area and they devastate the trees so they they spray the the government uh sprays um yes two two three times in the spring when the uh caterpillars are are coming along because what they do this this uh Bacillus um the worms ingest it and it expands in their in their um digestive tract and they die um-hum so that's the same technique that is you know for any of the other uh little varmints that get in vegetables so it that's really very nice because it's a non-toxic way of of handling the problem great well we could chat we could really talk gardening a long time i'm enjoying hearing you so much so well it's nice hearing you talk and i'm i wish you uh good luck have you just recently moved to Charlotte um yes uh no October uh so yes recently seven months and it the weather is wonderful i love it it's just terrific you know rains a little too often oh so well that's not very long yes oh that's great that's great well i hope you have a an opportunity to garden again oh i think so i have a little spinach oh well good bye-bye bye-bye  okay my daughter this week uh as part of a uh in her high school Humanities Humanities course she has been taking a little sub course that was offered where they actually write off you know and request their um preferred college they had to write to a minimum of three preferably five that's probably a good idea and i think she did four and they actually had typed little letters requesting you know catalogs and what not and figure up mileage expenses and all kinds of little trips home and they had to figure one airline uh trip home and at least one car trip home per year and gosh you know like i said it's good that that if you visit at least four or five colleges before they even you know go to attend go down there and visit for the weekend they do have those programs where you can go down there uh-huh have your kids gone to state schools uh well no uh actually uh my my daughter is quite young yet but uh i went to a state school uh and i find that overall they're probably much cheaper uh-huh uh-huh yeah and the quality of education's probably i would say is not much different than what'd you get at you know most of your like A&M Texas and uh you know Vanderbilt some of those uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh i think there are some difference but probably in size in in in capacity of classes and that sort of thing but all in all the education level is just as good if you if you participate yeah yeah my folks kind of had a an unwritten rule there were nine of us and we all just worked real hard to get through college we did but if we went to state schools we got virtually no help if we went out of state we got a lot more help from them um and kind of the premise being that um if you you know part of college is being far enough way that you can't come home and do you laundry and come home for all football games and yeah that kind of thing so i think that that's was some of the focus although i think they relaxed that i was one of the older ones because it got expensive they you know its some yeah well i tell you what it it's expensive of course i worked my way through and uh i think that is a good idea in some cases except that now a days it's just so expensive its just so expensive and you know this little exercise we did this week with out daughter we just cringed it just oh you know the chances of her being able to go her father's and i alma mater are pretty slim i'm afraid you know it uh well yeah it it it it can be cost prohibitive real quick you know i i wanna be able to at least i wanna pay my pay the tuition and you know give her transportation if it's necessary and course i'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible uh-huh i just really believe in dorms for at least the first year depending on the child but you know i but i don't want her to have to work i i would i would i don't mind if she has a little part time job to earn a little extra spending money that sort of thing and of course summer work and and summer work and things like that unless she just tends to go all the way through but uh i don't want to to have her to feel financially you know burdened uh and not you know concentrate on studying and that sort of thing yeah but uh i know like i guess probably one of the things that that i've i've learned is that to try and pick a college where they have at least three different degree plans that you would like as an alternative you start one you don't particularly like that one uh-huh uh-huh and that's okay you have something to go through because if you have to change colleges then you lose hours and then you have to go through all that uh preliminary uh applications yeah you know a lot of times you know people will go to a college when they get there they find out gosh i really don't like this at all oh and some a lot of things just don't switch they just don't switch and there's nothing there that they want other than that so they are faced with having to do all that and that can that can throw as much as a year out of your degree plan yeah that's really a very viable suggestion i haven't ever really thought of it like that although as you outlined it certainly makes perfect sense it just but uh that was one of the things that that i that i encountered uh so i i know yeah so and then also the other thing is going to a junior to the junior college you know from from experience well it's uh-huh uh-huh for at least two years to get all you preliminary courses your Math your English History Government all the things that that are time consuming uh and some of the course that you can take on television uh-huh uh-huh and get those out of the way before you even start a four year college because a lot of those course especially English and History so much less expensive and well less expensive but not only that but a lot of those course they there're extremely difficult if you're starting out in a four year degree plan at a four year college they're extremely difficult and they go a little faster and and in junior college they go a little slower and you do learn you know a little bit more self paced and uh uh-huh uh-huh well the uh Collen County Community College that we have out here is just growing by leaps and bounds we have been so impressed with it and uh you know my husband and i both have taken advantage of some the continuing education uh programs through it and as a family we've you know been involved with some of the arts things and you know that it's provided i've been really impressed but there was just that little piece of me you know going back to my own experience of oh gosh you know if my kids go there i'll never get rid of them i mean they'll never going to be on their own how long am i gonna you know have kids in my house yeah staying up till you know two or three in the morning well i think it's i think it's important that they do get away you know not necessarily so far that you can't get to them but at least that's right that's right you know a hundred miles or or even two hundred miles where you can at least go down there on a on a like a month a one month basis or they can come home yeah yeah that's you know and it's not real expensive uh you know uh lot of times they can share rides coming back and forth if they you know have people in the local area that live near them but uh well and you know i think if they know that they can't get home all the time then they they're more brave they know they are going to have to forge some new relationships and you know be yeah able to make new friends and they don't just hold on to the old hobbies and old the old activities they're a little more adventurous you know and you know none of did that we all stayed right close to home and of course i was married the whole time i was in school but uh but it was uh it was still one of those situations where mom and dad were still around if you needed them and uh thoughtful uh-huh so that yeah yeah you know not that i could really depend on them much but they were still there and you're not far enough you it's nice to know well we always were we had a lot of family in the area extended family my husband and i both uh uh went to a church school and we didn't have our families there but we had extended families uh-huh and um um i know i guess probably one of the other things that i notice is that some of the colleges are very much uh encouraging you know the kids to participate in all the fraternities sororities and all the extra curricular activities much so because they they are money making things and they do support they do help support the school uh-huh yeah yeah but i prefer colleges that don't stress that as the major focus yeah me too uh i i'd rather them go to the schools that focus on the academic part of it and that's a that's a that's a key now a days because a lot of the college promote the partying and the and the sororities and things like that and and once you get hooked you know you can really get uh locked up in that stuff and your grades suffer and your grades really suffer they really do uh i got wrapped up in that of course i was in you know athletics and stuff like that but it got so time consuming it got to be to where um uh-huh i had to decide either i was gonna just quit all that mess and go study or or or you know just basically skin through and at that point did you almost say gee i'm gonna have to get out of this school to do that uh well i quit i quit football i quit football because i just uh figured that it's not worth it what am i going to do with this after i get out i'm not gonna go pro football uh i'm not good enough i faced the you know faced that up front and say you know i'd rather get my grades and that's what i did i quit and went after after the grades have you been sorry no not at all so it we need to have you in our high school our Texas school system so really uh but but you know you a lot of kids get hurt and then they when they can't play pro ball anyway and then they don't have the education they should have what are they gonna do yep my uh and that's that's a that's a big thing right now that you that you're seeing is the athletics the a lot of them are playing before they even can finish college yep they're playing pro ball i think it ought to be be a prerequisite that they ought to have a degree with a certain amount of grade point average before they are even eligible for pro ball yep i agree because but they don't they wont do that i was just reading a thing in the uh this is off subject some what but in the Reader's Digest about uh athletes pro athletes and that uh that gotten on to drugs you know and invariably it was ones that didn't have the confidence to uh-huh you know some way or another to finish and realize that there was any other money anywhere except you know in dealing drugs but incredible incredible athletic abilities yeah well i know it's it's getting down to it's getting down to grade school now i think they really need to get away from you know from stressing the athletics and extra curricular activities and get even at the young age get get the politics and the money out of the athletics well a thing that we had here just recently and start getting back in the school and i i really i forgot to cut the article out i was mad at myself that i didn't because i wanted to follow up on it but there was man here in the Plano school system who had who has the premise that our grades in the metroplex in in you know some of these you know Irving and and uh Richardson Lake Highlands and Plano i think were his target ones are inflated artificially inflated grades uh-huh and he felt like those kids when they actually got in to college situations were not um able to pull the same  all right Cliff what kind of hobbies do you have too many too many not enough time for them all huh i have i uh have photography or i read a lot i also uh work with computers as both hobby and and work uh-huh and uh those are the main ones i suppose i also design kites really yeah wow that's interesting interesting well what all do you have to take into consideration when you design a kite the ones i like are the ones that are simple and cheap uh-huh i have one that i made from newspaper that uh you can't get much cheaper than old newspaper but it doesn't have any sticks or anything of that sort yeah it flies like a sled in other words are you uh have you made any money off your hobby oh no no my hobbies are hobbies yeah so what do you like to read when you read i read uh both nonfiction and fiction uh-huh most of the name brand authors and so forth yeah uh does that take up do you uh watch any TV or anything like that or oh yeah everybody watches TV i suppose but i uh i uh not married to it let's put it that way if i have a good book i would rather read it than watch TV yeah well that's good that's cool um how about yourself me i uh i play chess i uh lift weights play basketball ride bikes that's my exercise part of my hobbies i guess yeah and i read usually the Bible or some other type of Christian literature um let's see i like to play cards uh don't watch any TV though because we don't have a TV but uh every once in a while i'll sneak over to some friend's house and we'll watch a ball game or something uh we're just we're pretty much new in Texas so we're just trying to get into the lifestyle like we'd like to go see a rodeo sometime and and we my wife and i went to a one Ranger's game and we'd like to go a few more times maybe see Nolan pitch one time should have been out the other night right yeah exactly that would have been the best were you watching that game well we got to see the illegal broadcast that channel five had at the end of the game oh they were supposed to just show a quick flick and they it turned out that was the last batter that he was pitching to so they just stayed on the uh network and i understand that the producers got themselves in a little trouble they'll probably have to pay a yeah compensation of some sort for that oh that's terrible should showed a little bit of yeah but we got to see it anyway so they showed a little initiative showed a little bit oh yeah get your priorities in line see a little bit of history right where did you uh come to Texas from from Indiana from Indiana yeah my wife and i both went to Purdue and she got a job with Texas Instruments down here so i kind of followed her down here and i'm looking for employment or schooling or something on those lines the uh Sherman is far enough away from Dallas to be uh away from most of the the blithe that associate is associated with Dallas yeah they uh i work with Texas Instruments also uh-huh actually i've been with TI for thirty four years wow in research my wife originally came from Des Moines so she's from that turf up there yeah the Midwestern Corn Belt right yeah i was in the Kokomo uh last year uh late on in the year uh out to the Delco plant Delco Electronics out that way yeah were you just out on loan or something or they uh well we had we do a lot of uh work with automotives that's lots of T i parts on automotive uh things that don't have the TI bug on them oh we make uh anything anything that's uh metal clad for example aluminum bumpers that are metal clad and all sorts we have we make we make that in Massachusetts the uh a lot of the sensors that go there yeah when uh automatic chokes were common in automobiles well we had a hundred percent capture of the American market we made all the automatic chokes for Ford Chrysler Chevrolet wow all that so there's a lot of things like that that Texas Instruments makes that even the employees don't know they make for the most part no kidding i don't know that so the more a car becomes computerized the more TI becomes involved yeah we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well but what i described was mainly uh associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our Attleboro Massachusetts group does huh so how did you like Kokomo oh i liked it fine how long were you there uh only two days we we were out visiting uh Delco to show them some of the uh computerized map things that we had that sort of thing yeah well you said something about uh the blithe of Dallas uh do you live in Richardson yeah well we we haven't so been contaminated yet shall i say with the blithe but there's some older areas in Dallas and Oak Cliff that are pretty you wouldn't want to be out at night let's put it that way in that area yeah but that hasn't reached Richardson yet huh no no thank goodness and it's all the way across town it's on more on the south side than it is the north side anyway uh-huh but i guess all the older cities have that have that problem you say you play cards do you play bridge oh i had a friend that taught me how to play bridge we we get all these transplanted people here in Sherman not too many i don't know any one that's from Sherman now really uh a guy from New Mexico has been trying to teach us how to play bridge and we liked it we played a game called euchre which is i'm familiar with it you know euchre hey that's cool yeah right yeah my uh i was in the uh service right after college the Korean war going on uh-huh and my wife and i played uh all sorts of card games that we got out of uh book of Hoyle of which euchre was one that we learned yeah right pinochle uh flabbergash ever hear that i bet that's one you haven't heard of i've heard of it but i've never played yeah i read read Hoyle too not the whole book but yeah yeah yeah yeah looked through some of the games hey euchre's a big Indiana game Indiana and Illinois and Ohio yeah well in Texas of course the Texan game is with dominos playing forty two with dominos right it's it's a bidding game also but not like bridge you only go around one time with dominos huh and uh you probably haven't even heard of it but i'm i'm telling you that's a Texas game no okay that's a very uh very well known old timers Texas game lots of people uh play that so at least i got the scouting report yeah in fact that used to be called Baptist bridge because the Baptist don't believe in playing cards so you could but it's okay to play dominos so you so far forty two is called Baptist bridge that's funny wow do you do you play cards a lot or oh no i i like cribbage also that's a good game for two yeah and uh play backgammon or anything like that uh i haven't really gotten serious about it like the resurgence i played it in uh teams but uh-huh not until until it came back so to speak i haven't played that with the the doubling bet and so forth i figured a uh a computer man would be into chess well i uh had no one around me when i was growing up i uh solved chess problems and have several chess problem books you know mate and foremoves and that sort of thing which i enjoy but uh uh-huh yeah i didn't have a uh anyone else around me uh when i was growing up that was all that interested in chess i know all the moves and i can follow the game and that sort of thing and enjoy watching huh experts play yeah i participated one time with a uh grand master we used to have a chess club at Texas Instruments and uh we actually had a grand master in the area who came out and played all of us simultaneously you know yeah uh-huh and he also played us uh blindfold chess one one one on uh one and uh as the game was going along uh he says uh mate in six and if you play chess you know six is a long way ahead and uh we all looked at the board and couldn't figure out how he could possibly mate six and sure enough he mated in six just like he said he would yeah wow that's scary but he played us uh on a round robin where he walks around the tables and plays everybody how long ago was this oh it's been several years ago like uh probably ten years remember his name no it's too long ago uh i really don't but he was he was something else we had one member who's really uh in the professional class if you will he used to go to the matches all the time uh-huh and his let's see i've forgotten let's see the grand master and then right out of that's master what's the one that's just under master expert expert yeah he was expert uh-huh so uh he gave him a run for his money when he he had to be playing all of us but if he passed you uh twice uh you were out in other words if you hadn't moved when he went around so the more members he beat well the faster he got around and uh so Tony the yeah  okay what kind of do you have children okay yeah we have one that's seventeen one that's fifteen and one that's just now six oh okay and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace that would we could put Michael's because his birthday is the first of September and he was going to school at five um-hum oh so he started the first grade when he was five or started uh-huh yeah first grade when he was five years old and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five yeah so we could you know we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something right and it was uh that mediocore mediocre expensive it wasn't really that expensive but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something uh-huh to learn something and that's i mean that's even not only toddlers but you know even your older children yeah it's hard to find anywhere there really going to learn something and then yeah you do have to pay you know if you the better the place the more you're going to pay yeah well yeah but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway true very true if you know my my wife works so um-hum it costs us more for her to stay home more than it does for him to go to the babysitter so um-hum if i had any children i would uh i hope that i'll be in a position to stay home with my child because okay i'm not real uh uh trusting of a lot of people yeah see i don't know uh especially today people i work in the news business and i just see different things all the time yeah and people are just crazy these days they're crazy and and and i don't you know it takes me a takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend much less to you know trust someone with my with my child yeah well see we took our time and we checked it out and we found a preschool for him uh-huh uh-huh and it you know through other folks where i where i work i work at TI uh-huh so through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool it was actually at a licensed preschool you know we um-hum had those requirements hum so i guess that's the best way you know to get recommendations from your friends or family members yeah you know i well that and you know i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would i would have stayed home with him first um-hum before i left him somewhere that you know they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here and hum you know i just i i don't think i'd take that chance um-hum you know i think it's out of sight or out of mind for less than yeah yeah i mean you have to be you have to be sure that these people for more than a minute or so i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything but you just have to be sure that they're going to be watching them you know that they wouldn't let them drink something or but you never know yeah you know eat something off the floor you know just simple things that can be harmful yeah but you you know as far as brittle as child abuse is these days you never know um-hum you don't know who you can trust and who you can't um-hum and you hear so much you know on the news about you know uh child care places and also um senior care facilities you know and you hear abuse yeah yeah senior care is getting real bad and so you just you just don't know and you almost want to you know spend a couple of weeks with in class with your child just to see how it is or something yeah but so you have no children at all huh no i don't huh-uh gee no i'm do you miss that part in your life or uh no i'm only i'm twenty three yeah so i still have a little bit of time um it's just not in the cards for me right now i'm trying to get my career going yeah yeah i imagine yeah working in the news production anyway back to the subject and uh yeah yeah we should have discussed this earlier but anyway it's tough it really is it's hard to find um-hum um-hum good child care and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's going to be fine all day long uh-huh um-hum and you brought up a good point you know about learning you just don't want a babysitter you you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their ABC's or something you know get them and yeah you know and he's he's doing real well it it it has paid off for him he's in first grade now and he's you know got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level um-hum um-hum huh so you know those early ages when he would you know when his mom and dad are at work and he's actually in child care in a preschool not yes um-hum just child care you know we could have sent him to anybody you know there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but right um-hum sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something has paid off not only for us his his attitude is i think a little bit right um-hum tall for a six year old and you know but his did you take this same uh route with your other two children um they they were outside my marriage so okay i don't know um-hum i would say no but i was wondering how you know all my children excel they're they're really good and i guess no he learns from the older boys too but um-hum um-hum right and it helps that he has older brothers you know um just to have role models and things like that yeah yeah yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share but um-hum um-hum so we faced that too but hum he learns quite a bit he learned quite a bit from not only from nursery school but he learned quite a bit from the older boys and um-hum you know he's excelled and it's paying off for him it really is he's that's excellent he is pretty smart sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed but he is smart you know yeah um-hum well what kid isn't these days so but i think it's important i think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace i don't know you know how it is down there in Waco but in Lubbock we have a few that you can um-hum send your children to and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat um-hum do they have any kind of program like at TI or wherever your wife works and um some any kind of day care no not any huh-uh we just hum because i know they're they're putting that into a lot of uh corporations now yeah they're trying to the federal government is trying to insist on that too so right so maybe that'll be an option for no we don't yet well it would be nice you know there but then i i foresee that being just a babysitting thing not much learning but you know yeah there's not well kind of somebody to just watch your kid while your at work you know where where we sent Michael the first few years was there was different teachers all the time you know some girls were there in the morning and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day hum um-hum right you know and then he they had a group of kids and they put on skits and they put on plays and they did the Halloween thing and the Valentine's Day things um um-hum and it's you know it was important to us so we you know we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way hum do you think it would have been better for him to have um maybe one continuous teacher somebody to that he could um uh get attached to or is it better the other way with a lot of different no because i think you know as a child growing up i think is a task that belongs to his parents uh-huh i don't think he needed to be attached to too even though he did um-hum you know he attached himself to a couple of those but right i think his attachments at home and you know he gets the idea of what school is for and uh you know i have different teachers here and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach teach me another and hum no so i i i really can't say that it would be it's important for him to attach himself to anybody right um um-hum he did well you it it with another child i can't say that right because i don't have that experience yeah each child is individual as for as learning and things yeah see but i don't have that experience so i can't say that you know he did well so um-hum i don't think we made too many mistakes right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well we tried hard yeah he's doing real well um-hum well good and he learned from it so and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day you know babysat sounds to me like well you're here i guess i'll watch you when i get time you know maybe i'll clean my house maybe i'll cook you lunch maybe i won't um-hum um-hum um-hum you know and and they'll probably sit him in front of the television yeah yeah you know while they do other things yeah yeah and i don't you know i don't allow that when he's at home so um-hum but we had a good experience and we really did well yeah well that's good that's good so and he didn't he served better than we did you know he gained he actually gained from it you know sure we gained from it because we were allowed to continue our employment and uh-huh uh-huh continue our family but i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching TV and playing all day that's great right right and its important that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have my children i don't know when that will be but um yeah yeah you know just really look into it will it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure yeah well just because i i just want to be i want to be so positive that you know my children are okay yeah as well as the other children in the center you know well you know his his mom didn't go back to work till you know he was six months old um-hum and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere and make him feel like he wasn't wanted um-hum exactly and we wanted his center of attention at home but um-hum we did what we could and it it worked out real well i'm glad we were so careful it's difficulties but it's it's a lot more difficulties these days because you have both parents working a lot of times and so you have to find day care whereas you know here oh yeah you know well it most of the time now it's a necessity you can't afford um-hum um-hum so you know i'm not making seventy or thirty eighty thousand dollars a year so um-hum that's right it's pretty tough so child care's a necessity whereas years ago you know the husband basically worked and the wife basically stayed home yeah and mom mom was allowed to stay home and there was um-hum a few families outside of that where dad stayed home and mom worked but not very many that i know of when i was growing up um-hum and you know i'm forty now but um-hum i know when i was a kid mom was always at home right so we didn't i think that has a lot to do with just just all children how they learn and things just because the basic family is is breaking you know the basic family is not there anymore yeah it is yeah it is i'll agree with that it is it's it's not there um-hum you know i think that plays a big part in in a child's learning and you know what they can and cannot do in child care yeah i would think  okay are you on any kind of uh regular exercise plan i i yeah i'm yeah i i do aerobics uh step classes and um toning classes yes step classes what's that it's um it's a new uh form i think uh it's like low impact aerobics but at it oh instead of hopping and jumping your just stepping um-hum yeah you you have a step and you literally step up on the step and move your arms it's it's it's it's new it's fun oh okay huh i probably couldn't do that because of my knee uh-huh bad knee yeah um and uh i do toning a lot and uh some every once in a while i play tennis yeah i'm not too great at it but i i try to play yeah i've i've kind of gotten out of the habit myself i mean it's i guess what i do now is i play softball right now that's about well right now i'm on two teams so it's four nights a week but uh um-hum gosh uh so i enjoy it but um-hum as far as you know uh instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there i went and bought a weight bench and don't ever hardly use it need to need to make myself do that uh-huh right yeah yeah i slacked off a little because of um i'm about to graduate from college and so this past couple months have been really hectic so i haven't really gone and i've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out but what school you going to i'm at East Carolina oh but um no i uh my step classes and toning is about the only thing well i mean now what's what's toning is that lifting lifting weights it's it's um like isolated movements for each muscle certain muscles groups you can do with oh okay isometrics stuff like that yeah you can do it with certain you know you can do it with weights if you wanted to but you know you leave out of there usually the next morning if you haven't done it in a while you wake up the next morning you're like oh no what did i do to myself and your whole body aches you know um yeah i know i'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape uh i feel like i'm out of shape but i feel guilty for not going because i really i'm i'm so used to going for you know three or four years now but um um-hum yeah i stayed in pretty good shape during school i played baseball all the way through and you know working out six hours a day usually six or seven days a week that kind of kept us all in pretty good shape uh-huh oh yeah oh yeah but uh ever ever since i got out of school you know just jumped right into the job and um-hum i guess the job that i'm in it's stuff to stay on any kind of a regular schedule uh-huh because i work some weird hours and do some traveling and uh-huh no some um i walk a lot because uh you know being in in school we i don't know if your campus was anything like ours but our parking lot's in one end of the of the campus and the school the buildings are all at the other end so yeah no i didn't have well much of a problem we i guess i went to a small Baptist school and we had about when i was there maybe thirteen hundred people so it's pretty small yeah uh-huh oh okay that's if yeah yeah but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant um-hum so yeah it's uh i live i live on the second story apartments so i walk up and down stairs all day long so uh uh we've got a one story house now that's that's enough i guess i push the lawn mower around that's fairly regular yeah that's one of the exercise now i i um yeah would like to start running i've never been much of a runner but i want to start i want to run but i don't i don't know if i'll be able to to do it what just because you you don't like to or because because you won't be able to i'm i'm afraid i won't be able to i wish i'd oh if you do if you do aerobics you shouldn't have any problem running yeah i hope not oh we've we've ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough uh-huh i don't even own a bike i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about twelve so uh i don't know i'd be afraid afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike you know no you can't forget how to ride a bike yeah but um no i guess that's about the only form i'm trying to think of of other things that i do that would be considered exercise or things i should do yeah now when i was going to i i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred well when we were at this junior college uh i know our coach you know we one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting uh-huh so they uh i mean it was a regular i mean we had it for course credit but still i mean it was pretty high impact stuff uh-huh those aerobic classes are are tough the the high impact um-hum definitely are are tough classes yeah and she'd uh you know most of the guys were all in one class so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally you know uh-huh first thing eight i think we had eight o'clock in the morning was our class uh-huh wake up well now they have those uh those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight you have like bands i don't know if you've seen them they're um-hum yeah i think my wife has some yeah they're they're weird they're uh you get uh they're just made of i guess it's different kinds of rubber uh and they get um-hum or sand even some of them well no they're elastic so i guess it wouldn't be sand uh-huh and there's some that like the different colors denotes how much they how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move hum uh there's like i know there's purple gray and uh green and some of them are real short and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use you know yeah but uh those classes i i enjoy uh i think uh with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun if you don't have one that's fun and not enjoy it look not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing the class is not going to get out uh what they should get out of the class yeah uh if the so are you going to get into instructing well what are you studying oh i'm an interior design major oh okay not in the not in the aerobic instructor type field oh no no no no oh i could never do that i don't think i'd rather just be the student yeah and uh oh occasionally i do the weights at the health club but low weights just yeah the uh the some of the Nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting i mean they they they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups um-hum with those things but man they are ah uh i don't know to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there and workout and then drive back um-hum right well they um i just noticed at our health club they they put on these computerized one these computerized machines and you set a speed on it and the weight and it and it makes you do it and it tells you like if you're going too slow it will say my grandmother could do this faster than you and stuff like a turtle goes faster and um it tells it and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you a little negative reinforcement there while you're going yeah so uh do that stuff like that but just i've never used those machines i just use the regular machines and the free weights you know like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights yeah just to do you know some bicep tricep exercises sit-ups of course yeah that's that's where i'm really starting to get noticeable i'm just getting real soft in the middle uh-huh oh yeah i think that's uh number one problem with everyone um-hum i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about four years ago uh-huh but i've just myself i just notice myself just really real soft and i'm sure i don't have near the endurance that i did yeah but i i intend i keep saying i intend to get back into it uh-huh yeah i just need to put the old nose to the grindstone i i i guess at that point it would turn into a task um-hum i don't consider it fun doing that but right yeah i plan on getting back once i graduate next weekend next weekend all right next weekend yeah one week then i plan to get right back into it you know it's it does a lot for you i think makes you feel a lot better yeah oh no yeah there there's no no question the the end result is great and i i mean i enjoyed you know we when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired you know uh-huh and i mean you feel so much better about yourself just that you know yeah um-hum you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner oh i still don't but oh yeah yeah well good luck on your graduation and your alrighty well thank you it was nice talking to you okay bye-bye yeah you too bye  right what what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force yeah few are uh basically staying home and being homemakers and raising kids exclusively uh-huh yeah i i i grew up in uh sixties and early seventies and uh my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up she didn't start working until i was um well into high school uh-huh so i i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids yeah true well mine taught kindergarten but she was always uh i guess her schedule was shorter so she was always uh home always home by the time you got home yeah yeah that that statistic i guess has been growing every year it's it's something around sixty sixty five percent or so now uh-huh uh i'm not sure what the future holds for that whether it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots um effort or whatever going on i i um clean houses part-time and almost all the people that i clean for believe it or not are mothers that don't work uh-huh um that's unusual they're all um it's and it's i think it's kind of a new movement it's going back towards you know women have come into the work force in the last twenty thirty years and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where you know women stayed home with the kids you know and try to give the kids quality time uh-huh and i i think that in the future you're i think you're going to see a lot more women choosing to not work after they have a baby yeah um i think with uh the uh the work force with the the salaries that a lot of a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are um vice presidents of companies and i think with uh um it seems like it's more the upper-class people uh-huh um i don't see it as much the like in my situation where i don't i don't have children yet but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids but realistically that's i'm i'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible um for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income yeah that is tough yeah we're looking at that now my wife's about six months along uh-huh i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids uh-huh you know it's going to kind of kind of go along with the BMW in the driveway and or in the garage or whatever um and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever true yeah i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home i would think it would be women that were working full-time yeah believe it or not though the all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home um they're real active in volunteer work huh uh-huh um one of the women is real active with uh muscular dystrophy and uh does a lot of of work with them on a volunteer basis but it's still it's almost like a job but she just doesn't get paid for it huh well i guess that's good they got something to keep them active yeah when when your wife has her baby is she going to stay home or is she going to go back to work yeah we're going to try and have her stay home for as long as possible what do you think that that that i would i would like to be able to do that yeah we think it's uh that important and i i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction i'm a a counselor and a therapist and i work with adolescents and um-hum i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure yeah i i see a difference in the generation of even the generation before me uh-huh uh were you know mom was like um Mrs Cleaver uh you know June Cleaver or whatever where the the attitudes were a lot different um as far as i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more um there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and um-hum um a lot of the the things that are going on in today's society i think morally um it seems like there was the people people were a lot better back then as far as having higher standards true huh well the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure and and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too so kids are raised around their friends and by the media yeah yeah that's true and i think i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future that's contributed yeah maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time so if there was some way for for women to to stay home even if they could work you know there are a lot of jobs that are coming about like in computers at home and those types of things that would um-hum at least in some ways bridge the gap yeah i think that um in the future um the the family unit as it as it once was known is is going to be nonexistent where do how do what do you think about uh as far as do do you think there's going to be still a family unit or or do you think that um the trend is going more towards single parenting they'll understand them the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so and it got higher than that for a while um it's hard to say families are such a strange configuration anymore um i i see a lot of families where you know in the in the back i grew up about the same time you did um-hum back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible uh-huh nowadays it's not the case kids don't kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk and one of the reasons i guess is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working they get bombarded with junk and they don't have to do anything around the house they never learned to be responsible when the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while and they come back and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad yeah so know you create a bigger bigger family generation after generation but not really on purpose yeah yeah so it's not not a real functional situation anyway i don't know it's i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families and the blended families as long as we 've got so many other crazy things going on in society yeah i i think that eventually the the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are um you know two parent families uh-huh that's pretty sad yeah it is i guess unless unless there's a a major swing in the change of what's important to people you know probably keep going downhill and i i don't know we we feel like that that we can make it on one income it it may be tough but we may have to give up some some things i i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that it'll make the yeah the strain worthwhile yeah i think so too well i need to go ahead and and wrap it up it was really nice talking to you okay well i've enjoyed it Stephanie and uh thanks a lot okay bye bye uh-huh bye-bye  okay official time well what do you think of about the budget here you first oh well i think it needs some drastic uh drastic drastic help um oh yeah i i think there's a lot of waste that that could uh that would be cut out if we could get uh politicians to be less less of politicians um and um i i think it needs to be given a really high priority because i i think it has a horrible effect on the economy and and what we can do as a country and everything else i know that we're affected uh directly uh at TI because of uh the defense budget cuts but i certainly think that's one of the the things that they're doing already which is uh which which was needed to be done for probably the last few years uh sure right yeah although with the Russian situation and all the world situation changing the way it is uh it certainly needed i the obvious one that people all talk about that i still don't understand is uh i'm at work let me turn my radio off here uh is uh all the foreign aid i you know it's over it's a fifty years roughly since World War II yeah yeah i don't understand why we're i understand that we support Israel and all the other countries but why do we have to give them cash rather than just selling them military things at a discount or something i don't get the idea the idea of giving people three billion dollars a year yeah right i i have a hard time with that too now i can understand uh for instance the uh the situation in say the Philippines where they needed some cash to jump start their economy yeah but i don't see where we i mean i think it's crazy to be just pouring money into an economy that's obviously mismanaged for instance um right well i think that we should give humanitarian aid and that's it right you know i think we can loan food or or relief relief aid or whatever you want to call it but i yeah right not cash money i think you can send them wheat in other words i think that helps farmers but right to send them money i don't i don't yeah see under any circumstances where you send anybody money i'm not sure i understand the i i guess there's a a a reason for that and i i just don't know enough about it to understand the sense of it because it's not an obvious i i mean on the surface there's no obvious reason why we should be doing that right i have to agree with you there i'm amazed that neither neither party or or the which i guess they're independent parties too why they don't talk about it i mean they don't bring it up at all why you would think they'd be real having a real campaign with one party or the other right yeah and they never talk about it they just keep doing it you know yeah that there's some kind of justification there and i don't know what it is and i don't know if i agree with it or not yeah i i just like to hear them talk about it you know i like to hear some of the congressmen or senators at least right say well let's let's bring this before let's examine every one of our foreign aids right and look like like they did with the defense with the military bases they they investigated all those rightfully wrongly wrongfully whether which ones should be closed i don't know right at least they looked at it i think they should look at foreign aid and say hey which ones do we not need to give you know right well you know the the the other thing is that you have all this this this all this partisan politics where you have a person who's representing a particular state and he says well my my state it would advantageous if the if the United States spent money to uh you know to investigate uh potato blithe or something you know and that's and there is tons of that and right yeah i know that is amazing and that is just a horrible waste of money i think and it's and it's done because some constituent you know i well it's done because they want to impress the the people that are going to vote for him next month um-hum and uh if if there was a way to get around that and i think i think some of that could be avoided if we put uh uh a finite term on on some of these peoples um uh uh you know stay in office um oh i agree with you there i i think they would have they wouldn't have time to i mean they'd have to i think their incentive would be to go out uh or and making their mark on history and they wouldn't even be wasting their time on little piddly stuff that's just draining draining money uh instead they'd concentrate on doing something that was significant um i would hope so anyway yeah i saw one about a month or so ago on Twenty Twenty i think it was where one of the congressmen i think it was from Connecticut and i probably will will screw that up but yeah he wanted to start another drug headquarters in his state and no one was asking for it but him and he got the money approved got it approved by tagging it on to some other bill yeah and it didn't you know the the newsman asked him what what no one is asking for this why do you you know and it was just totally a boondoggle i mean it was just uh him wanting to build something that nobody wanted yeah sure right well that's that's you know that's the catch word these days is drug you know drug fight drug right right i mean he got himself but the drug agency wasn't asking for it he was asking for it you know which didn't make any sense at all yeah i don't know he it looked can look good on his resume resume right it is amazing how the the congressmen and senators just start are totally in another world once they get elected yeah yeah oh yeah and well you know it's like i've i've really gotten cynical i guess as i've gotten older but i've i've been watching you know the the campaigns and stuff and it's it just it's just amazing how little anybody really says right or well duh i thought you were going to say what they do oh that too i i've been trying to go over in my own mind when they say we're gonna really if you vote for me we're gonna control crime and drugs they don't do anything nothing they don't have they had any president or anybody every done anythin g against crime and drugs you know right right well no no i mean and because it's you know and it's because nothing is black and white right you know you just can't go up and go up there and say well we're going to we're going to stop crime now right yeah exactly if it were that simple somebody would have done it a long time ago right exactly and that's what kind you know they there's the people that says well we'll we'll never raise taxes or we will raise taxes or you know it's like the guy who says you're never going to raise taxes doesn't isn't realistic about what he sees about what he's doing the guy who says well we should raise taxes right will raise them but but it will all it the money will not help anything that's what kills me um you know the for instance here here in Texas they're talking about uh an income tax well i could almost support an income tax if they reduced or got rid of the sales tax right yeah you can't double up yeah but nobody's talking about that they want both you know no i know and they never go away they just get higher and there's more of them you know exactly exactly they never go away the the funniest thing i heard lately about politicians uh joke was uh uh do you know how you can tell it when a politician is lying his lips are moving yeah my favorite yeah yeah yeah my favorite one about politicians is that a politician's a person who's made it to the top because he didn't have what it takes to make it at the bottom that that that that see that covers is all you know right yeah but it it is the budget thing is just and i don't know why they don't talk about it logically it's always always uh yeah again the only thing i guess they're doing logically now is the defense which is certainly hurting TI to a degree although we've done so well with the yeah Gulf War we got a lot of good positive press with all the exotic uh weapon systems and i think we'll get a lot of those you know but uh right yeah uh you you need to close so many bases and you need to cut out some missiles or i mean some uh programs and all right uh and they're doing that i think that's that's really good even though it it hurts a lot bit you know well yeah the the problem is that the budget is so complicated and what they're doing are the things that are easy they're making the easy choices well then that's probably true and and uh um and it's and i think part of it is that the budget you know the the economy and the budget is too complicated for a lot of the politicians i mean they can't comprehend um you know what it takes what it needs they just don't have the expertise the other thing is they can't it's too um-hum uh it's not in their political career interest to make some of the hard decisions that are going to need to be made right uh and so what you do is you do the obvious things you know and and they they don't really help all that much i mean sure they help some and i'm sure right i don't go ahead i was going to say i know you mentioned it but i don't know why we can't change the laws where there the congress and the senators just have eight years or or terms because the president has it right and i think that uh is you know you don't want someone in there forever right and the congressmen go in there forever and that's that's their whole life then right right and their family's life and every one of their relatives gets on it has got a job you know it's ridiculous yeah well uh you know i think uh it's got to come from the you know it's it's got to be you know there certainly the politicians aren't going to introduce that as a bill so so so you know if something like that's going to happen it's usually because somebody's right there you go there you go you know somebody has gotten angry enough and has got the time an the energy to to you know have to to develop something from the from the you know ground swell level you know where you get a petition up and you you know get signatures and you call for a referendum and it's not easy it's not easy no that's true maybe that long-term though i think that is a a factor that is to keep the our government uh rotating you know keep them moving uh yeah and not get the career politicians huh right yeah there's uh historians i thought that keep saying will that that never was meant that the politicians would make a career it was just something that you would serve like in the military right and then you'd be done you know that's right well you know it and and what was supposed to be uh so healthy about our our former government is that these were regular people who were who you know these were the doctors and the lawyers and the accountants and the janitors and the uh who were in there for their brief period of time to do their to to to serve proudly and right right right right right  okay sure go ahead what kind of books do you like to read oh i like all kinds of books yeah mostly uh something i like like true life um-hum not uh you know documentaries or real stories about real people and that kind of stuff or dramas in real life uh-huh and uh i also like romantic novels i like uh i like Readers' Digest believe it or not i usually read that from cover to cover yeah so do i yeah i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it right you know that kind of a thing uh as far as like real novels i haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing um-hum i wish i had in some in some senses but i don't have time really as much as i would like to to get into that kind of thing how about you um well i like like you said real life um i like uh biographies of people's lives like especially like athletes for some reason it seems to interest me like people that make a big comeback or uh-huh sure you know Orel Hershiser things like that uh-huh and um i like to read books on improve like family marriage you know things that are written by like Christian authors or um doctors about family and you know how to improve your home and all that kind of thing um i like to read the magazines i to read like i like to read Readers' Digest i read a lot of bicycling magazines they're i mainly look at the pictures and stuff but they just usually have some good articles in them uh-huh but uh i don't know i haven't really found any romance type stuff i like to read i i'm more true you know fiction uh nonfiction i haven't found a lot of uh fiction books that i really like yeah yeah but uh not to say i wouldn't eventually i mean what was the last book you read yeah uh jeez let me think it i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time and it i can't even really remember uh i think it was a romantic novel by Danielle Steel or one of those you know yeah honestly um i don't do as much reading like i say as i would like to really yeah we've been working a lot of hours at work and really yeah and then of course we have a home so it's i know you know a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or you know that type of thing yeah i set i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than i would have read last year but so far i've only read like two books and so i'm not doing very well but but see i do crafts too so it's hard i if i have a minute that's what i do i do yeah yeah i find it's real hard i let papers newspapers stack up and magazines stack up if i don't really set aside a time to look or or read them and that's the and and that's like myself i've i've i've miss it because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too yeah i really do and um i don't know it seems like you can get lost in a book you know it it it's like an escape for me i don't know about you uh-huh yeah yeah yeah it's if i'm really interested in what i'm reading i mean hours can go by and i i look up at the clock and say oh my word you know uh-huh in fact i'd rather read sometimes than watch TV yeah oh i would too um but i think you get out of the habit like you say you have to like kind of set yourself kind of train your mind yep have you ever read uh or heard of the book This Present Darkness no that was one of the books i read this year and it's really fast paced and intense it was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book but it was a real it was one of the best i've read i mean it was it was real good and it was um it was one of the few books that like it you know just hurry up and go through without putting down you know yeah right see that's the other problem i have if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading um-hum then i have a terrible time getting away from it too i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning you know because i'm so engrossed in it and then before you know it it's time to get up and go to work you know that type of thing yeah that's why i i don't know i'm i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that even if i'm uh doing something like an afghan if i'm close to the end sometimes i'll do the same thing uh-huh i don't know what you would call it maybe i have a problem no i'm sure it's it's terrible i i really like books that that you can get into and that's sense fast or something uh-huh i know what you mean i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes i just sleep better or something oh yeah you do you kind of get relaxed that's true but uh i have a lot of craft books that i have too and uh magazines i like People you know those things that are about real people uh-huh and um i i like to uh read about people who've been a successful you know who've who made a success of their lives yeah which what book have you read that is along those lines uh that was really good to to to give you specific titles i can't i can't like i say haven't done it in well how about who in such a long time do you know who it was about um well i went to uh seminar on uh it was for by American business and some of the people uh what the heck was his name i'm trying to think he's one of the uh Paroe and um it was more like oh it there was tapes and things that they had about him too how he started out as just a salesman and now he's you know multimillionaire and that type of thing and uh how you have to uh be aggressive and you know really want something for yourself and that type of stuff uh-huh it's like up to you in other words whatever happens in your life it's not up it's not someone else you have to do it yeah and i find t hat fascinating that people you know can do that kind of thing yeah just make up their minds that that's it you know have this one direction and then do it do it i can't i'm not that focused on something i i'm off in all directions um and i'm not uh um a planner which i wish i was uh-huh you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it uh-huh well that's all right i know i know but i wish i was more the other way you're more fun though see you're not ridged right yeah right i i that's see i like it that way though i i i would i don't want to change that part of me that's funny uh even though i admire someone who isn't that's good yeah like i am you know and and i wish i could be more that way but there may be some schools you could read about and learn that's true that's true how many people do you supervise uh about twenty oh that's not bad that's not bad at all no no do you like your job sometimes sometimes more than others but yeah i do i've been there about three years oh that's oh that's important do you have a family yeah i just got married last year and um most of my family's in Indiana oh uh-huh so i've only been in Texas three years do you like it yeah i do i love the weather down here i i loved i loved Abilene too that's what i liked too is the weather yeah i know except for tornados boy they they have storms here i've yes they do and it it it's so surprising how it just happens you know hail and thunder and yeah unpredictable were you here during the hailstorm two years ago uh no oh i've been up here about three uh we were down there uh from eighty six to eighty five to eighty six no uh eighty well part of eighty four to eighty six i should say yeah boy i had thirty three hundred dollars damage done on my car a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail oh wow i think State Farm went bankrupt just about oh jeez i know the whole situation is bad but uh up here we're having a terrible time with the recession really yeah yeah it's not good at all hm i know things are pretty booming down there i heard they sold Johnson City though yeah and Colorado Springs and Colorado Springs yeah i talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day and he was telling me about it oh wow they just sold it amazing closed up and moved down to McKinney oh well that's good at least they kept the business part of it yeah it's scary though i'm telling you i know i don't know and well you know with the other part of this thing was how do you feel that this influences family how do i feel what that that books influence do you know how to use them in your life or to influence uh-huh i i feel like it's important for young children to read too and what you read to them yeah when my children were were younger of course they were all married and grown and i have grandchildren now they were uh i i read to them a lot that's good and uh i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also i'm not saying they read all the right things but they do read uh where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all and i think it's important that's real yeah oh yeah because uh even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens i mean they don't learn anything it's because they can't read yeah it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school and that i work with and people i mean i get memos all the time across my desk and things are misspelled and it's really yeah oh it's so unbelievable isn't it it's pretty sad a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read you know yeah exactly and i think that that's why reading is so important yeah because uh i think even mentally when you can do some  uh you know i when i was much younger uh than i am now i i had wanted to go to the Peace Corps and uh seems like i it it was something that i i really wanted wanted to do can you speak up please seems like wanting to go to the Peace Corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young yes but uh i don't believe they accept you after you you know after you're married and you have uh kids and all that so i got into that and i wasn't able to uh to uh participate but they will accept you later in life also oh they will yeah after your children are grown oh i didn't know that yes then there's no age limit no your kidding no i'm not some of the people that have been involved with Peace Corps among other things were retired teachers uh there was a retired plumber that went to uh uh Uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing you know providing for a for better public hygiene goodness i'm surprised i really had no idea yeah but so do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country well i don't i don't really think that they should they should be it should be mandatory i mean why well i don't know i it's that just might not be something that everybody wants to do i mean there are a lot of people who would like to do it and there are a lot of people who get into other things and they get all involved and they just you know don't want to or don't have the time well i understand but if it were told to us that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and uh twenty sixth birthday to give a year or two to the to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the Peace Corps or something you know the military service or something wouldn't we have uh maybe a better class of Americans i don't see how that can can make a better class of Americans to make everybody to make it mandatory for everybody to participate a lot of these people a lot of our uh pardon the terminology but yuppies now are interested in one thing and one thing only and that's themselves that's true well i don't i don't think that and at least if you legislated giving for a couple years of their lives or or uh a actually purely giving but but some sort of equitable exchange then at least the country would have gotten two years from them where hum they would have given something to the country instead of take taking away all their lives yeah are are you suggesting then that if if uh if i have to go and and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way uh i i will be compensated for this i'm not just going to give them your time give them your entire life for two years no okay it will be a job of sorts i'm sure that the Peace Corps pays it doesn't pay well it's not top wages um-hum but but it does pay um-hum the military for young hiring in soldiers does pay it doesn't pay well um-hum okay currently in our country especially in some regions there's an employment problem that that that's true but in even in our region there's an employment problem there's a lot of uh you're aware of that i'm sure people gotten laid off lately you know from companies like General Dynamics and Texas Instruments and Texas Instruments thousands and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs you know in in another time we had the WPA no no Works Progress Administration i'm not familiar with that during the great depression oh i though i can't see why it was great uh that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare um-hum and the minimum wage i see and that was that was some some some program where people gave their time in trade for in trade for money some money okay and and living they gave them food and uniforms and uh here in Colorado you'll find a great many things public roads that were worked on by the WPA uh dams that were built by the WPA uh scenic overlooks parks um-hum we are road our road system's falling apart our our national road system system of highways um-hum and roads is falling apart well then i guess there are a lot of a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country there there's a lot of work to be done um-hum i really i really don't see anything wrong with it i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that i i can't see the problem in it for a year the well what what i'm saying is that if it were mandatory that every person right after graduation from high school uh-huh that were able bodied um-hum would give a year well or not give a year but but trade a year then they at least one not more than say three or four then it would definitely effect unemployment all right i wonder if if they didn't make it mandatory if they would actually get enough people volunteering to to to do it that it you know that they would have enough i don't know i mean i i probably well you know Texas New Mexico Colorado huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system um-hum there's Aid to Dependent Children and Aid to Mothers of Dependent Children but there's no real welfare system uh-huh but if we took these people off off the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else and who knows maybe some of our graduating high school seniors might would find out a little bit more the what the traditional American work ethic means you know we have had some problem with that in recent years oh well yes we have with with uh recent generations i i know exactly what you are talking about i i mean i know several people who do not wish wish to work uh they wish only for the paycheck well they wish for the money and they they decide that they're going to get the money anyway they can with you know without uh without without working in the the traditional American really producing job market yeah be it selling drugs or whatever right so what i'm saying they they get the money anyway they can yeah yeah and maybe if we instilled the work ethic you know i enjoy the i enjoy working yeah  so how do we fix the national budget okay damned if i know um i don't uh i suspect uh let's see i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes but Lord knows you shouldn't one shouldn't say that well i i i suspect we should probably have an independent auditing agency go in and look at how the government spends money and work from there that would probably be good because i because i don't think they're very good at it but something that the government hasn't been looking at is the source of the problem um the true source of the problem is A that we do spend too much yes but also B that we don't take in enough yeah well why why why why do you say that actually uh too few Americans are working hum if more Americans were working and meaningful good paying labor yes and paying taxes rather than using taxed and the tax structure was fair between the lowest and the highest income Americans then we would have more money there to play with oh that's interesting yeah that's probably true i mean well we also we'd be spending less because all the money that that normally goes to support those people aren't working it's back in the system right so you're right that's a real neat idea well what but i mean what can you know at at some point what can you do to sort of raise revenue i mean to raise jobs i wonder well i hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to affluence but in fact in some cases that's what we ought to do oh okay so start when not Reaganomics thank you but that is not gonna work uh uh what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space hum and that way just create more jobs well or whatever at some point there there will be enough jobs for most of the able able-bodied Americans hum um-hum well that's a neat idea we also need to uh assure that there's some work in the private sector yeah that's what that's what you you think space would do that much for that or i think it would do something for it i think we would fill up new technologies but i think we should also hum do something rather radical like what legalize marijuana oh you think you think that would uh have a major effect well that would put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway what that that might have a um a good effect on on on crime anyway yes uh okay i think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals i think it would put reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another that's probably true i think that i think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax and probably a lot of and probably a lot of and really receive some revenues from yeah but that's potentially you know uh if you look at prohibition historically it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues um-hum um no i'd never thought about that then i think once we put money back into the coffers in the coffers of the federal government um-hum and get the federal government to where there's money there again we should reduce the amount of money and this would have to come rather quickly and would have to come come originally also where we're not paying in some cases we do pay more for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment that's true we do often times they are paid more yeah and you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means right that's just sensible on their part that's just what on their part i'm sorry i missed that it's just sensible on their parts to go after the oh the the greater amount of income um-hum so if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage then more people will get off welfare that that maybe true that's very true you know give them a true incentive to want to work right and then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure exactly where we're at with unemployment right that's uh reduce immigration um-hum or eliminate it entirely for a few years unti l we get our own house in order yeah and maybe even reduce along along the same lines maybe reduce imports as well i think oh absolutely absolutely i mean we don't need to buy other people's stuff right now that's right when we're in a wor ld of hurt well i don't i'm not going to say that we ought to reduce reduce them through legal means i think we ought to just tax them severely right well that that's what happened in other country though and other places they tax us quite heavily i mean they tax American imports quite heavily so we could do the same thing i mean just and you know they may get it seems only fair right it does seem only fair i mean why not and i think really if we got all those that are able-bodied into the work force reduced the amount going out for those purposes created new jobs for that work force there would be plenty of money i i think so and then at that point yes quit spending on space force it all into the into the private sector oh really oh really i love the switch well at that point you might we it it it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly you know we would be that's right we would be able to keep it wherever we wanted to in space or the ocean research whatever we wanted to do but i think that would be uh uh space was just a convenient place for me to go because right that would put a lot of a lot of Millspec and NASA work operates to the same demanding specifications that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work um-hum right is compared to defense well that's a good idea well i well the other thing and the other thing i i i think we seriously need to do is um like i say have someone go in and look and you know and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something you know what causes that greed i suspect uh no your your your buying large trunk uh the government specification um-hum sheets of paper for building a pair of BVD underwear for the federal government yes is twenty two foot tall really if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another for making the government issue under wear for making government issue underwear Jesus to just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines costs the company um-hum a huge amount of money well its potentially a fault of the government than i mean that could be thing like that should be i mean yes a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor right well that's a i had never heard that before uh a huge amount of what you hear on about the seventy five dollar hammers right and the nine hundred dollar toilet seats doesn't come from people in the industry it comes from senators that don't know anything about it hum uh my job is government tooling specialist oh okay so you know about some of these things yeah  the basic question is too much and i don't know my my opinion i guess here in North Carolina they announced that May second was the uh tax day that's when you everything you've earned so far has gone to taxes the rest of the year is yours that represents about a third of your income and i don't know uh who came up with that figure but i think it really comes out to be more than the third but uh i i don't know i find myself in a position sort of like selective approval almost like the United Way campaign where you agree with most of the agencies but uh don't agree with some of them and i think that we could have less tax by cutting out some of the the uh programs that we support but overall i guess we're pretty fortunate nature nation as far as the amount of tax that we have to pay how do you feel well i i've lived overseas you know it's with in the Army and i see what kind of taxes they pay in other countries yeah i've done some business overseas in in Latin America and of course know about the we hear about Sweden with their uh social program but you don't hear what the cost is same in Europe in Britain and other nations much higher tax rates but the it just seems as if from the time i've been following politics which was i guess about seventy five really got interested in politics and keeping up with it it just seems since that time the bureaucratic machine has just gotten so out of control oh yes and then they scream about that that or the uh politicians scream about they're going to try and not raise taxes but they vote in a raise for themselves every year oh yes that that's the uh the type of thing that really irritates me where they can get significant increases when everyone else is facing layoffs or or cutbacks or uh equating it to a personal income situation and yet it's almost automatic or it's hidden and uh i think they need to bite the same bullet that most individuals do the one of the other problems that i have recently is centered on such things as the trip by Dan Quayle to Augusta Georgia to play golf and i realize that constant communication is necessary especially when Bush had his heart rhythm problem this weekend but we can always send jets for someone i think if if they're out of pocket rather than accepting it as the norm for a nice golfing trip so that's what i meant about the selectives some things i think we're doing extremely wrong could save a lot of money but other things uh like i enjoy seeing money spent on the Smithsonian Institute in Washington i think it's one of the nicest national treasures and i love to see kids of uh any background roaming through and seeing such great collections but then when when we talk about all the foreign aid that we give away that bothers me a lot i don't know how to solve the problem though when as you said the uh bureaucracy gets out of hand regardless of who you vote for the bureaucracy continues too i i have trouble understanding the entire concept of foreign i understand going into countries where they've had natural disasters and going in and giving relief aid that way uh-huh but paying for their these countries to run their own governments oh i think it's way i i've got a big hang-up with that it's way out of hand i'm almost turning into an isolationist which is not not a good attitude in in global uh communications and everything that we have this these days but it's a matter of uh i hate to see money thrown away and that's what i really i equate to some of our foreign aid policies it just seems like they keep saying we're helping this country or we're helping that country out and they wouldn't our money be better spent helping here at at home i agree i think that's i have some problem with social programs at home in terms of making it too convenient to be on on welfare that's something i would and that subject in itself i'd love to see that entire thing revised oh yeah yeah i i think when you get to a point where it's more economical to stay on welfare than it is to get a job you've got a basic concept problem something's got to change yeah you know and turn drastically but i i think uh if we're going to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home than overseas too and that there's some unusual things which can occur in the foreign aid uh by a stroke of a pen i think our president can forgive foreign debt and that's a lot of power vested in one one person in our system of uh governance and i've seen that happen over the last few years and you and i are paying for it but Jim it comes back a lot to the same thing that you said initially you've been overseas and have seen other places and i guess we're still fortunate but i think we're just i just want us to be smarter than we are well we've got it's not like this country doesn't have the people with the knowledge we've got it uh-huh we've got people that are willing to make change but as long as you've got career politicians that spend twenty five to forty five years in Washington playing power broker they're not going to do anything to tap tap out the well yeah well your your neighbor to the north Oklahoma just voted for state legislators uh one term no let's see i forget was it one term or two term fixed uh incumbency in other words they can't be reelected reelected after i think maybe the second term now that's something i would love to see happen not only in all the states but in the federal legislatures too federal yeah two terms then they got to sit out one yeah i think it takes away the issue of of a lot of the uh special lobbyist groups and everything else creating the incumbent uh about invincibility invincibility but there's another problem with that i'd we've got some good ones and i hate to see them leave but it i guess it's hard to to really uh identify which are the good and which are the bad the electorate seems to be putting them all back in and i thought this last election would be different but it it turned out it really wasn't and i think the thing about the ones that are really up there doing what they were elected to do it doesn't matter if they're in that office or not if they have to sit out a term fine they're going to be able to do things behind the scenes either in the capacity of the lobbyist or in working within their party of of the state or national level to get things enacted uh-huh that's not going to slow them down at all uh it doesn't solve the non elected bureaucrats bureaucrats either that's that's an issue i think that really fits into it because there are a lot of people that sit in the same position and really don't give a hoot who gets elected they still kind of run the show and and setup all the roadblocks and the the uh horrendous regulations and everything else but it's uh it's our system i think now we have to figure out how to really manage it well i think compared to the other systems that are out there without a doubt we've got probably the best system it just needs some fine tuning uh-huh uh-huh i think that's right well well the quest ion is who who's ready to put their hand on the first wrench and tighten the first bolt yeah How do you feel about the information we get uh from Congress that that affects us as far as the uh knowledge to to elect the right people i have i have a real problem federal register for instance uh you can have almost put anything in there you want to no it's not in the federal register what's the uh the congressional record uh someone can put in information retroactively to that to show that they supported something or uh trying to get the um politicians to actually truthfully report what they did vote for what they didn't vote for when they were actually on the floor at their desk is almost is going to be impossible to do yeah it there is no accountability of them and at any given time if you've been to Washington  well i currently don't have a pet although uh i have in the past oh you don't have one not right now we i have a cat and a dog both oh my gosh well you should have a lot to talk about then yeah but uh well no the place i live in is a little too small right now for uh for a pet i hate to hate to keep a dog or something like that and not have enough room for it to run around in so yeah but uh i guess you don't have that problem at least with the cat no i have i have a house that uh has a a fairly good sized yard and uh i also i'm here by at night by myself because my husband works at night and um-hum so i i wanted a dog for protection and we i can imagine and we got a Dalmatian that's a pretty big dog yeah and he that's a pretty dog though he's wonderful because uh he's really protective um-hum and uh that was probably our main reason for getting him but how's how's he like the cat or how's the cat like the dog i guess it oh he loves the cat the dog uh Sam our Dalmatian loves the cat but the cat just really doesn't care about the dog at all you know he'll slap at him and hiss at him and everything and the cat stays in all the time so uh-huh that's a uh you know barrier there but yeah i guess it's a good reason to to have a pet then as protection i guess is one thing hm yeah it is but uh i guess i they're a lot of company though yeah friendship they're an awful lot of company friendship yeah yeah oh Sam is very loving if if one of us are out in the yard you know he wants to jump and play and lick a typical puppy type atmosphere although he's um-hum almost two years old but oh gee um yeah the cat is a lot of companionship um-hum he just he's real old and he kind of lays around just wants you pet him and and that kind of thing doesn't doesn't get too excited about anything no not at all not at all he's not one of those cats that like to sit on top of the television is he no my mom has a cat though that does that um-hum and that's kind of weird we haven't figured that out yet yeah i've i've noticed how they get black cats it seems like they always wanna sit on top of the television set and let their tail only when when there's something you really want to see then they let their tail down in front of the TV set in front of the screen and uh yeah they they just seem to know i guess just intuition or something instinct in a way but uh it it sounds like you have pretty normal pets though i guess uh you know a lot of people i mean i guess i've never cared for birds or fish or um or gerbils or anything like that but dogs and cats are about the only thing i think of when i think of pets uh-huh yeah i've i've never had any the ones that you just mentioned i have had a rabbit um-hum it was pretty interesting and it was like a cat it stayed in the house all the time and it used a litter box um-hum yeah so it had free run of the house was it as was it as friendly as a cat or do you do you think you uh uh not not to strangers not strangers at all matter of fact it would run and hide but after it got to know you it was funny because it would jump up on the couch and sit right next to you you know and it kind of pants um-hum hm i didn't know a rabbit panted but they pant kind of like a dog neither did i huh and it's kind of funny because you can just sit there and pet them and my rabbit got real large i think he was thirteen pounds oh gee that is a big rabbit so he was really big that was kind of funny looking um-hum but uh was but he was a good guard was he yeah at he heard every little noise and you could tell when a car drove up or anything but but he's not much protection i would imagine oh no no no i don't think so not not not an attack rabbit or anything like that no nothing like that not real protective but uh well i i guess that's about to say about pets okay thanks bye-bye all right well very nice speaking to you bye-bye  i'll let you go first well i think i don't know how your schools work back there but we support our schools here with property taxes um-hum and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax so if you're renting a house or doing anything else you're not actually contributing to the education of your children and i think that's wrong i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system so as it turns out we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it yeah i uh i spent a couple uh years down in uh Plano Texas um-hum and uh i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death for the uh Plano uh school system yeah yeah and uh i've you know i know that Texas doesn't have a state tax and so all the things come out of the the property taxes no and i was uh really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying i was i was better off paying a state tax back in Maryland where than i was uh paying the uh property tax down there yeah yeah you would be uh what they did in Maryland to get around that is they uh they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services that the renters were getting including the uh educational services oh yeah and uh the tax was administered by um the uh rental company that actually was managing the apartments so when uh long long time ago when i used to live in apartments i would pay a rent uh payment every month and a tax payment every month gee and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was getting as a a resident of that particular county yeah um and uh that's the way it worked here in Maryland we have uh a certain portion of your your property taxes uh goes to education but also a portion of the state tax that you pay yeah goes back into the county that you live in ah to pay for the educational system oh well that's pretty good and so it it works out nice it it it makes it so that the uh whole county now i i know the concept of counties in Texas is quite a bit different than it is here in Maryland uh like Collin County uh would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of Baltimore County here in Maryland oh yeah i mean the the counties are much larger you know in the the whole state of Maryland i believe there's only like uh fifteen counties gee whiz and so uh you know each county has their own school system an and it works out real nice um the the the flip side to this is are we getting what we're paying for and i don't believe so um a lot of things have come to head um recently and i heard a report because of uh yeah uh the emphasis that the President was putting on education um-hum you know um him running as our education president and then finally a couple of years later getting around to doing something um yeah they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education in other words they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing yeah and then at the end of uh school year they would be tested and then they go into the fourth grade and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing so when they came up with these this nationwide system of public schools yeah uh they gave some figures out and since it's inception uh they've the price has gone up per student the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirty three percent yeah and so they're actually spending thirty three percent and that's real dollars you know that adjusting it back to to the days you know when it started uh probably you know seventy years ago yeah and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirty three percent improvement in education no huh-uh we've actually gone backwards well they say that Texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation that our high school graduates can't even match the national average yeah so you know our school system down here is no where near perfect but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it yeah well they they've been having some problems uh even here in uh like Baltimore City which is a a pretty good city good good sized city yeah uh they've been putting a lot of uh stress on it and of course speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to you know do everything they're supposed to do and of course they've uh been cutting the teachers salaries because they say we don't have the money to do it and oh yeah yep all the services are costing more money and and everything uh but the uh a lot of emphasis now is being put on you know when children used to be taught you know like uh uh each child is individual you know they're not all the same yeah yeah they need to take things at their own speed and some students do horrible until like eighth grade some do horrible you know until they get to like tenth grade and then all of a sudden everything clicks in you know and then there are some students that you know read well at five years old yeah um-hum and you know seem to excel and so that the you know one of the things i heard proposed on uh one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed some kids yeah i think it'd be a lot better yeah you know each child has to learn at his own rate they can't keep force feeding things to each other and or you know at the kids and and uh and on top of that they they make the child feel inferior um-hum because he can't do it because he's not as good as another kid his same age i mean it's like yeah you know that's ridiculous and it's not that he can't do it he just can't do it quite as fast or yeah and uh you know i have uh i i have five children total and i've got two out of the house already and i have i have two that are in uh eighth grade this year yeah all right and prior to their um when i when they were in elementary school they were identified identified as being slow yeah and so they put them into special programs and then we actually held them back in fourth grade and it wasn't until the last two years um last year my uh they're they're a set of twins um a boy and a girl last year the the uh boy twin started doing real well um-hum all right and it it it everything started to click in for him and he knew what he n eeded to do um and this year it it happened for uh for the daughter huh all right she just has been jumped on out there really doing grea t this year and she has the right attitude towards school and everything and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path i remember when i was in school i did horrible that's good yeah i did too up until ninth or tenth grade up until about yeah about the seventh eighth grade i i i started to to come around and realize an and basically i got interested in math and uh never really did well in English but you know once you got interested in something yeah and things started to click in place then after that you take off yeah and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course i had a electronics course i could take but we lived out in the country and we didn't have all that um-hum fancy stuff to worry about you know we had our auto shop out there and our agricultural shop and yeah you know we had just about every thing that we needed but they don't have it anymore there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore our our oldest boy goes to Lubbock High down here and they go to school four and half days a week so jeez that's pretty weird yeah it is um my children had a uh real culture shock um when we lived in Plano i guess i don't know if you've heard about the Plano school district but they're uh they really stress academics there no hum and uh God if your child is not an honor student well then you're something wrong with you as a parent and that that's kind of the way they are there gee yeah and uh when we moved back to Maryland um i moved to a uh a Baltimore County which is a northern county in Maryland um-hum and it's basically a rural county once you get above about the half way point yeah and we lived you know in the northern part of the county uh we went from a uh middle school in Texas that served fifty five square blocks to a uh middle school in Maryland that served fifty five square miles yeah and it was just a complete culture shock because i mean they they're riding on the bus in the morning with uh other kids that you know are a sleep because they got up at three o'clock and were doing chores and you know it's yeah i can imagine yeah yeah that would be quite a shock and they had uh agricultural they had an agricultural course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal um-hum oh like Four H then had to learn how to drive a tractor they actually had to go take a driving test on the tractor i mean they just couldn't believe this and it was great they loved it all right all right i mean they really enjoyed the courses um and it you know it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain a drain yeah just something you do everyday yeah and it was you know it was like kind of like the way we feel about going to work yeah yeah just something i have to do everyday but uh up here they seem to have made it uh a lot of fun for them and they they seem to really enjoy it that's good our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice  okay uh let me see we were supposed to talk about are consumer goods better or worse and have you had to take anything back recently have you let's see yeah i'm always returning things but i have three kids and um a lot of times it's just because it doesn't fit the way that i thought it was going to well that's really clothes isn't it consumer goods oh okay yeah trying to think no i haven't returned anything lately i haven't either i think things must be getting better well i haven't bought that much really oh my goodness that could explain it no it's true i think if you're talking about major appliances like stereos and refrigerators and washing machines i mean we've had a lot all ours for quite a while and yeah of course they're probably all Japanese too i'm sorry it's hard to tell anymore who owns what by the names isn't it i know it i know it and i really would like to buy American but i don't think it's possible i think it except for maybe in clothes but i think all the electronics are yeah yeah you know basically they're assembled in Japan i look for that tag i look for that because i well uh yesterday i bought a curling iron for my daughter and there was two that were the same price and one had a made in America i do too oh really you know tag so i just picked it up i said i'll buy that one yeah i'm trying to be more conscientious about that yeah that's how come i like Wal-Mart you know they try and buy usually all yeah yeah yeah that's where i bought it as a matter of fact yeah that's why i prefer if i'm going to shop at a discount place that's where i like to shop is because of that because i realistically we ought to keep stuff at home and um um-hum um-hum um-hum but no i don't think i have returned anything in a in a long time uh yeah yeah but you know i think our expectations expectations are a lot lower than they used to be yeah i do too you you know just in general when you buy something you never i mean i don't i never expect anything to i'm amazed when things last like my refrigerator here ten years you know i'm amazed and and right but it yeah yeah i'm always waiting for something to go on it but and if something does don't you always try to fix it before you ever bring it in because you know you're never going to see it again me too yeah right but now days uh getting it fixed is almost as much as going out and buying a new one it's worse the service is worse it really is than buying new because um people just don't know how to fix things now and yeah uh-huh it really i know it they don't keep up with the new technology you know and right and cars that's really bad too oh that's the worse we have uh mini van and the door the sliding door on it has never worked right and we've had it back twice to have parts replaced and stuff and they just can't uh-huh have you really you know i don't i i don't i think there was just something wrong with the door originally and then i don't think the service people have the foggiest idea of how to fix it i know it and you know i you think you ought to take it back to the dealer because they know them but gosh they're so high they just rip you off oh they're terrible oh i i try to avoid the dealer unless you know i think they that's the worst service i've ever gotten anywhere is in a dealer i do too i absolutely have to have me too and if they'd only realize that that's what what gets me back to i have quit Ford and Chevrolet both because the dealers were so lousy they gave me lousy service they and uh so i've right yeah yep it wasn't the car well it was the car but i think the car could have been taken care of if a dealer had backed it up but they didn't um-hum right but you know we're not from this part of the country and it i've never had uh we're from up north in New England and boy it is uh real different up there with the service is it really really different when you make an appointment for a certain time during the day so you don't have to always drop it off first thing in the morning and you drop it off and sometimes they run late but never they never keep it oh really i mean i can't say never i just say in my experience they'll say well you know they'll get it if they're done if they're not going to get it done they will at least tell you down here they just lie to you yeah i've had my car my car has been in the shop since a week a week ago Saturday i put it in for a new vinyl top and some hail damage and found out i bummed a ride uh uh-huh uh to work all week well you know i still had to go to the grocery store and to the bank and you i just have to have a car so i finally ended up renting a car and i i you know yep yeah right that's ridiculous that you have to do that i'm now renting a car i and it may be ready next Tuesday of Wednesday see but i just can't understand that i mean i i because they haven't gotten to it yet probably i know it they uh you they don't people don't want to work anymore i i'd what right i just can't see that i tried to get uh when i moved i moved up here from Florida and i wanted to get a uh my um-hum patio covered because down there we everybody had screened in porches and they're so pretty and they're so reasonable and everything and um-hum yeah yeah gosh i can't believe the prices they all quoted me on i said my God no wonder you guys are suffering up here the the prices you're charging for and i finally ended up getting a really yep a steel uh um-hum uh top but it wasn't uh uh i wanted an aluminum uh and i wanted it insulated from the heat but this is just steel and then he charged me um-hum um oh gosh i think eight or nine hundred dollars in Orlando i got the whole thing done screened in the carpeting they insulated the the gutters and everything for fifteen hundred dollars um-hum no kidding oh my goodness gosh now up here i couldn't even begin to i couldn't begin to afford a room like that up here so i just that's something yeah yeah i'll tell you another thing about um about um appliances too um i'm uh more apt to try and get them fixed now than buy a new one just simply to keep from throwing things away yeah you know that kind of isn't back in with the ecology effort and uh and the and the yeah and boy i bet i have six curling irons up there that have burned up you know that i won't throw away i won't get them fixed either though you know oh i yeah i know those i mean those things are so cheap but i mean like we have a vacuum that i got when i got married like thirteen years ago and it it was in real bad shape about five years ago and i've had it overhauled for eight eighty dollars i guess and i could have bought a new one for ninety five but it still works um-hum yeah but um-hum um-hum well i have a Kirby's an old Kirby i've had for about um ten fifteen years and i i'm like you i've spent eighty six dollars on it last year i keep having it you just redone and yeah yep yeah i think that's better though you know to do i do too and it's just as good a vacuum cleaner as right because those things cost well well you know what the price of new Kirby vacuum cleaners are now no huh-uh just the basic without an any of the attachments or anything i think is sixteen hundred dollars i said my gosh it has to come out and clean my house by itself and serve me dinner before i'd pay sixteen hundred dollars and that's without the uh you know i uh-huh oh no but yeah i wouldn't spend that much everything on it i couldn't believe it no that's wild but boy but they're good and vacuums not that good jeez no i just i had a guy come out and give me uh a demonstration on a new one and i um-hum golly of course he made me look like now i keep a real clean house but by the time he got through with me with that new vacuum cleaner made me look like a you know filthy mess you know he was sucking dead uh um-hum oh no hey listen for sixteen hundred dollars you just save that and put it in the bank you'd get new carpet in a couple of years i know yeah just throw your carpet away well he was sucking uh you know dead skin off of through the mattress you know went from the comforter through the sheet oh you don't and and he was showing me all this dead skin that you shed during the night and i said oh my God horrible i know it you don't want to oh yuck that's gross i don't even want to i don't want to know about that uh i don't either if i'm shedding then i don't want to know about it as long as i don't can't see i well i let a guy talk me into uh a water softener when i first moved out here a twenty six hundred dollars we i just panicked after well he kind of scared me he just was really uh coming on strong and he just almost threatening me and he stayed until about ten o'clock at night and course uh-huh yeah yeah yeah you couldn't get rid of him no and i'm not married and i think he and i let let it out that i wasn't and he was a big old guy and i thought oh God that was stupid i should have told him i had a husband but i didn't anyway the next day i had this guy that works for me call and tell him that i was cancel because you had that three day cooling down period here um-hum yeah uh-huh and so i canceled out of it good oh good i know that is scary i just don't i won't talk to people i mean i just tell them i am not interested i don't want anything you're selling go away oh and it yeah i don't care if i'm rude i just that's what i do anymore i just i'm not interested and if they call me on the phone i'm not interested just clunk up yep yeah you know i just read about here's another thing that you can buy it just read about it in the paper today you can get this attachment for your answering machine uh-huh and what it is is it's like a little coder box and you tell all the people that you want to talk to like your family and your friends and stuff a three digit code oh okay and anybody who doesn't have it has to leave an answering answer on a message on the answering machine so if you get somebody trying to sell you something they can leave their little message but if it's your sister or somebody they can punch in their code oh yeah wow yeah course it costs a hundred dollars this year two years from now it'll be fifty i think i'll wait oh naturally naturally yeah yeah right it probably i'll wait and it'll come down to twelve dollars you know about five years well that's good right right yeah that might be come in handy if things keep getting as bad as they do and stuff yeah i always hated answering machines until i got mine i do i i still don't like them i don't like them very much i think yeah i don't either i have it but i don't like it it was given to me and i feel like i have to use and it's come in handy i've had some messages i like but i almost refuse to leave messages and my daughter i said well i called you and she said well i didn't get a message i said i didn't leave one yep yeah yeah i know i don't like to leave them that much that's the way of answering machines i thought i don't i feel dumb talking to a machine for some reason i know well of course but i i know i the thing is though when you have an answering machine then you have to call everybody back if you don't have one then they have to call you i just i just was out this afternoon and i came in and i listened to answering machine and i had a friend that called that's right then you know that you and not five minutes went by and she called again and she said well didn't you get my message on the machine or do you just not want to talk to me see i know yeah you're right you almost and i was like well i just sat down you know i know i just got in or i have had i've told them i said well no i didn't get it i guess the machine wasn't working or something like that yeah yeah i know but other than that you know i'm lying and i know it yeah they don't believe you i haven't had to take any of those back um no i i don't know whether um i think that's about the last time well that was a gift to me so i guess that's yeah i think we just we haven't bought that much stuff lately but and i think we all probably all have all the toys now yep there aren't any toys out there that we don't need so that's why we haven't bought anything as soon as something new comes out well probably i i guess everybody i know has got right right that's right you know VCR's and answering machines and portable phones and i don't have a car phone but i don't think i hate that i i get mad when i drive up and somebody's talking on the phone i think they're not driving safely did you know in England that's against the law to drive and talk on telephone yeah yeah oh please my goodness yep wow and i think it ought to be he sounds  hello okay yeah okay um do you work at TI no i don't do you yeah oh okay what company are you are you working at all yeah i work for NCNB oh okay and let's see the question was what benefits you consider most important i think uh definitely medical and dental insurance yeah uh-huh um life insurance long-term disability uh vacation what vacation oh yeah don't ever think of those as a benefit but they sure are yeah and um i think what i don't like some of the policies that our company has that i don't like i don't like their sick leave policy their short-term disability policy and i would like to see them do something about um child care yeah what is their sick leave policy oh it's only like i don't know like six days a year which is way below the national average is it paid yeah uh do you get penalized for taking it off no the reason why i said is um TI uh the hourly employees um they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but if they miss more than say ten point five hours in a three month period they get penalized for it so really they don't ever huh um-hum that's not even two days that's not even two days and what if you get the flu and you're sick for a week or two huh-uh the problem is with that is that we work eleven or we work twelve hour days so no one could even take off a day for pay you know PTO um because they get penalized for it oh no yeah and they lose their certification pay which is like fifty five cents an hour for three whole months so it's really not a very good benefit wow no that's in fact i wouldn't call that much of a benefit at all i think you know people get sick and if you get sick usually you're sick for more than a day and then you know if your children get sick yeah uh you know parents have to take time off for that and um yeah that's the biggest thing and people come to work sick but when their kids get sick it's like well i can't afford to take off but i have to yeah and i think you know it varies from manager to manager some managers keep track of it and some managers don't and it's really unfair you know uh-huh that's true it is it's not really uh consistent but i think you know at NCNB in any any work place being a single parent i think that child care is my greatest expense and um you know it's it's getting to the point where you just can't afford it anymore yeah i really wish that somebody in big companies or any company would take a hint from like that movie Nine to Five did you see that where they had the child care right there on the um-hum right there yes that was so good and that would help the morale of parents i think so much yes very much very much because i hate to see that i mean probably ninety percent of the people that work for me are single parents and they have to you know use child care at least for a couple hours a days um-hum so i don't know i i really think a big company needs to take responsibility for that and i think they should even do something for when children are sick you know provide facilities for sick children yeah although i know that's not very comfortable for the children when they're sick they probably just would rather stay home but um you know my options are you know to either call in sick to take to take him to one of those places that takes care of sick children um you know and that's about it you know a lot of times i don't have the option of staying home without you know i just can't you know there's something going on that day or you know that i have to be there for um-hum yeah and i know a lot of um what i do like though is i see a lot of men taking off and they take turns with their wives yeah that's good you know staying home with the kids but that's still you know kids are sick a lot i know it's real i don't have kids yet but it's tough and uh um what kind of uh how many vacation days do you get a year well i get three weeks that's great for how many years you been have you worked there yeah i got that when i started because i was because i'm an officer of the company oh wow that's great so it depends on if you're an if you're not an officer it depends on how long you've been there i think you get like a week your first year and then two weeks and then you have to be there like five years to get three weeks or four years um-hum and then officers just start out at three weeks and then they go up to four weeks huh depending on i'm real happy with the vacation i guess you know you could take vacation days if you had to stay home but yeah TI isn't doing very well so like i'm i'm negative vacation because i've only worked there three years and i i get five days every six months well um-hum um-hum every about two three months we shut down for a week because you know there's no demand for our product so oh yeah i've heard of companies that do that yeah and so we've shut down six weeks a year whereas we used to only shut down two ooh and so it's kind of hurt yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that yeah and luckily my boss has maybe you know allowed me to work it off but a lot of people you know go in the hole and uh take you know weeks without pay and it's tough oh can you collect unemployment um i don't ever but the people that work for me do yeah do they i mainly the reason because i'm salary so i don't ever lose pay i mean i just go in debt for vacation so yeah yeah well that's yeah that's not not very good are you satisfied with your insurance um yeah mainly because i haven't had really had to use it much i mean does your company pay for it or do you pay for it yeah i have to pay for my husband which is kind of expensive for him i mean it's like do you have flexible benefits where you can get sort of like pick and choose sort sort of yeah um the reason why i don't know much is because i don't real uh i haven't really had to use like my medical i know they increased the deductible last year which kind of hurt um-hum and i don't know and after that they pay like eighty percent and the dentals the dental covers quite a bit but like i said i've never really been sick or anything so i've never had to use it well i think our our insurance we have to pay for part of it and the company pays for part of it but it's expensive but i don't think it's out of line with what other company you know with what other companies do it's just that in general it's it's expensive um and you know i don't i don't like it do you have uh um four O one K is that like match savings yeah yeah it's fifty percent matched well that's good how some companies i know are a hundred percent matched yeah like Harris Semiconductors in Florida really where are where for a new job huh ours will only match twenty five yeah for up to ten percent of your salary really ours is only up to four percent though oh okay well then i guess that's makes a difference yeah because i mean i only put in like a real small amount because it's four percent you know after after after that you put it in and you get like interest interest i mean i've saved quite a bit it's helped me a lot but yeah well that's good you have to roll it over to an IRA if you ever quit yeah but you know that's still a good deal yeah i'm glad that we that we have that um the company that i worked for before NCNB was just they were just starting it and uh i think that's i think that's great uh yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think well yeah because retirement plans now are so bad i don't know about your company but our company tries to keep base salaries low and they compensate employees more with bonuses really and incentive pay rather than raises because it cuts down on their expenses for the pension plan because your pension's going to be based on what your salary was not what your salary plus bonuses where and your your bonuses cut ultimately end up being fifty percent of your salary ooh wow so that's kind of a rip yeah but more and more companies are going to that now huh TI didn't even give raises this year so at all no they gave uh a few bonuses but for the most part no nobody in TI got raises really gosh that's pretty bad especially with you know inflation and i i've noticed that the cost of living i've lived in Dallas now for three years and the cost of living has just gone up incredibly in that three years that i've been here yeah yeah really yeah your housing housing mostly i guess is where i notice it but you know in in you know kids kid's get more expensive as they um
