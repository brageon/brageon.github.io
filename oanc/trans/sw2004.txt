 child care seems to be uh a uh a topic that varies i guess with where you are geographically if you're in an area where you got a lot to select from then i guess there are a lot of criterias to choose from but if you're in an area where there's two or three then uh you get what you can take yeah and i guess it'd depend on the the age of the child the needs of the child how long the child has to be there if it's a five day a week deal i would certainly look a lot harder than if it was just a couple of days a month oh yeah and uh we're in a situation where it's just one maybe two days a month uh at best so we're well that's lucky in only a couple of hours usually what we use them for now is to transport between school and and uh the day care center and have them wait there just long enough for me to get off work and go pick them up yeah that's good so it's nice to uh to just have them there for the limited time frame but the uh the drawback is the pay structures there's so many different situations that these day care centers have to get into they have a lot of the ones have just decided that they will simplify their work load by saying if you get on the bus to ride between school and day care you'll pay ten dollars regardless of whether you road one way or both ways and regardless of whether you stayed there just half an hour or three hours um-hum oh they just averaged it all out but most kids stay until about six so it will be about ten dollars which will cover the ride and cover the hours you stay wow yeah and i've got uh one kid getting out at two forty five and one getting out at three thirty so the one gets picked up at two forty five gets there by about three um-hum and i'm there a little before four o'clock to pick them up so he doesn't stay there even an hour and the other child is not even there when i get there and doesn't get there until about four it's about thirty minutes to do a ten minute ride in there little bus and yeah so the you know just for the doesn't really work out for us too economical to pay twenty dollars for a one way bus ride for these two kids but some days we have to do it some days it just works out to where i don't get into work early enough to get off yeah i can see that early enough to get them but uh fortunately the other end of the deal is some days my wife uh yeah being a dental hygienist works by appointments so she if she has a day scheduled where she has to get the kids into the day care to of them take them to school and she has uh a yeah right an appointment say at eight thirty and she has to be all the way across town at her office at eight thirty then she needs to have them ride the bus one way and i'll get off in time to hopefully pick both of them up and not have the day care center in the other direction but uh just a myriad of of possibilities that these people have to serve so they have a myriad of pay structures but uh it it can get expensive most of them run uh yeah four some as many as five dollars an hour per child for uh what we call drop in care which is the situation we're in we're not a regular so the days we do use them we pay through the nose and uh yeah oh i bet and make their kids stay there we found on in the area that that is letting us pay as little as two fifty an hour that's still five dollars an hour for two of our kids and it it's uh fun we try to keep it to a minimum yeah i bet yeah i you'd have to yeah it's uh i when when i uh i i i was i was a commercial artist for almost six years before um we started our family and i looked into uh into child care and and we were living in we were living in Dallas my husband was working at the North building at the time and we just didn't like anything we saw we really i didn't want to leave an infant um-hum with the child care that was in it the immediate area right that we were we were located in so we uh we tightened some belt um-hum belt loops and uh i just i decided to stay home with with her and we're we're expecting our second child any day now in fact i'm past due well so so i just so we've been real pleased that our that that i that i haven't to to use the we haven't had to use day care but because what we found we just didn't like at all yeah well even if you work out the economics if you get over all the other hurdles of the ratio of of workers to uh kids and uh the uh infant worker uh worker areas how well that's closed off or how not well that's closed off from the other noise yeah uh once you get over all the other hurdles just the economics of it uh it's not as much of an impact to stay home as it were if you figure in what it would cost you to go back to work and you know the right oh right that's exactly what it was with us it was just it was uh we all we had to do was we pay off a vehicle early and then i would have just been paying for for that and and child care was my uh salary and it wasn't worth it yep that that's it so it was of course you couldn't have known two to three years ago when you were making this decision what the taxes were going to do now the child care what you do pay doesn't not even worth a hill of beans on your tax return can't deduct it so what's it good for no it's not so it's it's gotten it's changed a little bit over the years but uh yeah uh it is so expensive down here for a child care because we're originally from Missouri Missouri and most and of our family's still there and uh my husband's sisters have their kids in child care and it's a lot less expensive then it is down here um-hum right it's um it's it's amazingly less expensive than it is well what the market can bear and yeah oh it oh yeah and boy there are kids in this this little section of Plano that we're in we're surrounded less than a mile we have six different centers to our at our disposal so wow we can go north to two of them or south to three of them or just over west a little bit further and there's two more over there there's just all around us but and we've been to everyone of them over the time well that's lucky but the kids uh the kids just well we used to use them a little more than we do now that they're in school and the kids just kind of get tired of them that's lucky uh-huh they get tired of the uh you know what's available to play on and uh and what's outside and and plus they they tend to just shift around in in who runs them for a while and the uh pay structure changes and really so we've just moved with wherever's it happens to be cheapest and they happen to want to survive at and they want to live at this one for a while yeah and uh we found it cheaper even during the summer for me to uh take off for half a day since we work a four and a half day work week and come home on these Thursdays that she goes to work at uh eleven and get's off at seven thirty at night uh-huh and that she does that on Thursdays and then occasional Saturday's and i can take off on those Thursday's and be home in time to for her to go off to work and it's cheaper for me to do that and take my vacation even if i uh um-hum take all thirteen weeks of summer that's less than uh right at a weeks full full uh full week's worth of vacation and i have you know three weeks a year i been long enough to do that wow yeah now i always end up in a must take situation anyway so yeah we decided to eat it up that way and still take a week off and still have a few days to for whatever week long weekends or the like and i think we're going to do that again this summer like we did last summer because we paid close to seven or eight hundred dollars just to have someone come into the home at a couple a dollars an hour to take care of them on those Thursdays throughout the summer so yeah it it's hard to to find the prices i guess that does seem to be one of the major driving factors i know oh it is it it it plus plus um when we were in in the section of uh North Dallas over by Addison there's just not hardly any day care over there at all it's surprising um yeah because of the when i was searching for it the best the best place i could find in the was down in Farmers Branch and i worked in Carrollton it just and i was i was going to have to drive and drive and drive and and it was just it was just really oh boy there were just so many strikes against it but uh like up here in McKinney there's there's a few places there's like i think there's i've seen two up here um and there's just really not very much well i guess they haven't had the i don't know what the incentive would be but um i guess with all the ones around the Plano area and figuring that most of them drive south for their jobs maybe they maybe they've done it that way and going with that logic that's true oh yeah a lot of people drive into Dallas from here a lots of them yeah it must be on what they're counting on so yeah yeah i i i assume so hum well uh speaking of kids i've got one hollering at me so i better head on we'll okay okay well nice talking to you bye bye cross paths later um bye  okay we're energized um painting interesting uh the guy called me when she called me the computer called me i thought that they were reading my mind i'm in the middle of um going out for bids to have my house painted okay oh uh painting is not hard to do uh as long as it's not in not to the point of where it's uh needs to be scraped and bleeding and peeling no right and our house is not but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap and it's just a hassle to go do it so i'm looking for the easy way out and uh yeah i know did is it easy to find painters uh painters to do this for you it's easier to find painters but you have to be you have to be aware of what of how messy they can get and are they gonna put on a good a good two coats and are they gonna caulk exterior right are you talking about outside or inside exterior yeah yeah uh interior's not so bad it's because it's more fun it's more convenient but you get outside where you have high peaks and those kind of things it can be a real issue well yeah well when we've painted um right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles um-hum on the back and there's some sort of stone or something in the front so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted um but it it the problem is that it hits the sun hits it so preparing it is a real problem you've got to prepare it well or else it'll flake um-hum um-hum here the um some of the home builders are they they don't put brick on the side of your houses to save money so they put up a lot uh little quarter inch Masonite basically and they're painted kind of like a spun of some sort and so it's real cheap and uh uh i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i've as low as five hundred and forty dollars so it's just a matter of it's wow that's quite a range oh yeah one guy brags about his his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap and i'm not so much worried about that as what yeah i don't want it all over the brick and windows and and the yeah which might be a bigger problem than it would be uh yeah absolutely oh sure so y'all you haven't had any any jobs painted in your house or recently then no we have uh done a little painting ourselves um we painted a bedroom uh well within the last couple of months um and we have we have some more that need to be done but the just fun um-hum the problem that we we've owned this house almost five years now and um when we bought it the um it had been vacant for a while because the family had retired to Arizona but the daughter was a real estate agent and she was selling it and it'd been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house so she told us that the house had been uh professionally painted recently and it looked pretty good you know the interior walls all basically white but they obviously had been done without to much uh wear afterward the only problem was when we started having the movers move the uh furniture in we identified the various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood uh the door frames when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it um-hum uh that's not very big long strips so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly and some of that still has to be redone oh man just painted over varnished wood oh my yeah well no actually it had been uh it would had been a repaint job hm but they had not um either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they would because it was woodwork so it looked as if it had been painted um-hum correctly with you know uh an enamel or something but um it had not either that or it had had not been prepared underneath and it was greasy or something sure it comes off in strips i mean not even little bit so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time we know what a job it's gonna be because you almost have to strip the whole thing in order do it again oh no hm i wish you good luck okay thank you bye thank you very much bye-bye  so how do you feel about our policy in Latin America oh i'm all in favor of it yeah No i uh i think we've been doing a pretty good job you know not uh not taking advantage of our you know of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us you know uh i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been i don't think we've been doing too bad yeah well do you think that's do you think that's right do you think we should direct the government um well i think that uh as a whole that the being that the drug problem the drug industry can uh bring so much money to a country i think that if it wasn't for the United States Government matching that the government the drug uh cartels or whatever would control most the Central and Latin America yeah just that uh money is power and uh yeah well i have a friend that's uh his descendants his descendants are from um uh Nicaragua and uh very i mean it's like his mother his mother came over and uh uh-huh he you know i just as far as feelings uh for people that their family came from there and how they feel about you know our intervention and their governments and stuff like that and he he was all for it because it's just like you say uh there's so many people there that that uh-huh that get the kind of control that's bad you know and that their governments can become so corrupt and it's like well uh you know i use to feel like uh-huh well they they should work their way they you know they should should be able to work their self out of it or you know why why why intervene in another country's you know problems and things like that why why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that but i think just a lot of times if we don't then then it will then that influence will affect our country too for one and for two you know that it does help i mean you know i think the people in those countries do want our help the people that are you know under conditions that are you know not favorable to this their rights right exactly yeah so but uh but um i wish we didn't have to i mean i i'd rather even if a country chooses a government that's not you know exactly the kind of government that we have you know or or is in complete opposition to it at least it's their choice as as long as long it's one that's that that makes sense so to speak you know this is a government that stays in power that can stay in power but it seems like most of them don't yeah you know well sometimes that's that's America doing that too you know we oh yeah we fall out of uh agreements with certain leaders and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader you know it's uh so you think like CIA influence and our money over there that and uh that and yeah America starts talking then about removing bases and and whatnot and stuff like that and people yeah or or government aids and stuff right yeah i think that has a lot of things to did with uh um well then how can you how can you say as far as like in um Europe as far as the the toppling of those kinds of governments you know like yeah that was uh i'm i'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not because i mean on one hand you have you know that the you know the Soviet Government of course mistreating a lot of the uh Slovak countries and then on the other hand you have well they they were feeding us you know so uh yeah i don't know really what's going to happen but we don't we're not intervening in that or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing oh yeah i think we're getting quite a put it this way i think no i think the people are revolting themselves and we're yeah uh allowing it to happen see i i agree with that yeah yeah i i agree that that the communication uh that now that communication has become so much more widespread and you know so worldwide that people are realizing hey we don't have it so good and let's stand up right for you know uh well that this is ridiculous we're living with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is that uh i think people are just saying no way we don't want any more of this uh-huh yeah i think uh Central America has always been one of those places where people are more passive you know where it's always the minority that are yeah are trying to make the country better yeah well i mean i don't mean to well i guess i do in a way sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that i think that that uh because of those countries countries a lot you know where such Catholic influence and i think the Catholic religion itself was was such a dominant factor as far as keeping the people down so to speak i thought it was the other way around they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it it's been sort of like you know but but see there but i don't agree with that because the Catholic religion as far as through the ages has been the rule so to speak you know they are the ones that set the rules set a lot of the rules and they are the ones that do keep the people down i mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're yet they're expected to bow down to it i think that keeps people in a sort of line you know i don't quite understand that do they even understand what's being said well when when it use to be Latin i'm just saying saying that oh yeah the old church uh the old church yeah yeah which it's not that way now but i think that there is just that i think that it's just Latin countries are slower in coming around well they actually understood it is in America where it was hard Latin you know well Latin is very very very close to Spanish um they still didn't understand it though i don't think yeah because i i descend from that and i you know i don't can't i don't understand Latin uh and i'm of Spanish descent so yeah um i i just think that has something to do with why Latinos are tend to be you know the meek the more meek you know they tend to be more not stand up for their rights as much they're not really sure of what they are i don't think uh i never really thought of in that way well i mean how can you contrast the the Europeans and their vocalism on their rights to to say the people in Latin America i mean why are they why are they not as vocal or why do they not you know stand up so to speak for their rights i don't know could be the t he economic still You know the there's the poverty level is certainly uh you know much worse in the Latin American countries i mean you can say that about Africa too i think it has something to do with the poverty level because Africa is certainly not a Catholic uh country and yet um-hum and yet you know they have the same problem where you know where kings and such um i don't agree with that i don't agree because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in in uh Africa i think the y've made a lot more changes hey they've their very vocal well in South Africa yeah well in South Africa yeah In South Africa i think they are but yet you know Idi Amin was you know in power for so long well so what's the difference yeah so what makes the difference between say South America and the rest of i mean South Africa and it is rest of Africa uh racial i think or like you say maybe communication of knowing that hey up in other English colonies or previous English colonies everything is equal and yet down there it's not you know yeah i think communication does have a lot to do with it you know in education maybe i don't know about education because the black community is still not very educated down there yeah so i think it is communication it's just oopsy i think it maybe has to do with a lot uh a lot to do with education because you look at the uh European countries i think they are they do tend to be more educated much more educated than uh-huh than Africa or the Latin American countries yeah that's true You know that i don't know whether uh actually i i've always wondered whether how the education system works in the Russian countries the Republics you know um-hum well i know that Russia they're they're comparably more educated better educated than we are in our country really that's good in a way You know uh something we compete with yeah uh and i've been sort of disappointed how that they they say literacy rate has gone down you know that's sort of upsetting to think that we're richer and yet everybody is intellectually poorer yeah uh in our country in our country yeah yeah that is really upsetting and and considering it's free you know i mean good education is really still free yeah well that's just it though good education uh-huh is it good education it may be free but is it good education and that's just it are we willing to pay for it you know yeah uh-huh i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all but are so are they willing to pay for you know uh quality education you know uh-huh so you know and yet they yet people get very frightened when they see the Japanese moving in and the Russians moving in certain areas of technology you know that we use to dominate and it's like well you know they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do so you're going to have to expect it so what you are you willing are you willing to compromise a little and and pay pay some take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education so i don't know but i i uh  hi Wanet how are you ah doing fine where you from i'm from New England Massachusetts okay i'm from Berkeley California wow this is quite a quite a long distance ah certainly is do you have any pets no used to used to but none none right now how come uh you don't have any now you get tired of them well i i live in an apartment building and and uh and and it it's just just not feasible you know i'd love to have a dog you know yeah i've got a little doggy uh that i've had quite uh quite a long time in fact she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve ah and uh is she i beg your pardon what is she she's uh uh uh a poodle of a toy poodle a toy poodle and she's ah ah my got my mom a teacup poodle not too long ago this is a little bigger than a teacup yeah and uh it's funny how uh how i i uh i got acquired this animal uh when i was uh married my uh ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed uh the woman needed someone to babysit and uh this is what she had told the kids and she even told me that and after the two week period was up uh she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it well after you had an animal for a couple of weeks it's uh you become attached you become attached to it oh for sure oh yeah so i've had this dog now for for sixteen years and she's been a lot of company uh she's uh however getting a little old and things are starting to fail um i i live alone now and she stays in the house all day while i go to work and uh she's been holding herself pretty well the uh up until uh you know recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is and uh i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home but she's she's usually pretty good yes well my my mother has one it's uh it's uh teacup and uh it's made such a difference for her but you know just i i i you know the way my mom's presence countenance it it's just just for having a puppy but you know having this dog she's had it for i guess three years now uh-huh oh possibly four but uh it was it it's it's really made such a difference from her i really would like to i'm a disabled person so i'm unable to to really take care of a pet and if if that uh-huh weren't so i would certainly certainly have one i just i just it frustrates me sometime not being able to have a dog um well you might wanna get yourself uh an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat yeah oh yeah well yeah uh i i i typically am not a cat person have a friend that uh has on occasion um brought her cat over for me to keep for you know time to time and and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen and uh uh it would sleep on my chest you know it's just it is just a great cat but yeah well my my personal preference is is a dog uh i don't know that uh that i'd ever want a cat oh i like cats i just wouldn't wanna own one uh they're not uh they're they're affectionate but they yeah i don't know i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog yeah well you don't own cats yeah you they they own you yeah right or or you know grant you with their presence you know yeah right that your supposed to appreciate them well my my dog when i came home uh when i come home in evenings she my dog greets me at the door i don't know that a cat would do that uh yeah i used to have a that that could read me better than any human being in my life yeah i could just walk in the door and she knew whether to to to quietly come up to me or to just run and and knock me over i mean she really could pick up on my mood the way i walked in the door it was uncanny yeah yeah hm i i think um you know we're able to read each other pretty well because uh she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too so i know like when she has an accident i know she's not doing it on purpose yeah when she when she was younger she used to do that to get even with me yeah uh and and you know some people might not believe that but uh but i do oh hey sure oh absolutely like if i if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours uh because i was going out she would uh break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to uh to to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did yeah really yes well i had that that cat that i mentioned i'll be one morning and you know the first thing you do is you get up and you you you you you you feed this cat something something and and you make sure that it can get to its litterbox well uh-huh some reason during the night the the door was not quite wide enough for it to get through and uh the next morning uh when my roommate got up and and uh did not feed it right away it decided that it was going to protest and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket for me looking looking at me eye to eye all the time while it was doing it all right have i got your attention now oh yes animals have a way of talking well it did i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day i i don't know that i'd uh that i'd trade my dog in for the world uh it was about two years ago she got sick on me and i took her to the uh to the vet's because she wasn't eating and and uh she wasn't able to jump she you know lost all her activity and uh she stayed there for one day and the doctor called me up and said uh she had a low white cell count and that uh she wasn't she was dying and uh suggested that i take her to a working hospital dog hospital animal hospital so i took his suggestion and i uh took the the dog to a hospital a dog hospital and they said that they'd keep her there for three days well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care i mean it cost me over five hundred dollars ouch plus the the uh the vet sent me a bill for what he did and uh and then she recouped she was okay for a couple of years and then she got sick on me again and i brought her to a different vet this time and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything and uh he gave me the medication the same medication that i gave her the last time and she was okay and she's been okay ever since it's been about two years now uh well that's great it really is i i'm glad you she was able to pull out of it uh and so cheaply the second time yeah well the see the problem is if if the if someone wouldn't have came up to me and said it's gonna cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive what do you wanna do i probably would've had second thoughts but what they well what they do is is they say well it's gonna cost yeah of course you would you know twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this and and you know and it creeps up on you you don't know that you know you really you you don't know what it's gonna cost until it's all over i uh to give you an example my mom uh had an elderly cat who uh who evidently evidently got old uh and uh the cat got sick so she took the cat to the vet and she had the cat there for two days and then the cat died so the doctor had called her up and said uh your cat died and you owe me this bill and oh by the way do you want me to to bury the cat so it cost her three hundred dollars um and she didn't get the cat back so you know they had to pay for all the the medical uh bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses and uh you know she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good so that that was a kind of a surprise at least at really jeez yeah you kind of wonder what really happened yeah well even the you know they they claimed they did the best that they could and then the cat uh died so now i'm looking for another cat for them um i i've i've got a little kitten uh that's still uh oh it just being born right now so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over to uh to my folks my goodness well that that that that will make their day yeah it i think it will because they're both in their in their seventies and uh the cat uh although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes turned out it turns out to be a a pleasant experience for them uh i think that they enjoy that only work initially yeah for cats anyway you know well listen it's been a pleasure talking to you yep well same here and you take care okay bye now yeah maybe maybe we'll talk again sometime okay what is that sound that's my buzzer at the door oh okay i'll let you go okay thank you right  okay okay well um do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked you know and so they figure why go out and vote you know they're going to do what they want to do they're corrupt anyway well and i think one of the good ways of solving that is to like everybody likes to come to a party so have a voting party and uh you know like in communities and have the issues there and then everybody go vote together and then maybe come back over and have brunch or something i mean that's the only thing that i can figure out because i've heard so many people say well i'm not going on voting on that one you know i i'm going to go fishing today or it won't make any difference if if i don't vote and i think it does we vote every time well it uh there's no question it does make a difference uh so far as having a party and then all voting uh when you have different precincts you would have to have a party in every precinct right because people have to vote in different area and uh not everyone votes at the same place uh i personally think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools to children from the little ones on up with the idea of the the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference but right and maybe maybe let them have some mock i mean uh you know elections and stuff and vote for different people in their classes and start really young that's a real good idea absolutely absolutely and and they are doing that in a number of schools however probably not enough of them uh country wide but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people uh to get across the idea of voting uh just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally uh realize the harmfulness of drugs right and uh hopefully to uh now with the many programs throughout the country on how to resist taking drugs how to say no to it and what have you that uh perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it but uh i know i i spent thirty four years in education here in the Dayton area and in nineteen fifty one the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana giving away their heroin and what have you to get them started um and now that was in fifty one that's forty years ago that it was already a problem so it's now uh God to the forefront and people are finally taking some action against it and to think we've we've neglected the value of voting right and uh and what it really means to vote and we also don't make the uh the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them yeah well i don't know how it is up there but down here Louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all i mean i'm sure you heard about some of ours and um people are just i mean it's like they're turned off on voting um-hum sure right and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like um-hum maybe they could give something like uh the top neighborhood if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that you know i mean it doesn't have to be it could be like a a sign that they would put down at the end of your block uh-huh you know or anything like that but it it's really bad here i mean to me it is it seems like people just don't care anymore they say huh well it don't make any difference you know one crook is as good as the other one and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say yeah right and um i know my husband now we go vote every time i don't care how small the ballot is i mean if there's one thing if there's one issue because the way i feel is if i don't vote then i don't have any reason to gripe uh-huh right to complain about it right right right and i hear so many people saying well i wish this would change i wish that and you know but they didn't go vote that's right and uh maybe if they like you said if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote and all that's right then uh and the importance of it because okay if you don't vote for your friend over here well your friend's not going to have a chance that is he needs your vote just like he needs everybody elses you know maybe if they were brought up that a way like you said it would because i know here uh until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines and you voted for like cheerleaders and different things like that but they should start that a lot earlier yes uh-huh yeah i it's the same way with everything in education though it should begin and right down in the first grade uh and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first second or third grade so that the children develop good learning patterns and have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning uh and not wait until they're in high school and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point right yeah but uh everything should be started on the lower levels and uh certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that you know they they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant and uh but it but you're right from the standpoint that people do have a negative attitude towards politicians right and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run uh that only the most wealthy can do so right and they're not always the best person for the job but they have the money to be able to do it so uh so that there are a lot of problems along that line also and perhaps the government definitely you know a good i idea for the young kids like that too is to have like a a mock one and okay this this candidate tells you some things that are going to happen and this candidate tells you some things okay then this percentage of the sure right voters i mean the kids in that class they are not going to let them vote this time but they have to do whatever these people whichever one the other people elect do if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them uh-huh okay now you're not going to get to vote but you're going to have to do what that person says they would understand probably by the time they were in high school they'd be ready to vote yes right that's right and i think you know that's an excellent idea they for them to realize that that their going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it and that maybe maybe to think twice about voting now some people object during primaries having to declare a party yeah right whether Republican or Democrat and you do that in the primary uh and i don't know that uh a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason uh-huh uh they can declare anything they want and they can actually rig it if they really wanted to vote Republican they could go in the primary and say they were voting Democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the Republican could beat but uh it's uh it's just a sad situation and uh i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to uh teach the people uh uh everyone uh more about what is going on with voting and with non voting so that uh we can make some start making some more intelligent decisions and it's going to take these young you know it's going to take the uh yeah i think that sounds great a whole generation of my feeling uh before that's going to be accomplished that's right well you know they'd have to start when they're real young i mean you know it would have to be a child that is just coming in the school because i well i'll tell you another thing too now whenever the first time i voted i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the voting machines now this sounds dumb but i did not know how to use those voting machines uh-huh and nobody ever showed us or anything so i didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question all the other kids laughed at them they thought that was funny oh she don't even know how yeah right uh-huh so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote and it took me i mean it took such courage you wouldn't believe to go vote the first time because i was waiting for somebody to laugh at me because i didn't know how to work the machines and sure right well sure it is now that's bad and i mean i was out of school i was a married person and um uh-huh i didn't know how to work the machine you know and it really scared me really bad because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine where if they'd if they'd had a class or something or just a short well just the just the opportunity to try the voting machines yeah time you know that that okay this is the way right it's this is the way it's going to be and my son was exactly the same way that i was and i didn't realize it until uh his senior year i said asked him something about well did you who did you vote for for uh cheerleader and he said oh i didn't go vote he said uh there's no way i'm getting in that machine well then i realized it so when we went and voted the next time i asked the uh lady i said i want my son to come in with me and she said well uh why you know he'll have to come back out i said because i want him to know how to use one of these and i said i won't turn any of the buttons down but i want to show him how to use it so that he'll be able to vote right yes uh-huh and uh so he went in and now he's a registered voter but he would not vote before that good yeah and i mean i think that's bad you know here i was and and even of course there's a lot of years between the two of us but even with that many years between the sure it is absolutely  talk about the activities that we don't do uh yeah i i don't have any children so but i i have a lot of friends with children and i know they spend a lot of time with them which is good that's good to hear yeah and i haven't uh well i've been around a lot of people lately at work at my job that don't have a lot of values you know so it's it's always nice to see people that like each other and like uh families that get along with each other and like to do things together yeah yeah they have a lot of values i love that do they have children um the one the the most valueless girl doesn't but she's married now i i'm not quite sure why i i think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him oh that's wonderful but it's it's it's it's kind of weighed on me and then the other day my husband and i met a couple who who're they're just gonna have their first child and they really like each other and they're real happy with one another and she says things like i'm really glad when he comes home and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening and i'm like oh that's neat really that's good you know i like to see that you know i have uh some friends that uh first of all yeah uh the girls joined they have two girls one joined the Girl Scouts and the other was in the Brownies and then the mother got involved as a leader and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp here in Dallas and then going out to um Betty Perot Camp and working with the horses and stuff and they're gone a lot and they take their girls and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even you know to do work with the Girl Scouts and i think it's neat oh yeah you know they've really become very much involved in in just that one organization which the organization can use the help too so i i wish i could see more of that you know right well on Sunday we just met uh a family we were thinking about getting Maine Coon Cat and we went over to a lady that breeds them here in town and uh her daughter actually it was her she said that her husband said to her daughter you need a hobby so she chose the cats and you can tell it's a family hobby the cats they're all a part of it and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and and the cats and they raise champion cats ooh those are neat cats too so they've done really well yeah i've just learned about that breed they're really nice looking cats i have seven cats but they're all mongrels well that's what we're gonna end up getting well they're the ones that need the homes oh yeah you know mine were just all um strays in the neighborhood little baby kittens dropped and stuff and it just kind of built one at a time just kind i couldn't you know one time two of them came at once and i can't turn a hungry cat down oh i know so you know and the last one that i picked was here uh the kids brought him over and said he was injured and it was winter time and i said i just cannot have another cat i just cannot have another cat and i looked out there and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all and i said i can't stand it i brought him in so oh those are my children we don't have very many activities but no i know what you mean our cat hates other cats and the we've tried to get her to like other cats and she just uh she wants to be around human beings and she does not wanna be around other cats so our next we're gonna try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out huh lots of luck is she spayed oh yeah real maternal yeah we're hoping it's our last hope she'll eventually i mean mine you know i have five males and two females everybody's spayed everybody's neutered and we still have a scrap every now and then nothing real bad you know a slap here and there but um they put up with each other and they will eventually her nose will be out of joint for a while and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then but they'll she'll finally accept it you know they really don't have any choice in my in my household we have a little bit of uh a fight for who's boss mean a male cats are are real you know real territorial and so that's the big battle here you know uh who's who's top dog well top cat i guess you know but um we i don't i don't know i don't have a problem with it i think they um-hum just learn to accept and i have two dogs too and they've slapped the dogs around too every now and then so yeah yeah that's true they've got to keep them in line yeah but she'll accept another cat eventually as long as you make her feel um like she's still loved and everything so yeah well those Maine Coon cats were great they were fourteen pounds and and they're oh they're just gorgeous but yeah three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten and i think of those i think of the kittens at the pound oh my gosh yeah three hundred and fifty dollars i just yeah yeah and they are lovely but ooh house payment that is is a lot of money right yeah and then she's saying you know you can't let them outside and you can't do all this stuff and i'm like ooh i don't let mine out anyway but i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then but my cats are inside i'm afraid you know with neighbors it people throw rocks at them and people run over them and i i just you know i just don't i know so and and now they've lost the desire most of them don't even try to get you know to go out i just have two that drive me crazy that i let out in the back you know but i won't let them get if they start going in the front and stuff i bring the m in oh you know i just worry i guess i'm too protective but you know i see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood and too they can catch diseases really easy just by touching a nose to another cat they can contact leukemia yeah yeah yeah feline leukemia so we know we try try real hard to keep them healthy uh we just bought a acre a house with an acre to try to so she'll she'll have some room to walk around and not off of a busy street we're we're choosing our house for our cat isn't that bad oh how neat people do it for their children i mean why not well you know why not why not oh them too well because i he loves she's one of those that loves outside and she doesn't go far but she just wants to be able to have that freedom yeah yeah well if you're off off a road you know away from a road and you're off of the main road you said away from a road you know and you keep an eye on her it's probably okay i'm just real yeah yeah i don't know i guess i'm in a neighborhood and it's it's just real tough on animals here you know when i every time i see one run over i just you know it makes me sick so yeah it gets hard especially with the cars oh i know you know but anyway we kind of got off the subject of children except that i consider them my children yeah yeah our cats are our kids or i we we got married a few months ago and i'm like well why can't Ashley be at the wedding yeah oh no in her little bridesmaid dress yeah you know if i could have i would have done it oh well i'm sure it's been done i'm sure it has been done well they have weddings for dogs now and cats and you know you they have all that parties for them where they dress up i've seen it in oh magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a party i haven't gone that far i'm not that bonkers you know my cats do not wear clothes and oh my no i i don't think they'd like to i put a bow on her one night on day and Jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person no no i took a picture of her and that was all it all it lasted for well do your do any of your friends have have uh older children that they do anything with do do you have friends with older children or they just all have young kids um yeah all the ones i know my brother-in-law has three young kids seven and on down and they they go on family vacations and uh they go like to go skiing the the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention but uh this last ski trip they took um she had contracted chicken pox first and then she spread it to her her little younger sister and her brother and they got it just at the beginning of the um no vacation where she got better so she not only is she the better skier but she got all the attention because she got to go out i think think she planned it she's only five but i think she planned and she got all the attention from her dad wow oh yeah love it oh say that she needed that didn't she you know it must be hard when you have a lot of children i you know to have i was an only child my mother was an only child so i you know i wasn't raised with brothers or sisters and i always got all the attention so i wouldn't know i think i would be extremely jealous or would have been had there been another child in the family yeah it's it's we can see it work with her it's she's frustrated tough must be tough yeah yeah oh she she's the middle one so she's never been the only one so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one yeah right yeah that's tough you know  so tell me about your home my home all right my home is about fifteen years old all right it's a two story house it it's a first home and it looks like it's going to be the last i think we're going to demolish it we've got two children and it's they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff you know yes put dents in the tiles just multitude of them i mean even places it's it's past the dent stage we're talking some of it's been peeled away you know i don't know what they we're talking from from dents into holes yeah dents into holes right i understand we've got i've got a daughter we've got two one of them 's eleven and one of them 's seven and then the carpet you know we need to replace the carpet oh i mean it sounds like it's just the pits but it's not all that bad i guess but you know they're just real hard on it kids are hard on houses definitely i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high and then they get another one yeah yeah uh we live in a mobile home and that's probably not typical America but i know there's a lot of them it's what we have it's what we can afford yeah and uh seems like we're always working on it as i'm sure it is with your house because they're always because they're always ruining something yeah how old is your child ten girl well so so you know just like yours ours is always you know we're something else goes wrong always you know it's some appliances breaking or something no appliances we had a couple plumbing problems we've oh who knows you know it's always something with homes and you said you were in Colorado Springs yes are there a lot of trailers around there yeah there are there's uh big military constituency and is that what you're in oh no no i'm i work for TI well then that's why you're doing this then isn't it oh yes okay well what division are you in i'm not in TI oh i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off and passed it on to people that were interested it's not a hobby you know it's something to do i get to hear about Texas again a bit get to talk to people all over the country the other night i talked to someone in Maryland i believe it was i know i've been talking to people in Ohio and uh Virginia and i think California it's interesting isn't it yeah it is you know the gal i talked to in Maryland didn't own a car she's never traveled anywhere she's never been anywhere she you know i talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being our roads and she didn't understand she doesn't drive how does she get to work uh she uh lives on campus a college student buses and and uh public transportation uh-huh i had a room her her parents live by the public transportation and i wish we could down here well it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom too don't you well sometimes but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work but if i did it it'd take me about an hour and fifteen minutes i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bus you know there's one terminal close to us and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here then i'd have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over a couple of blocks and get on another bus to go to my school right if it's anything like uh so that's too much Dallas always has been no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much yeah but there sure are a lot of people that work down there is the crime rate still bad definitely and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the curve streets you know just oh all around these vacant buildings there's a lot of vacant buildings and they're just being demolished huh and and they stink and beer and wine bottles all over the place huh-uh yeah huh that's terrible um-hum so Garland how nice is it now it's been a while since i've been there you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand it's gotten big yes it has i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that and i didn't realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from Dallas well yeah it is you know i know now where you from but i didn't i'm from Kilgore Texas it's in east Kilgore i know where Kilgore is oh where are you from i'm i'm originally from Lubbock are you yeah so why'd you move up to Colorado seemed like the thing to do at the time well it's real pretty up there i have a friend in Denver oh i love it the mountains i love the mountains what do you going uh back to the topic what it seems that uh more and more people are not owning owning traditional homes these days they're not owning homes period yeah yeah uh everyone says you know when i bought this several years ago w hen our local economy was good everyone said no no you're crazy to buy a mobile home uh-huh but now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and TI and straits it seems that uh it wasn't such a bad idea oh they're doing some backpedaling so have you got uh land no i'm renting at the time so i did that one year i lived with two other girls and we all taught it was a two bedroom so we took turns you know turns having sharing the bedroom yeah i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom and then we had two baths it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one ours is wood sided ours is wood sided that was in the seventies uh-huh and it has uh a traditional V top roof i'm sorry and uh it's nine hundred and eighty square foot one two bedroom one bath uh-huh rooms are nice sized well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath it's it's comfy so have have you got it underpinned yes are you required to by law i don't know whether it is or not we were down here it was already setup when we bought it yeah well i bet it's not bad oh yeah it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere and uh you know so it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be okay but how much is yours when we bought ours we were paying two uh three hundred and twenty nine dollars oh our payments are like two twenty for how many years fifteen oh so it was still a lot cheaper and uh what so it was still a lot cheaper than what we did because ours is thirty years and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house yeah oh yes a mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used and uh which probably didn't make much difference well yeah did have a on it no no no what i meant not in quality what i meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars in the price gee nice huh that sounds good so you know there's not that much time left on the loan and so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one another house i don't know no uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for you know i need to pickup and move somewhere else somewhere else is easy but you wouldn't take that mobile home right sure you would sure absolutely it'd be cheaper to move that than buy another one oh absolutely when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah yeah it would be cheaper uh especially if it were a paid move or something you know there's some paid moves occasionally TI would pay move you i don't know but they did when i when i moved up here so they might want to move away so how many years you been up there uh six or seven do you snow ski uh a little bit little bit mostly i just love walking the mountains driving in the mountains it's real pretty i went rock climbing one time oh that's exciting my friend talked me in that i'm a real um scaredy when it comes to heights but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite  we go so how do you rate gun control well i think uh i think on a scale of one to ten i would be i would be more toward a uh a uh uh an a stand that would not totally ban guns but would certainly very much control them uh i agree yeah i think that uh uh and and you know i i say this because i'm coming from a i'm coming from my my uh uh my parents my parents and relatives in Massachusetts are all avid gun owners my dad's got a big collection um-hum uh my brother's got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out and shoot and they're from the mentality that when uh uh guns were against the law only criminals owned them that sort of thing i agree but i uh uh i i think it's far too easy for people to get guns uh let me let me tell you a little a little more of of my background where i've really come to this position i i as i've told you before uh we lived in Malaysia for four years um-hum and it uh i tell you how against the law guns or any kind of firearms are uh it's a hanging offense oh my gosh to have a gun there's two offenses that are hanging one is to have a gun and the other is to is to deal in narcotics and and there's no appeal once you're found guilty the sentence is automatic so i guess they don't have a drug problem over there huh uh well it's interesting they do uh well they do and they don't not like we do here you can't buy it off the street corners but there's so much money to be made in drugs yeah that there's a lot of times not for selling in Malaysia but people go to Thailand and they have to bring them through the airport there the last two people that got hung weren't even trying to sell them there they were just uh caught with them oh no and and and the uh the law says that if you've got a certain quantity on you you're presumed to be a dealer uh-huh uh if you're a user the penalty isn't much much less you go to rehabilitation if you're a dealer then you get hung but anyway uh they they have some very strong antigun laws there and and uh like it's a hanging offense um-hum now uh yeah people get broken into and they get slashed up with knives but at least the person has to be next to you with a knife i mean you can outrun a knife but you can't outrun a gun that's right so uh the violent uh there is not as many people getting killed in robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here uh that's probably why i've come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to President Reagan you know the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily um-hum uh but i'm sure that they get a lot of publicity there's probably a lot of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally deranged people well um just recently i think it was Sunday on Sixty Minutes um-hum they had an article uh or uh a news story about uh gun control and in Florida they have started something where you know you always have to be eighteen or twenty one to buy a gun but um they've started where they do a background check and so um-hum yeah after you can go apply for this gun but it takes like seven days um-hum until you can get it and i think that's a good idea you know i'm not for total gun control because i feel like people need to protect themselves but um i think that you know the background check is a great idea right yeah i think it's a i i think it's great and i'm trying to think the uh secret service agent that got uh injured so badly when he was trying to protect President Reagan was it Brady yeah Brady and this is the law that's before the the legislature right now is is referred to as the Brady Bill right i didn't know about that yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place uh-huh see i think that's great but they also said on this um news story that that people can sell it to one another yeah and they wouldn't have to do the background check and i mean they went on to tell about all the the illegal guns and everything and that i think that Sixty Minutes bought some guns and um um-hum like an Uzi even and yeah and so you know there's a lot of controversy and people walk around at gun shows with their big guns on their back saying for sale and you don't have to do any background checking i mean any they would sell it to anybody yeah we you know i wonder i had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently i've never been in one in my life before and uh i was just looking around and and the majority of what they've got in there are guns uh-huh and i'll bet they don't i'll bet you don't i i would imagine legitimate gun dealers you'd have background checks but i'll bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop guy some money for a gun enough money that's right he he just picks it up over the counter and and i was i was really surprised that there you can get guns of any kind that you want you know the other thing is you had talked about the uh needing a gun to protect yourself and you know maybe someday we're all going to get wiped out by a robber here and then i'll change my mind but um-hum there's so many accidents with children accidentally getting a hold of guns yeah there is uh with the husband being out at night and the wife hearing rustling at the door he forgot his key wham he's gone uh i i absolutely don't want one in my house for that reason uh there's just too many things that can happen that are bad oh really well um my dad and my brother both have a collection of guns and um i don't know i guess we we've been taught responsibility when it comes to guns but accidents always happen but my dad has always keep kept his hid from us i mean even to this day i don't really yeah oh sure yeah you don't know really you don't know where it is right i know where his big gun is like his shotgun and stuff but um his pistols and stuff like that and he keeps those hidden and it is just for our protection it's you know if we did have a prowler he he keeps it like um he has the little rotary dial thing and like yeah yeah i think it's the second shot or the third shot the bullet's in there but i mean he'll give them two chances oh okay that's that's an interesting thing so uh yeah that the only way that would be a disadvantage if the other guy's got a gun and fires when he sees his and it's on it's on the first shot uh i think that uh uh and um right yeah i i i think that you know people have legitimate reasons for having them the only problem is so many people have them that don't have legitimate reasons for having them And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes of passion yeah uh you know a guy may have one at home for his protection but suddenly uh uh yeah wife or he gets in an argument with a neighbor and he goes home particularly when we get into the hot summers and his wife that's happening more and more often too oh sure he goes ho me and gets his gun out and comes back and shoot them there was a uh uh just recently here in Dallas i'm i'm trying to reconstruct it somebody jumped in front of somebody in line in front of a seven eleven and they got mad and they had a little argument over it so this one guy goes home and he is sitting talking to his his uh huh-uh uh brother about it and he sees the guy that jumped the line in front of him coming down the street so they got out and have more words and the second party went down to his house several houses down the street and got a gun and come back and shot the other guy and killed him oh my gosh and and and when they're available like that people who normally wouldn't do things like that but momentarily fly off the trigger that's right tend to uh uh uh uh tend to do that and then it happens in the in the cities a lot it happens in uh uh i i guess at certain times of the year tempers grow short um-hum and and it happens then and i i uh uh you you know my uh uh oldest daughter's fiance is a uh is a part part he's a college professor but he also is a reserve police officer and and he uh he has all kinds of guns and he's taken her out to teach her to shoot um-hum and uh uh you know i think that's good because she's not afraid of them and it it teaches her to be responsible relative to guns but uh when he's out on police work you know he leaves her home alone and shows them where they are in case she needs them and i worry about that i would almost worry about that more than if she didn't have one yeah because she might be um apt to go get it a little quicker than see what i mean yeah uh yeah yeah yeah years ago i lived in an apartment and one night i heard wham and boy it shock the apartment uh-huh and uh i came out and some girls came flying out of their apartment uh next to me and they asked me to come in and look and there was chips of wood all over the place and a big hole in the ceiling and a bullet comes to rest on the pillow beside one them's head oh no evidently it had ricocheted around the room well a young boy ten or eleven years old uh was living with his dad in the apartment up above and his dad's girlfriend was visiting and the dad took the girlfriend home and apparently the boy had uh he had a gun in there for protection so the boy was bored it was a three fifty seven magnum and he was sitting there spinning the chamber and it went off and actually shot his toe off and went through the ceiling uh through the his floor which was the ceiling of the apartment below that and i say ricocheted around the room a little bit yeah it was kind of scary yeah really if it landed on her pillow beside her if she had uh just rolled over yeah and it it it had about spent all it's energy but you could see there was splintered wood from all the places that it hit going around the room oh my gosh and and uh so i i uh i i think we're almost coming from the same place on this subject really yeah i do too i i i i think that that we don't want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection um i think i would rate probably a seven yeah i think i would too i think i would too just because um you're right i think that if we did ban them the bad guys would still have them yeah be uh well it's too late hey hey if i were starting my own country from the beginning i mean from the beginning i would probably like the country Malaysia is that where you said i mean they started it yeah Malaysia but of course uh it's also true in Great Britain oh really yeah they're not allowed in Great Britain either even the policemen don't carry them the policemen carry clubs but don't no i didn't know that  how do you uh manage your budget well let's see we or i sit down at the uh in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out and then i compare that to uh how much money we need to make and then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over we'll uh you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something and we're going to try to start saving as soon as we can we generally don't have a lot left over but as far as the long term our long-term goal is to to get out of debt um-hum and uh most most of our debts are from before we were married and we're trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things yeah well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford um-hum uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house and i've got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now yeah and uh the uh improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate i've expected so we're still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we haven't gotten out from under them yet yeah but uh so far we've managed to hold our own by uh trying to set up a a monthly budget yeah uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my wife um-hum to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car and then the rest of it's uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity uh water and uh and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills and those are pretty much fixed yeah yeah that's basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and you know those kinds of things uh we don't have a lot of uh you know like JC Penny's in our in our budget and uh maybe twice a year we're to where i can let my wife go clothes shopping like that and yeah let's see my mother-in-law lives uh not too far from here so she helps with our son's clothes when she can um-hum and that's real good and uh well at TI i have a real good benefits package for uh uh you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so that's not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously so yeah no my wife's pretty good about uh grocery shopping and yeah she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the kids really well that's neat uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items yeah like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh um yeah they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that wow so what do you do well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that oh wow and well that's good that you have the savings to get into then maybe we'll go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car breaks down so it's the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget wow yeah that's that's the way we are we've had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months yeah that uh really hit us hard but i've been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses so but we've never been we've been married for uh nearly four years and we've never been able to save any money and i think it's just hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it yeah even if it's you know ten dollars a week and so we're going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision well do you have some uh savings plans at work no actually i'm i'm not involved in anything like that at work or uh anywhere uh i don't have anything to fall back on at all yeah and i i know that's not wise but that's just uh where we're at right now my wife just went back to work part-time uh she can substitute teach at schools and uh there's so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work yeah you know everyday but we're we're just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and we're just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast we can yeah um-hum and there's and we're we're Christians and that's uh we've only been Christians for about five years but that's a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to to not be in debt and we're really starting to see the the the reasoning behind that um-hum and uh because we're you know we're always well i can't be sick this week but one day yeah or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am or you know i can't we can't go on a two week vacation because uh i wouldn't make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all time and you know we we really see how we're um-hum you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have yeah you know and that's that's really hard but so far we've never really uh been behind on any bills uh i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months um-hum and we had a a cutback at work and uh this is this was a couple of years back but anyway but we're doing really good we're not saving but we're staying right even well we've been looking around at uh uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some craft objects that we can market in the uh local stores oh yeah or uh uh making uh some dresses for children or things l ike that or even writing children's books yeah that's neat oh that's neat yeah and uh i tried uh this past year writing uh journal articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them wow oh wow because of the time uh well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with uh wow right buying reprints right wow yeah my my wife made uh a whole lot of crafts last year for Christmas presents um-hum and we didn't uh you know have to allot any well hardly very very much money anyway for Christmas just for our uh personal family just me and her and our son and i think her mom and that was really you know about it we we made everything else that uh we gave for Christmas last year um-hum yeah and she did really good with that oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with Christmas this past year um-hum but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the children's toys so coming up to Christmas time the girls didn't have any toys so we had to go out and oh wow wow oh no and get them a whole new set of playthings wow now i don't know how the dog has fared eating all that plastic and uh and stuffed animal stuffing but he's still here wow wow that's pretty pretty bizarre the dog ate the Christmas presents that's funny well anyway what uh is the economy doing pretty good there where you're at so far it's uh doing fairly well uh we're in the metropolitan Washington area and uh i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with uh beltway bandit type contracts uh our company is uh done fairly well um-hum and uh yeah what company is it i'm with the Melpar division of E-Systems oh of E-Systems okay yeah i see what do you all make uh we're primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business oh selling to the government  what movies have uh have you seen lately well the last movie i saw was Ghost i there's a lot out that i'd like to see i just don't have much opportunity i have a small child and it's gets so expensive right well that's true that's true if you have to get a babysitter and everything else yeah but you have to either yeah so but uh what have you seen uh i've seen Ghost we really enjoyed that i thought that was a good movie yeah i thought that was pretty good i thought that was a good movie and uh about a week ago we went out and saw uh Silence of the Lambs yeah and i guess i'm just not smart enough to figure that movie out that was just uh uh i don't know i really i didn't really enjoy it that much i have a friend who saw that and told he me said i don't want said don't go see it it because you won't be able to sleep but i don't know from all i've read about it i i i really think i'd i i'd like to see it i think it you know it probably was a good movie i just uh really didn't get into it that much but uh everybody i've talked to has just loved it and they want to go back and see it you know two or three times yeah really um but uh there's a lot of little things that go on in the movie that you have to uh really pay attention to uh to get the total gist of it really yeah but well i do i enjoy going to the movies and i tell you i've try to there we have a dollar theater i don't know where do are you in Dallas or uh yeah in Dallas okay well i live in Carrollton okay and there's a new dollar theater that's real nice and so uh huh see i took him and a friend to to see uh Kindergarten Cop a couple of weeks ago was that a pretty good movie you know it it was so uninteresting that i don't even remember what it was about oh really is that really the the kids seemed to enjoy it and then uh let's see uh before the week before that i took them to see Look Who's Talking Too which was just awful it was that bad huh oh was it i mean even the dollar it wasn't even worth a dollar uh the first one was much much better i in fact i enjoyed enjoyed the first one Look Who's Talking oh Lord right yeah i i saw the first one and i i thought that was you know pretty humorous but the second one's just it's more it really hardly has anything to do with the kids it's more about their relationship and they're just always fighting and they break up and they you know get back typical you know i see i see typical plot right huh so but i was real disappointed in that and then Kindergarten Cop like i said i you know i just i don't even remember it my mind must have just been somewhere else so don't even remember it right another movie that i've seen that was pretty good was uh Sleeping with the Enemy oh i'd like yeah i want to see that one too that was a good movie that that was one movie that uh i wasn't ready for it to be over with really it was pretty predictable towards the end but uh i still thought it was a good movie yeah i definitely want to see that have you seen uh The Doors no i haven't no i haven't i haven't seen that either i uh when it first came out it was like hey you know i've really got to go see this movie and now that it's been out awhile it's kind of like well maybe i don't really have to go see it right right and i haven't uh talked to anybody that's seen that i don't know uh what anybody's views are on yeah don't think i i haven't either and it's had terrible reviews oh really yeah i see have you seen the movie Flatliners it's out on video now yeah yeah i rented the video i thought that was pretty good yeah that was uh pretty suspenseful so my same friend that told me not to go see Silence of the Lambs also told me not to see Flatliners so i don't think i trust his judgment oh okay so they've got a they've got a weak stomach then huh i don't think i uh i think if uh i enjoyed Flatliners i rented that not to uh just about a week or so ago and i i like Julia Roberts right right she is a a good actress did you see uh oh that movie with her and Dolly Parton and Steel Magnolias seems like uh Steel Magnolias yeah i just watched that yesterday or Sunday i just watched that really i enjoyed that movie i thought that was a good movie yeah that was pretty good i heard it was a real tearjerker so i was pretty much prepared and i knew that she i knew that she died so i was prepared for that just i still cried but i was i was prepared for it prepared i see oh Lord and uh it seemed like every time i turn on the movie channel Pretty Woman is on right have you seen that that that's a good i think that's just a cute real cute movie yeah that really is and i didn't think that i was going to enjoy that uh just from what people had told me about it and and i thought well it's not going to be that good but i i really did enjoy that uh-huh yeah i did too and anymore uh my wife and i are getting bad we we wait until videos come out instead of going to the movie theater yeah uh for the very reason you know it's just so expensive well uh yeah with the dollar theater though i it's sometimes it's cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to you know to pay it depends on where you rent your videos but that's true that's true plus a lot of movies you need to sort of see them in a theater you know it just makes them that much better yeah i'm glad that i'm glad that i saw Ghost before it went right because it's out on video now but it's still playing at the dollar theater i'm glad i got to s ee it there rather it's TV just doesn't have the same impact right right because you can always you'll either get interrupted with a telephone call or want to get up and leave and that just doesn't make the movie you know you need to just sit through it and and enjoy it yeah uh yeah for ones that you want to see again or you know ones that you really weren't sure if you wanted to see or not you know right right that you didn't want to waste the time or the the expensive movie ticket then the videos are worth it yeah yeah there's another one i want to see is uh uh Dances with Wolves i haven't seen that and i and i you know it of course won a lot of Academy Awards right but i've heard that it's real it's a long movie that's what i've heard that uh like three hours right and uh but uh i've heard the scenery is real good in it yeah really i've heard a lot of good things about it but i've also heard that it can it becomes slow oh there's parts in it that don't move yeah yeah so i don't know you know speaking speaking about making a three hour time commitment i don't know i bet that's true that's right that's all afternoon i'll tell you what but uh so but uh yeah there are a ton of movies out seems like a lot just uh you know the first three months of this year seemed like there's been a lot of movies come out i thought i wanted to see the The Marrying Man with uh Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger but then we saw a uh like a preview of it and it looks pretty formula you know yeah oh really so oh i don't know now if i want to see it now it's like now i'll probably wait until it's either at the dollar movie or on video or on the video that's right but and what else what else is out right now that i want to see uh let's see there was another movie that i saw a preview to that i wanted to see uh something about cowboys uh uh All My Heroes Are Cowboys or is that new yeah it's it's pretty new uh i'm trying to think who it's got in it i guess uh uh there's a song by that name i guess but it's not new uh yeah it's uh that song that Willie Nelson song is in it yeah um but it's about this this guy that's a rodeo big rodeo guy and he comes home to his dad oh okay yeah and he's i don't know in a rest home or something and then they go off and do something i don't really know what all it was but uh yeah i think i've seen you know commercials yeah yeah yeah they sound like that'd be a pretty good Western movie but i i don't know yet uh i'll just have to save my money i guess and splurge a little bit yeah but well hey i appreciate the conversation yeah it was nice talking to you you have a good day bye okay you have a good day bye-bye  okay do you have any pets yeah i have three cats and a dog oh boy sounds like us yeah go ahead um uh we just got the the dog less than a year ago so he's still a puppy oh what kind is it he's a mixed breed he's part Collie part Shepherd and part Chow oh so he's got more Collie and Shepherd than Chow the only Chow he's got is is his tongue oh he's got a blue tongue oh yeah he's got little spots on them we have two Chows and a miniature Schnauzer and recently added a guinea pig which wasn't by my choice but i was out ruled so but the dogs are mine mainly mine and my husband but i just love them to death was the guinea pig for your for your child daughter yes yes as if the dogs weren't enough had to have a guinea pig so anyway she's she enjoys her though so that's that's what matters but um our Chows we've had them i'd say right around six maybe seven years and they're um really registered and we've been breeding them she's had about four or five litters oh my my husband's always wanted a Chow but i'm kind of concerned about um with having cats oh uh-huh and how how they socialize with cats um which is one of the reasons why we got a mixed breed um because we we thought they would socialize easier right um-hum um my husband had originally wanted an Akita and his brother has an Akita and he so far he's bitten ten people um-hum um oh man so goodness and the people that he got the Akita from used to have cats and they no longer have any other cats so uh it's telling them yeah when we had um we had a cat when we first married no yeah we had the cat first and then we got um the Chows and bring them bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her and uh you would think you know that they were all dogs the way she would prance around them and and paw at their face and they'd just play and they were never they never harmed her um-hum so uh they got along great now i don't know how how it would be bringing in uh cat to a full full grown dog yeah i i wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog but i i wouldn't feel yeah um hesitant about bringing a puppy in to adult cats i think they would socialize easier right i think so too um how how old is your child five she five so you had the dogs before you had the baby right and i was not really concerned about um them harming her uh i think i think a lot of that that that we hear all the time is how you bring them up um-hum and ours are real friendly they're protective but they're very friendly and lovable i mean you think they're lapdogs uh-huh you know they'll just come jump on your lap and want to be have their bellies rubbed and everything and what color are they uh the female's red and the male is black oh i bet the black one's pretty yeah he is he's a big old thing and um i was concerned about the female mainly and as luck had it uh she had puppies the same week my daughter was born so it was kind of like she had her babies and understood about about your baby you know yeah and and i think that really helped and um my daughter you know since since she's little has been playing with them and they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever and she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so yeah i think it's good for kids to grow up around pets as as long as they don't have any allergies to them or anything but i think it really helps them to so i do too yeah understand when when uh they go to other people's houses and they have pets i see so many times kids just you know being mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings yeah exactly that or or uh the other extreme they're they're terrified of them and i hate that and they shouldn't be i mean some maybe but but um yeah yeah like our miniature Schnauzer she's just she's just like um a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly and a lot of kids are scared of that and which i understand because she is you know a lot of movement and everything but when she calms down they're so scared of her it's it that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing she wouldn't hit you know harm them at all um and and and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children so i think i think it's a good idea to have them we've had a um in the past we've had birds too uh like cockatoos uh-huh and parrots and uh now are the are the cockatoos are those the big ones the big white yeah birds with the the orange crest on top yeah we've had those and those are neat they're messy very messy yeah and loud oh a lot louder than a dog you know a dog you can stop barking you know or whatever but the birds you it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever but are they yeah but they were neat enjoyable animals to have well we've thought about getting an aquarium partly because partly for the cats i think the cats would really enjoy it um um-hum yeah with a lid yeah yeah of course um but so far we just uh and and starting up an aquarium an aquarium we we're thinking about getting a saltwater and they're so expensive to start up oh yeah they yes yes they are and in your the luck of keeping them alive through those first you know few days yeah yeah but the the saltwater fish have so much more color and they're so much more beautiful i know they are um the freshwater tank's just really to me they don't there's most of them really aren't that pretty no i really don't i really don't care much for them right i don't blame you there i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than i don't know those fish fish are just beautiful just it's like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something something rather than just little fish yeah yeah but i don't mind having my daughter had a like a little goldfish uh-huh about a year or two ago and it finally died and that was neat but it and they're you know she can't play with it you can just look at it and yeah yeah you know you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat and yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't dare have a a goldfish here because uh it it it would probably be in a small bowl and then my cats would knock it over i have to be real careful about yeah um-hum where i put things if the cats will will jump up on things and knock things over all the time oh no oh no they're always up where they don't where they're not supposed to be yes yeah and that's hard i know that's that's just like kids you know you you they know that they're not supposed to do it but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to that's right and they're so independent i love having them for that reason yeah yeah and until we got the dog um it was real easy to to go to town for three day three day weekend or whatever and now sure it's like a major production trying to find somebody to take care of the dog while you're gone um-hum um-hum that's right that is hard and i we knew it but we never even thought that about when we got the dog we just saw him oh he's so cute let's take him home you know and then the first weekend we had him we had we were in a apartment in a two bedroom apartment oh yes um-hum and my husband went out of town and left me with with the brand new puppy and i had to work twelve hours that day oh fun oh no and so i left the dog locked in the bedroom and i put paper all over the floor well when i came home i opened the door and there were chunks of carpet padding oh oh oh no everything all over the place and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door oh no i guess you didn't get your deposit back did you well i had the carpet fixed um i yeah i didn't even tell the apartment managers about it oh good oh okay oh no bless your heart but that that was my first real experience with with with a puppy when when we had our family dog growing up i was eleven or twelve i think when we first got him and i wasn't really involved in the the the um-hum paper training and you know teaching him commands and stuff so this was and to me a whole new experience only it wasn't like cats at all sure yeah yes it is no no i wish it was i wish they were in that instinct but they don't our only problem with our Schnauzer she's an indoor dog most of the time and so um-hum uh we finally she's right at a year and we finally got her you know house trained and everything uh her only problem is trash if you do not pick the trash up you know the container and put it on a table or chair or something she'll knock it over i don't care how full full she is so it's not like she's hungry it's just she wants to get into trouble um-hum my cats do that it if i throw anything away that's any kind of meat or anything like that anything that um-hum that they think is good they'll get into the trash and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it and how how tight you have the lid down on it they'll get into it yeah yeah i've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor oh i hate that and the cat's just looking at me like sorry uh yeah you shouldn't have left it there i just hate that when she does that i just oh and she knows it's wrong you'll walk in the door and she'll cower and go hide under the table i couldn't help myself um-hum so you she knows she does wrong but she uh she continues continues to do it so yeah and the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not really he's actually not really a puppy anymore he's like sixteen months old um-hum um but he's still chewing oh is he um the last thing he chewed up was uh when we  well Wayne i've never done any uh auto repairs myself at all i mean i may have screwed in a little screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something but uh i personally haven't done anything maybe um-hum i've uh changed wiper wiper blades or something but i have noticed since uh i got married that my husband he hates to do auto repairs but he would rather do them himself than than to pay someone else i guess he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows he knows how to do it and to do it so he he hates the time that he takes but he has changed um the brakes and he has done all of the tune-ups and the things like that and recently he changed the steering mechanism in our car um-hum i was really impressed with that we had to have it to get the car inspected it wouldn't pass inspection and and so he priced around and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it so he thought well i can get one in a junkyard for like fifty dollars which he did and then he did it and i so i guess uh he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up what uh what's your experience been like well i uh i have a long experience with cars i uh when i was younger uh my brother had a Corvette and i bought a Corvette when you have a Corvette you more or less do all the work and i've done everything from build the motor from the uh you know the bare block on up and i i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car i hate to go pay somebody good money you know i hate to pay somebody twenty five dollars an hour for something i can do myself it just to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that in fact i um just this past weekend put new plugs in both uh my car an my wife's car um-hum right um-hum and so i uh i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself but i've i've gotten to the point in my life um you know i just crept over forty years old where i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore i mean it's uh that makes sense i don't know whether i've i've just reached a point you know it's it's real rough in the winter time huh yes and uh and so i try to make sure that uh by the time fall runs around because we actually have winters here on the east coast um that uh i have you know the car's in pretty good shape enough to last through the winter right and uh then spring time i usually end up giving them uh a uh tune-up and make sure that they're running well and uh yeah it's like i had the muffler go out on my on my car shortly before it was required to go in Maryland they have uh emission tests um-hum and you're required to get your car to go through the emission test well my muffler of course starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test so you know i had to do that job and of course that was back in December when it's nice and cold outside yes i'm sure it was but the thing was that i could do the job myself i mean the parts cost me oh roughly a hundred dollars um if i'd taken it someplace to have it done it was going to be three hundred twenty five um-hum right now like who's got that extra two and a quarter i know i don't so yeah well that's exactly the way he feels is that he really hates to spend the time it takes a lot of time if he if he thinks it's going to be two hours it's four if you know whatever it always takes him twice as long but then when he's finished he's he always says well now you owe me three hundred dollars and then he thinks that he has the money that that he can spend on something and he hasn't given it to someone else so he gets some satisfaction out of that although yeah generally i think he he does not look forward to or anticipate there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars there's a lot of people and he just isn't one of them yeah i uh i don't mind it um there was a time when i had my Corvette i mean of course i loved it um but i've you know i've got other interests now and there's a lot other more important things i think i should be doing with my time um-hum and i have the same problem i mean you can tell him from me but it doesn't matter i mean i've i've had greasy fingernails for years and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job yeah so but think i think the difference is that uh when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing um-hum and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right and you know i've i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it right you know like a spring that was put in incorrectly which could have resulted in brakes failing and me having an accident you know those kind of things and when you have a vehicle that's being used by you know other members of your family you know you don't want right that kind of a situation to come up no and it's very very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car and uh he's about uh sixty miles from here um-hum and so it and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle i'll take it to him to do it right you know that it's uh really has a bad reputation is to feel that that people in general feel and have have rightly so i think been cheated many times and um uh-huh yes and well i know once when we had a we usually round inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car but um once the muffler needed to be changed and uh he had looked at it himself and but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change he said that's really really good so he went in and uh but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something anyway but the car that the muffler people had um my at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further you know they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever and so since then i don't think he's ever even seriously considered a you know any kind of job he thought he could do himself uh-huh but i know from his childhood he says his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment i guess and um so Kelly growing up he uh-huh he felt like that that was a good way on Saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father uh-huh and so he used they used car repairs kind of as a way to have uh you know something that they did together yeah and he thought that turned out pretty good because it you know it helped him to understand and be functional now and it helped him to have a close relationship so that's one one way he looked at it yeah that's probably uh uh something that uh is is you know is good for both of them i know that uh my older son i could never get him interested in cars and i couldn't you know i just like you know you sure you're a boy i mean your not interested in cars i mean he he just would not have anything to do with them and uh later on and uh like when he you know grew up got out of the house and got his own car um he didn't know how to do anything to it i mean absolutely nothing i mean he couldn't even check the oil i mean that's that's how uninformed he was and disinterested um-hum and i guess there are some people out there like that um you know i always thought maybe you know if he took more of an interest and you know what i was doing and maybe we could have communicated better um-hum but uh yeah i i think that's great yeah it didn't always work well i felt um i feel like i could myself do some things but that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home and my husband that's willing to do it i go ahead and let them do it i don't feel the need to um you know be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things i'm i'm happy to let them run run the cars because i have so many other responsibilities that um so i haven't tried to do a lot myself uh i i trained my uh my wife in the house in in doing things in fact uh when i uh first transferred down to uh Texas Instruments back in nineteen eighty seven um um-hum uh when i left here uh she had to change a set of plugs in the car because she was up here for a month or so after i was uh-huh and uh it was an interesting experience for her i mean she'd always assisted me and done some other things but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was uh it was something a little different hum it's a good experience it helps you feel i think comfortable with your car and feel like it's not so scary if um you're driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might you think well i've i've been under that hood and i know what's going on but uh yeah yeah i think it's important that everyone know you know basically how how the darn engine works it helps you figure out what's wrong with it you know i've i've been out with my sister before when um-hum um-hum you know her car died on the highway and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all  okay we're talking about uh car repair the last car repair i had done on mine was last February it was uh uh my car was inspected and then they said that the brakes weren't adjusted properly and i had to go have it uh adjusted and it turned out that they needed repair and it cost like three hundred dollars the brakes to have that yeah for the brakes what uh what did you have to have done to the with the brakes oh i don't know they had they had a whole list of things you know you need to have this turned and that you know refinished i don't know i don't understand the whole process my personally which is one reason why i don't trust the auto repairmen i guess uh these car repair places but uh i hate to take it anytime because i know they're going you know say oh you need this you need that and everything else in the book uh so i don't know i haven't had a terribly good experience a lot of times with car repair places uh years ago when i was living in California i went to my my my clutch cable had popped on my car the clutch had broken or something i don't know what was wrong so i took it to uh a transmission shop uh nationally recognized name and uh they had said uh well they he called me back that afternoon and they said oh yeah you need this you need that your transmission's faulty and all this and it was like you know six hundred dollars jeez and i said wait the car's not worth that much it's it's uh an eight year old car and it's not worth that much uh i'll just have to do later i said i don't don't do anything with it because i'm i'm not worth that much money on it and i went there after work my wife and i went there after work and uh they had the whole thing down and taken apart um-hum so i told the guy i said you know i didn't authorize this i said you put it back together i'm taking it home and the guy said well it will have to be another day before we get it put back together i started to go get a lawyer um-hum you know because i didn't authorize anything and so he went and got his manager and the manager came out and says i'll give you the parts at cost i'll give you the labor for a hundred dollars and so for two hundred fifty dollars we'll do it all for you oh really yeah so i thought well he'll meet me halfway i'll meet him halfway so it all this work done for like two hundred and fifty dollars but still you know the the element of trust was gone at that point yeah that's their way of capturing your pocketbook i guess for those who are least suspecting in a lot of regards i mean uh actually you probably had a better deal that way yeah it was i'm sure it was so i got my uh transmission fixed with all my clutch um just the other day my clutch cable had had popped again and uh last year i i took it my car to a friend of mine to have the oil changed he worked at a at a car lube place and uh i asked him if he could adjust the clutch any because it was kind of loose and he looked at it and said sure he pulled the clutch cable out from inside the engine area and pulled the clip out that was attached attached to it and put it back further on on the cable well it was fine so i watched real carefully and and then my clutch cable broke uh i went and uh i got a new uh clip that i had with me i bought an extra one and i just went there and and replaced it and was back moving again within three minutes and um-hum there i was stuck on the road right in the middle of traffic but i managed to get it going again relatively quickly because i knew i watched what he did and was able to do it really fast and you know i just figured that if i'd taken it someplace they would have said oh you need a new clutch cable and this and that and you know two hundred fifty dollars later there it is you know gee i don't know i don't have much trust in those people but how about your experiences well i generally try to find my own personal car mechanics yeah uh rather than taking it to a shop i'm kind of like you it's uh i kind of equate them with some bad dentists yeah who try to find problems in your teeth which i have had that experience yeah and that's a different subject so i better stay on cars but the last problem i had with my vehicle was a uh fuel pump that needed replacing and that's all the major problems i've had for a vehicle that's got eighty nine thousand miles what kind of car you got it's a Nissan okay that that explains it yeah i've got an American made car yeah yeah it's it's been very good to me i i'm going to uh i i would eventually like to get into an American car but right now this one's doing fine for me yeah but then the other problem too is just a fuel filter and the fuel pump and i've had to replace a set of tires a couple times but that was due to quirks uh if you ever have a flat tire uh-huh don't ever have it plugged have a patch put on it okay because those plugs wear eventually will wear out all four of your tires oh is that right yeah because it causes an unevenness in the rubber and uh that happened to me twice before i caught on well enough to what what happened hum i had uh one tire uh plugged after a flat and somehow the unevenness of the plug just caused all all the other three tires to wear out huh that's odd so always have a patch put on that's good to know though it's it's happened to me twice and that's enough yeah it is that's more than enough well other than that that's the major problems i've had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it yeah i do that myself i mean i i take it for places so because i figure for for eighteen dollars they'll mess with the oil and they'll mess with getting the things off and all that you know and it's just it probably costs me at least six seven eight dollars to do it myself i figure for an extra ten dollars let them take care of it yeah you're you're saving about uh ten bucks by doing it yourself but what the heck if you can afford it yeah um i'd rather change it myself myself but i don't have the facilities well enough all the time yeah that's right uh so that's the only major problems you've had then who me yeah oh my clutch has gotten out a couple times and uh what kind of vehicle a Chevette Chevette yeah yeah let's see what else have i had done uh one day i was driving with my dad and the uh he was driving in fact and the uh uh stick shift came out in his hand he driving down the road um gee whiz it just totally disengaged itself and you know of course then we had no way of of doing anything at that point we had to tow it home and uh and all that and it was like good grief and the car was new at that point it was only like a year or so old um-hum uh and uh other things were going out on it you know and these repair people say oh you need need your your your your this and your that's gone out and it's like good grief i don't even know what they do um-hum so how am i supposed to trust them i don't know yeah the only thing you can do is somehow through your own network and the friends find a mechanic through them yeah that's all you can do that they trust and and then i'm sure that that mechanic's not going to do you in through their recommendation yeah i was uh i had my car taken in uh to have the oil changed at the the place across from the the TI plant in Lewisville and uh they told me he says oh your your belts are all worn out and they need to be redone uh it'd be like sixty dollars so i thought is that right i don't remember that having seen that they're that bad so i took it to a friend of mine's house and he looked at them he took the belts off and looked at them and he says no they're not cracked or anything they're they're they're in pretty good condition all i had to do is tighten them a little bit they need little bit of tightening now what was it there's was some belts that needed to be tightened the belts um-hum they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced um-hum so yeah i i know this guy that's a car mechanic and he told me i told him my belts are slipping a little bit and he said they'll last forever all you got to do is just tighten them yeah yeah uh every time my dad had taken his car in to be worked on and they did something with the belts and they when they took the old belt off they cut it um-hum and looks like it's a standard deal easiest way to get it off and uh they just let it hang where it was basically instead of just taking it off and throwing it away and when he got home he noticed some strange sounds so he opened it up and looked in there and there was the old belt wrapped around one of the uh axle things in there um-hum um-hum totally took him a half-hour to cut it off and it totally engaged itself around the thing and boy was he he boy was he irate hum which i don't blame him you know he'll i think he went back and showed it to them and really chewed them out for it there's no excuse for that you know if your going to cut it off just grab it take it throw it away it's simple um-hum um-hum oh well that's all i got to say yeah i don't have that much problems so with my vehicle knock on wood yeah excuse me i just remember a seventy nine Chevy Nova that i once had never again yeah that was a definite lemon yeah that's what year mine is so that's the problems problem i guess well i got rid of that one after it cost me megabucks mine mine's still running it's twelve years old and it's got uh seventy two thousand miles on it now so that's not bad no not that much  okay Dee are you familiar with the Latin American policies of late um yeah to a point it's not my best subject um-hum really yeah it's not mine either but uh i know i know our policy i like in Nicaragua i'm familiar with that because we have um some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border and they're they're missionaries there and they they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff and uh i know that they helped a lot of those Sandinistas refugees coming across the border and they housed them and stuff they've been down there about three years now and they lived it's kind of weird they have bats in their roof but the bats eat the bad spiders so they leave the bats you know so uh yeah it's a whole whole different culture um it it's weird down there because uh-huh there's all lizards and things running around that people who live there they just they take it for granted and it's like we go down there on vacation it's like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house um-hum yeah i think their policy with them that though is um i don't know i think i wish we would have just i'm not that up on the policy of way i know that's kind of old but i don't know i just i'm glad that the Sandinistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were very wicked and uh probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen and i feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs yeah their very corrupt like the Panamanians Panamanians are were very corrupt yeah right the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot of American servicemen are involved um-hum because i guess there was a big big uh scam they they set all these guys up and like a dozen servicemen got caught for running a drug ring um-hum yeah um so it's it's like everybody is into it it's just greed human greed interestingly about about that country is in Honduras yeah um-hum it's very pro American um-hum and we have i my girlfriend used to uh be in the Navy and she was based uh based in Panama uh-huh in Honduras its very um uh pro American and there's a lot of American i don't know how many American uh soldiers are there but there's a lot i mean they uh uh-huh uh and you can't the American government you can't trust them either because you think you don't know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and things like that i mean it's the lesser of two evils they'll probably you know say this is the lesser of two evils um-hum yeah but i don't know how corrupt the Honduran government is but the yeah i they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption but i think first though i don't know they need to i think turn these people in the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their uh you know the atrocities that they've commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes because i feel like a lot of the leadership of those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they're moved from power that you know but there are so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off you going to have another one and i know a lot of those nations there's uh Brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical Christian not just go to church but you know really on fire for God and they're just surpassing America Latin America by the drugs you know it's just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that God's going to honor that and that he's going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe Costa Rica is a Christian and he goes to no Guatemala because he goes to Virgo Church in Guatemala City our church is in real close relationship with him and he is a former president of Guatemala he's an elder at Virgo Church and you know that that God is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in Guatemala that he can't have another term so they're the people are trying to override that i mean not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice so yeah yeah good see that's the thing that is going to have to that's the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean um-hum talk about the crime and all that in the city it's just the kids have no morals that's the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background right um-hum um but it's funny you will mention Costa Rica because i guess they're one of the most successful and peaceful countries in Central America um-hum yeah i know so i was reading an article in uh National Geographic and i don't know i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries they don't have oil or anything and they don't have big tourism um-hum so maybe it is their faith that has enabled them to keep the crime out uh-huh i know that Costa Rica they don't allow anybody to come in that um to come in any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants they don't allow anything like that like i could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen they would not permit me to move there to work they wouldn't their jobs are there for Costa Ricans they don't allow people to move in like less nations you know and take the jobs yeah they don't they don't probably don't take a lot of refugees from other countries either no they don't take any i mean i couldn't even go there my husband couldn't we would have to receive all this special permission to go there for even when some you know in in inner company you know transfer or something and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there she's Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time and stayed i've been there twice and stayed and that was that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money quit loaning it to them you're not going to get it back don't be indebted to anybody don't be the you know loaner nor borrower and it's just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i don't think we're loaning anymore now but that's how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back yeah also uh uh Mexico that we will loan the money in uh a lot of the higher the higher people were just stealing it and building these beautiful homes and nice ranches and things so we are we're suckers um-hum right uh-huh Lo Mas yeah yeah we we are now it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them you don't loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and they know they're not going to pay it back that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and it's just a big mess so you did you go to Mexico City uh anywhere near when the earthquake hit no but i knew people i was there before that but i knew people i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed and they were living in a tent so it's kind of weird you know because these were people he was on the US dive the Mexican diving Olympic pool he'd go watch them dive and all this so they were you know just normal people weren't squatters or poor people or anything that um i did i knew all of my friends there but none of them that i know of got killed in it but um they're all Christians though God really protected them see that broke out a revival in Mexico City that CBS new s and ABC never told you about there's been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake because there's a lot of man there's a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft oh i could imagine so a lot of it in the name of Christianity oh really so you know oh yeah there's a lot you know they call themselves Christians but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and just a whole the lot of it generational things too like the Mayans and the Incas you can't find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were and yet they're revered and honored and almost worshipped by so many people even now in America you know everyone's all intrigued with all of these Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth because of how wicked they were i've been down to the pyramids and i've climbed to the top of the pyramid of the sun where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy and then hold it up to the sun God and that's pretty heavy duty you know yeah is is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away all through the years i don't think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun it's black so yeah you can't really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and is it do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there because um at that time i kind of did it was a very oppressed eerie just you know feeling but i wasn't a Christian when i went there but uh i think that all those those you know generational things i think that God did i'm praying you know that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things you know those in your background  hi Maureen how are you all right well do you have a family budget no we probably should but we haven't so why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done which you've found useful and workable okay we do a few things and i have to say we're my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds i i'm an accountant uh-huh and uh he has an MBA so uh we were sort of you know keyed in on expenses and things like that so um um okay coming from that background what we pretty much do is we our household as far as living expenses we live on a cash budget every month my husband uh goes to the credit union and withdraws you know X amount of dollars for the month and then that money is used during that month we have a certain budget uh-huh excuse me for instance i control all the household expenses the groceries uh the haircuts the gasoline for my car any miscellaneous expenses babysitting things like that and uh uh-huh excuse me if uh it comes the end of the month and i don't have any money uh we don't buy any more milk uh-huh but uh we've gotten pretty good at it we've been doing it a couple of years now uh-huh so we our budgets are realistic and they are not so stringent as you know to make us feel uncomfortable hm uh and i i really try to stretch my my dollars here and there shopping uh at warehouses sometimes like at Sam's and things like that uh-huh but uh we live we live on on a cash budget and it sometimes it's tight come the end of the month but generally we always make it what do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for the you know are sometimes several hundred dollars like uh tires for the car or car repair of some sort or like a a dental bill or something that you're not prepared for right well uh most of our medical things we don't uh have to worry about because of insurance and they're they're relatively small uh we've been lucky in the past we didn't have that problem but right now we don't for the other things the things that crop up that we aren't really expecting we have different funds set aside for different things like we have a car fund and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not oh so i mean and i i can't really remember what it is do you kind of continue call this like a part of savings account or a different savings account it's all part of the savings account we just keep track of it on paper uh you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account we decide okay you know let's say it's a hundred dollars you know every month fifteen dollars is for car fund uh you know ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever uh and oh we just we constantly do that so that there's a build up of money for those things if something does come up like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day and oh okay so but we have the money set aside so if it does it's not going to kill us hm uh so we're we're actually we're pretty disciplined so it makes those surprises not so uh-huh difficult to get through okay then so like your pay what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that you know will cover all of the expenses kind of thing well in or like what what percent do you then save or something uh we have a lot of different things right now we save about twenty five percent of our of our pay hm okay it and it goes toward different things it's for you know for vacations like i said for you know emergencies like for car uh breaks down something like that uh and we also put money aside for our kids college uh-huh uh-huh neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so we're starting our kids a little bit early oh okay do you uh use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things checking account a lot uh not so much credit cards now several years back i used to use charge uh charge cards and you know all the time kind of thinking oh well it's on sale you know it must be a good deal and uh-huh sure there have been times that i have been bad about the credit cards and so pretty much now uh we don't use them too much if we travel or something yeah but you know uh-huh standard we usually don't or if it it is a purchase uh then it's paid off when the bill comes you know so it isn't any extended uh it may be that i picked up something at the store but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then so it's not any you know uh build up on the charge cards at all that's good and but that hasn't always been the case so i'm kind of i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things uh you know in the past and i don't have you know big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest rate just is a killer oh and it's not deductible anymore yeah well i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow but uh or you can get deduct anyway yeah pretty much when i always i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks yeah we did we did that for a long time and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when hm things cropped up you know so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget well the first time we did it we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be and then we kept track of everything for a month uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you know how much we spent on food how much we spent on gasoline how much we spent on everything and from that built you know a cash budget so now i mean i have uh-huh i don't remember what it is now four hundred dollars for the month let's say and uh i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else and uh-huh some months it may be different it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves you know down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing uh-huh but the way we set up you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for you know uh utilities and uh the house payment and all that those are things you don't really have much control over yeah uh-huh uh the cash budget just fits right in there like i said if we don't have we also set aside money for entertainment i mean it's but again it's a set amount every month uh-huh and uh on special occasions i mean birthdays and things like that we we don't we still have fun on things yeah uh we are in the process of trying to buy a house do you know how did your budget work or did you have a budget to uh get your down payment going to get a house well no not originally because when we we did buy when we bought our first house it was at a time where you and the kind of loan we got you really didn't have to put down anything huh so we got into it fairly cheaply and then uh after we sold the first house we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house oh okay so we we got out of that one pretty easily okay uh yeah i just keep thinking all the time i mean it it's really rough to keep yourself on a strict budget for a long long time when your you know your priority at least mine is to save for the house but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime sure i know that's how i feel sometimes about my kids' education i mean jeez they are one and four we have got a long time to save my husband he's the real he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually uh-huh oh no no well i know but there are times when i sit there and i think wow you know we make X amount of money and where is it i mean you look around and you go where is it you you haven't made uh big purchases and that's the easier thing to see if you can see a big purchase and you go okay well this is the year that we bought the couch or the TV or something like that what do you do with it now uh-huh right but all those you know just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries and stuff that you don't have tangible i mean the perishable kind of things that's gone used and gone oh yeah yeah it's it's amazing how much we spend on some things my husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work oh and that's all he has he has a ten dollar bill huh and i mean so i'd say at least two usually three times a week he takes his lunch uh-huh the other times he'll uh i don't know go out somewhere eat in a cafeteria or whatever uh-huh uh-huh but but he keeps himself on that i mean he found it's it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch uh-huh that's a hundred dollars a month on lunch uh-huh that's that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch when he can take a sandwich you know yeah  so you have three cats three cats um i have a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian what type okay i'm trying to i don't know the first two the Himalayans a Bombay looks uh i guess the closest thing to describe it to is you have seen the caricatures of Halloween cats yeah of course that's that's what a Bombay looks like those the ones that always look like they're sort of scary okay yeah yeah that's what a Bombay looks like especially when they get skinny because they uh-huh is yours skinny or is it a tubby one yeah she's real skinny she's matter of fact she's uh she's down at the vet today she had her little operation so uh um-hum oh so she's young yeah she's fairly young we we've bred her once and and that's all we're going to breed her so uh uh-huh and how the kittens come out oh they're beautiful sold sold them all yeah are you keeping them sold them all uh-huh yeah she was going into heat again and uh she uh she hasn't been eating and just yeah you can't take you can't put up with that moaning very long oh it's awful you know oh i guess i've never been around a cat when it was in heat uh well you don't know what you're missing i'll probably be happy about it yeah uh my little prize is the little Himalayan Persian it's uh you know what a himmy a himmy is um-hum well a friend of mine i i don't remember what types they have but they're really really fuzzy yeah because i thought she had a Himalayan but i'm not sure um-hum yeah they yeah usually they're just called Himalayan this one goes more appropriately by Himalayan Persian because it doesn't have the coloration that a what people think of himmys they're usually more white with a little black they look like they look like off color Persians okay but this one is almost all black she's black and chocolate and silver hum she sounds really pretty she is she she's gorgeous she is four months old how old is she well she's just a tiny little thing they're adorable at that age too hum five and a half pounds she's uh laying right in front of my keyboard here on the desk right now wow does she like to sit on top of whatever you're reading and things like that oh yeah yeah i was in there trying to do some studying this afternoon and laying down on the sofa and she gets up on my chest where i can't see the book and then if i am in here on the computer she has to get up on the desk not on the keyboard my friend's cat gets on the keyboard you know oh yes she likes yeah she likes to she likes to type too it's even fun when i'm on CompuServe and i keep getting all these odd key strokes up there um-hum that come from her yes but she's a sweetheart i'm sorry i didn't mean to wake you up go back to sleep put more put more yeah put more cat hair in my disc drive right more peaceful my uh one set of friends have four cats and let's see these four cats two of them are sort of strays i guess um-hum and then the other two one of which i thought was a Himalayan and the other one i'm not sure but they're both so cute and they are like big fuzz balls and um-hum they're almost more like dogs one's name is Malcolm and he sort of follows you from room to room wherever you go and things like that so it's really really cute uh i love cats i don't know most people a lot of people don't like cats but i didn't until i watched my friend's cats i watched a different friends two cats one of them is really old the other one um also had been like a stray but he's huge and we think part um-hum Angora he's he's black Angora could that be i don't yeah long hair long haired yeah and yeah probably Angora there they're large cat yeah he was a real wild one yeah and uh but he was fun one time i was cooking chicken and i make taken all the chicken breasts off the bones and i had this whole stack of nice chicken breasts up there and he jumped from the floor probably about four and a half feet high and grabbed one of them off and devoured it before i could get near him yeah that sounds that sounds like Kitty Cat our our Bombay she's very athletic um being tall and skinny she can do all kinds of she's very versatile with her paws she's almost like a monkey she even eats with her paws really wow yeah she'll she'll dip her food or her paw down into the food and scoop up some and eat it from her paw have you ever taken videos of her or something that must be fun no we're going to uh we're going to catch her doing some some of the funnier things and she's also a retriever the only thing she likes to play with is crumpled cigarette packs so i crumble up a cigarette pack and i throw it and she'll go get it and bring it back to me it's just like having a dog huh she loves to play fetch and it doesn't matter where i throw it she can get it i've i've thrown it under under the refrigerator and she'll get down there and stick that long skinny paw in there she's very versatile um-hum maybe she likes the smell of it i don't know i i think she just likes the noise because if i want if i want to find her anywhere in the house all i have to do is crumble a package and she will come running that's amazing that's really cute yeah she yeah she's she's a sort of a weird one why don't you go back to sleep uh she's up playing now now she can maybe she'll type something that you need for you and then you'll be in good shape like a paper no now she's now she's just she's just rearranging all my papers for me she's playing with the pen uh-huh why don't you play with the keyboard oh when i had the uh cats at my place as soon as i took out the newspaper to read it they would plop right down on top of it and just not move and just stay there forever uh-huh oh yeah well Sheba Sheba the himmy loves to play with the paper she uh she gets she likes to crawl inside of it and she thinks she's hiding and nobody can see her and uh she'll jump all over it and tear it to shreds she's something she she's a stubby little thing she's big for her age she got little short legs and great big paws and she's not she's not athletic like Kitty Cat i mean the two of them these two are the favorite playmates the Turkish Van sort of sits off by itself but they love to play and uh um-hum Sheba has the weight advantage because she's heavier she would just sit on the other one oh when i first got her i mean Sheba was just a little tiny thing got her at ten weeks and and Kitty Cat took it upon herself to train her and she and Kitty Cat would jump all over her and beat her up and all you'll hear is Sheba you know all the time well now she's bigger than Kitty Cat and she's giving Kitty Cat some payback she be she gets back at kitty cat for all the hassle that's right Kitty Cat they'll be playing and Kitty Cat will jump on her and Sheba will just turn around and throw her to the floor get on top of her and you can't do that this week she'll have stitches leave her alone oh have you always had cats did yo u have them when you were a kid um-hum yeah ever since i was a kid my brother was asthmatic and so we never had pets in the house we had a dog for a little bit of the time and then but that time i never really liked cats you know i always thought cats were loose and sort of the typical um-hum thing you say about cats you know they don't they don't they're not people animals and things like that and i favored dogs a lot but dogs are just too impractical to have at all um-hum um-hum yeah well especially where you are oh yeah it's impossible people have them and they're out walking them on the street but i don't think it's fair to the animals no not not for dogs especially some of the breeds they've got and some of those you know need to be outside and have places where they can run and all that that's why i like cats so much better they're easy to take care of yeah do you let your cats outside no no not these these are these are all purebred um-hum are you afraid they'd get stolen or run away or oh yeah uh stolen run away no i doubt it but i don't want them breeding with any well that's for sure but yeah with any any weird strange cat around here um-hum we're going to be looking for a stud for this one pretty soon how old is she again she's uh four months right now you breed them that young i mean like in a year or well no well no we have but you have to line up a stud several months in advance she'll be going into heat probably around uh July or August i see but you breed them the first time they go into heat yeah well yeah you get your best litter is usually your first one really wow that's amazing because i would have thought that it would be better to wait a little bit nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat um-hum but but when they first go into heat uh that's the time when you want to breed them especially the purebreds we'll find you a nice handsome stud are you going to try and breed her several times or you'll see how the first breeding goes or uh probably just twice uh-huh just twice for her and we're going to end up probably keeping one out of each litter how expensive are you know thoroughbred cats to get um not too awfully uh uh Sheba Sheba cost us uh two hundred dollars you that's not that bad but you certainly want to protect them after that oh yeah i mean the the stud fee is worse i mean we're going to be paying probably three to four hundred dollars for a stud wow and how much can you sell the litter for you know the same type of price if they're good or um-hum uh we're going to breed her with a champion so we'll be able to get uh probably around two fifty for the kittens um-hum and how much uh how many kittens do they normally have in the litter her first one will probably be about four um-hum  okay okay exercise is something that i don't do enough of and i have an incredible uh setup at home that i that i have available to me that i should use and um in fact i'm trying to get back into it this week i have a treadmill a treadmill and uh yeah a a exercise bicycle plus a dog i could go walk and a whole lot of things like that well it sounds like you're you have the stuff there i have the stuff there i don't have the motivation all the time yeah well well i uh go to aerobics twice a week which i started a little over a year ago so how about you oh that's good and i i think that's probably pretty good for me um i part of my incentive when i started was to try to lose a few pounds because i had a special reason you know i wanted to and had a lot of motivation which um-hum um-hum and i did but then you know i just gradually come back up a few pounds anyway which is no big deal i'm not um-hum over weight or anything but you know how you always want to lose a few and yeah uh never happy i've found that now i i think if i didn't do the aerobics then i'd probably have to do something else because i'd probably gain weight you know because i yeah that's the one thing about if you exercise enough or or even a a a moderate amount you don't really have to be that concerned about your diet if you just eat normally and then don't over eat but you can yeah because if you don't exercise then it seems like um what you you just have to be really really careful about what you eat you can you can eat like a normal person if you get a moderate amount of exercise and not really have to worry about it yeah well i've never paid a whole lot of attention to my diet but but really you know i feel guilty all the time because oh i shouldn't be eating that well you must you must not have a weight problem at all not really uh i mean i would just like to be you know five or six pounds thinner but i don't consider that to be that big a deal yeah that no no but how often do you go to aerobics twice a week you do and you've been pretty faithful about that yes uh in fact i probably haven't missed more than five or six times in as i say about a year and three months and that's for an hour each time you go well that's that's good uh-huh yeah i i think it's you know at first it it was kind of a drag because i was not used to doing that much of anything and um that's really good i had been going to school and doing a lot of just you know sitting and studying and and really not working out at all but uh um-hum um-hum now as long as i keep going it's it's not that difficult to do and i can see where you know different muscles and things are in better shape oh my muscles are horrible that's the main reason i really ought to be doing something like that because mine's not so so much uh weight i mean i have i i if i had lost if i lost ten pounds i'd think of myself as nice and thin but uh most of it is just you know it's just in bad shape yeah so but i it was i i know how i felt so tired last week and yesterday was for the first time in in a quite a while i took my dog for a walk and it was incredible how much more energy and how much better i felt last night oh really so uh you know if if uh if if you can just remember even though you don't i don't particularly enjoy it at the time the benefits are just yeah uh just in you know far far out weigh the yeah there's sometimes sometimes sometimes when i go to aerobics and i get all hot you know it's too warm in this place where we go and everything and i'm thinking why am i doing this um-hum but like i say it just kind of becomes a habit and it's if if you don't break that cycle very often then you keep doing it um-hum well it sounds like you're you're uh you know got it got it well in hand i i just i go great guns for a few weeks and then i something something something happens that disrupts my schedule and then i just find excuses and the next thing you know you're not doing anything yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to drive up there um if i had to go you know several miles if it took me ten or fifteen or twenty minutes each way i probably would quit doing it do you go right after work no uh in fact that's kind of uh one of the things that's uh funny about it is i go at eight o'clock at night really yeah and you'd think well who wants to get up and go then but um it's really not been that much of a problem um-hum so it's during the week yeah you go during the week yeah well my husband and i were also doing quite a bit of walking but we got off of that a little bit uh mostly you know with the winter months and all it um-hum seems like there are too many reasons that you can't go because of the weather and things and does he go to have an exercise program too not really and he needs to but uh he's a CPA so at the moment he's snowed under until after tax season but i'm definitely going to get him back on something because he has a few oh kind of nagging health things that i think you know some more exercise would help um-hum so yours is a class an aerobics class that you go to yeah yeah but some men i guess are not too comfortable doing that but yeah we've had a couple of them in the class and oh uh they've kind of stuck with it one of them though has been coming with his girlfriend and they're about to get married in a couple of weeks so it might be interesting to see if they stick with it but um i also swim quite a bit in the summer time gosh you work you sound like my sister i have a sister in Nevada who who is really into i mean she's very athletic anyway she always has been she was the athletic person in the family and she swims and she you know cross country skis and does all this stuff it sounds like you sound like the same type well i'm not gung ho you know i but i'm not opposed to any of of you know kinds of things i just don't do a lot of them um-hum um-hum um-hum you know it's tough to to work everything in that you want to accomplish and i have a lot of other interests yeah well uh it's too bad we can't talk about your other interests but we just have to talk about exercise so well keep up the good work and i'm going to i'm going to well well you'll have to start working on your machines because that's nice that you have those things well i told a friend of mine whose got a real she really does have a weight problem i said well i have an exercise bike that's sitting over here that's collecting dust and i i have my treadmill and i have a rowing machine and a trampoline i said i'll come over this afternoon and you can borrow the the exercise the exercise bicycle at least maybe it'll get some use so um you know we're going to try to she's got yeah about fifty pounds that she needs to lose so uh you know even though that sounds that's bad it it may be easier for her to lose that for me to lose ten then for me to lose ten yeah so i'm i'm going to you know try to help her and that will kind of help to get me you know make me want to do things too so yeah yeah that might be good i have a a friend who uh needed to lose a lot of weight and she and uh another friend of hers decided to start walking and they were doing i don't know several miles each night and boy she really got the weight off yeah really really yeah kind of kind of having a a a buddy or somebody to kind of stir you on and and you know keep your motivation level up too i think sometimes might help so i was thinking maybe your husband would you know maybe the two of y'all i mean if he had come on let's go or you you know and y'all kind of did it together in a way that helps well yeah yeah it it helps a lot with the walking because otherwise it's just plain boring um-hum uh to me at least i don't like to go out by myself but that's when we do the most talking and you know about things that have taken place during the day and that's yeah all sorts of things that i don't think you know we typically do we don't take that much time to talk um-hum well maybe if the with the weather getting so nice and so yeah after you come home from aerobics make him go for a walk with you while you cool down well i enjoyed talking to you all right bye-bye well you too bye-bye  well how about you are you an exercise fanatic no i'm definitely now i do like to walk no me either do you yes since TI has uh uh instituted that um uh walkabout i have gone out and started walking even more bought me the you know the proper proper shoes and everything to get started and uh park out there you know way out there in the boondocks yeah wonderful uh-huh and it was so funny the other day i took some guys to to lunch and when we came back they said oh there's a parking space real close and i parked way out in the boonies and i said you can walk off your lunch way that's the way to do it yeah i'm kind of like you i've never really gotten into it it's just a it's just a chore you know and i finally decided one semester i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and um um i still don't have any of my PE classes and so one semester i thought okay that's what i'm going to do and that will get me where i'll have to do it you know oh uh-huh and they were offering a a walking class where you you know you have to walk you know that like for every mile you walk and every so many minutes you get you get points you know and then you have to go in once a week and log your points so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want you know um um um um and at the end of the semester you go back in and your like your final exam is a three mile walk and if you walk it in this many minutes you get an A this many minutes you get a B oh uh-huh and i thought oh this will be an easy class and you know and i did it and i did it for a long time like about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot and this has been a couple of years ago well oh no uh-huh and you know i had i did that and i just ended up having to drop the class you know by the time the final came around i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet let alone walk three miles you know oh oh no yeah but that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it um um because then i had to i had to go every week and log in what i had walked and my teacher looked at it every week and it was you know right uh-huh but other than that i just you know i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile say okay i'm going to start going to aerobics now you know and and i'll go for like two weeks and go this is for the uh-huh there you go birds you know this is too much work well you know i have noticed too that uh uh when i started the exercise uh not the exercise but the walking program uh that i did tone up you know like all over but it didn't get the upper part of my body and uh so uh-huh uh-huh what i do is i bowl i am a fanatic when it comes to bowling and i used to bowl five times a week so i really loved it and i still bowl at least once a week now on a league on on a and i'm bowling on the TI league wow yeah uh uh-huh um but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor so that every time i get up to bowl i have to bend over to pick up my towel and that way i get the little extra exercise uh-huh i'm always explaining to people i do little things like that like you know take the stairs instead of the um the elevator and yeah and i do silly things like that versus a a regular program that you would have but that's you're amazed at how much that adds up i was on uh Nutri Systems for a while and that is one of the things that they really stressed doing you know it sure does uh-huh when you come to your Nutri System meeting don't park in the parking place outside the front door park at the other end you know i mean and they stretched stressed things like that too you know during when you're sitting in sitting watching TV at night yeah right uh-huh during every commercial get up off the couch there you go go to the living room and get a glass of water go to the bedroom and make the bed go do something uh-huh um-hum um-hum but get up during every commercial and things like that and you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up you know just gives you a little more activity so uh-huh that's true that's true yeah especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway you know hum-um no i used to i really did uh years ago and uh i was thinking about that not too long ago that really i used to walk and not only did i walk but i used to watch all those exercise programs on TV and i would tape them yeah and then i would do them like two times a day but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside well i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before i had mine either so i've never been i just i'm more into you know sitting than i am yeah yeah me too so but you know i have found that with i have a two year old and i have found really though i'm kind of the opposite i'm more active now with him than i was before uh-huh yeah because now you know he'll i want to go outside and i'll go outside with him and we'll walk up and down the street and we'll go to the park and i'll run around with him and stuff like that that so i'm getting more you know more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him you know so um-hum um-hum i think i think that has helped a little bit i don't know yeah yeah running just chasing him around the house you know will be plenty for you oh yeah that's that's enough well mine are older now doing uh their own things so right right you've kind of gotten out of that little stage there oh yes yes i have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old so yeah yes oh lucky you you're getting into even more interesting stages hm yeah yeah see we're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager uh-huh yeah yeah same thing huh it repeats repeats yeah you watch it'll be exactly the same the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen it does it does it it absolutely does so how interesting i can hardly wait yeah i i i know i just know you can't but no i don't get as much exercise as i used to but i at least since TI has implemented that program i do i'm more aware of it yeah and you know that i'm need to do this that and the other and uh so i try to do combinations of things but not like go down to the President's Health Club like i see all these people do right that that walkabout's a good program it really is you know when they first started it i i got all the information of course it is it is but just like everything else i was real gung ho with a friend of mine oh we're going to do this we're going to do this and we did do it for a long time yeah and then i started school you know and like two nights a week i was going to school and then the other two nights a week my husband worked so i had to pick Ryan up you know there's always an excuse you know to to not do it so um um oh yeah oh yeah and it gets worse it doesn't get any better yeah oh and i'm sure i'm sure yeah because i'm constantly running my children around someplace and that's where i actually get my exercise yeah is running them from here to there in the car here to there and here to yeah yeah to the mall to the movies to the friends to the there you go that's it that's it sounds like fun well it was really good to talk to you well it was nice talking to you yeah well okay we'll talk to you later um um bye-bye take care okay bye bye  well what's your favorite dish oh for your question probably it's uh tough to decide between like some sort of a Chinese dish or something like pizza yeah yeah i understand that i like oriental cooking and uh pasta and i have the same problem uh um-hum Italian heritage so i definitely like pasta but i like Italian and the two don't mix though i've tried that that doesn't no no although you can make a sort of a Chinese pizza yeah that doesn't work very well either uh i don't know sort of dumb what kind of food would you have in a dinner party well it depends on what kind of people you got coming over so we'll leave it at that sure uh let me see what do you what you like to cook uh just everything or do you have specialties i'm i pretty much specialize i guess in uh Italian and Chinese um i'm a vegetarian yeah as uh Chinese gives me a lot of room to play with i've been i've been doing some stuff with um Middle Eastern lately you know cooking up dals and stuff which has been fun yeah um-hum um-hum yeah i um i i've been collecting recipes and modifying recipes for a long long time um-hum and uh i run a little direct mail business on the side and i finally put together a cookbook wow and uh i've got to i got to reformat it i i did it on my word processor and now i've got to redo the whole thing again and i'm trying to figure out a cheap way to a quick way to do it without having to retype it um-hum because uh it's it's all size about it's not it's not very big i mean it's like a hundred and five pages something like that um-hum but it's got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just for fun um-hum yeah yeah i usually um you know i get Usenet so i usually just uh look at the recipe groups in there uh for interesting things um-hum well see what else can we talk about food well what sort of cookbooks do you um do you usually use well usually hardly any at all anymore um i've i've gotten together sort of like basic recipes yeah um-hum and once you have those you can add to them or take away from them and come up with all kinds of different dishes that's true i i have several cookbooks uh Betty Crocker and New York Times and a couple of Japanese cookbooks a couple of Chinese cookbooks i even got a Filipino cookbook um um-hum hm they have a nice dish in there for a chicken dish i forgot the name of it but it takes a special kind of sausage and you can only get it at Filipino stores well that's interesting yeah and it's it's a it's a strange sort of it's sort of like a pepperoni um-hum but it's it has a much sharper flavor and it's uh it's almost like it has red dye in it or something when you cook it it bleeds and it colors the food hm it's pretty interesting but it's a real good chicken dish it's sort of like a chicken potpie in a way you have a crust on top and all that um-hum um-hum delicious though i love it do you yeah i pretty much i i guess i stick pretty much i got a couple of Moosewood books some yeah The Greens i find to be very handy yeah um other than that i mean i you know i got five or six others that i can i can look up for inspiration or something i don't know but uh yeah but yeah an idea yeah that's the way i am i generally get there and right i have a have an idea of what i wanna do i don't really know how to get started so i i look at something get me get me ah yeah well i'll add this to it and do this and turns out pretty good sometimes right um-hum yeah i find it's usually pretty useful to cook you know some number of recipes out of a book to get a flavor of the style yeah and then from that point you can pretty much improvise once you once you understand the spicing patterns and stuff like that yeah well i mean i mean that's yeah that's the fun of cooking improvising right absolutely if you're gonna sit there and just follow a recipe that's no fun um-hum you know i agree you know a monkey can do that um-hum i bet even my cats could do that no not this one she's dead to the world right now oh well well let's see i guess that's about it on food yeah okay all right good talking to you Brad take care bye nice talking to you bye  okay so who is your favorite football team guess i bet you can't guess well i would say the Saints after you got it and i want to tell you something what's that they're going to go somewhere pretty shortly yeah yeah i think they are because they're getting better every year yeah and uh they got a lot can't call them the New Orleans Saints any more i don't think so no we went to the play-offs yeah yeah well i'm a i'm a Buffalo Bills fan yeah now i like them too from a from a long time ago so it's good to it's good to see the Bills doing so well now and they are they are doing a whole bunch better who's their quarterback yeah what's that who's their quarterback uh Jim Kelly yeah yeah i like to watch them too they're the i like to watch almost all the football but um of course i watch every Saints game that i can watch uh-huh but i think they're going to i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together yeah if they would just quit blowing it well the it the the NFL draft really seems to be doing its job because got teams like like Buffalo who weren't certainly weren't a powerhouse uh ten years ago now they've been able to get some good players and come around and the New Orleans the same story and uh and uh a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse and then they uh they weren't getting the draft picks and now the uh other team so it seems to be uh moving around and uh to to New Orleans benefit and uh you see how look at the Cowboys now they're uh they're hurting yeah um-hum and uh really bad yeah but they got so much bad publicity too and i think that hurt a lot of you know people even wanting to play on their team well yeah well well well yeah uh firing firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson what what kind of uh uh doesn't give you much respect for their team at all any team any team that that where the owner would fire Tom Landry you know is like one of the greatest coaches of all time right right and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching yeah yeah because all the problems i mean if you think about those years that we had the losing season of how bad i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs because of uh right you know messing with young children and i mean it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other right and he always and uh had a lot of trouble with injuries too with them yeah you know he'd uh never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy and then even like uh what is it Eric Dickerson left the team you know that you're right you know like people were jumping ship right and left um-hum right and i don't know that sounds to to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem but then the team was sold yeah so but uh that Jimmy Johnson came in too though and he just you know when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided you know this is the way it's going to be and it was bad yeah i mean it really was to me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild because everything everything i mean anything that Tom Landry wanted or had he was going to change it right i mean it's that i mean you know that's the way i felt about it but i tell you what if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback ain't nobody going to beat us well yeah in fact nobody going to beat us then because look how good we did without a quarterback this year i know who was the quarterback see i can't even think of who the New Orleans quarterback is well they had quite a few quarterbacks if you think about it uh Arcade was for a while and then um i can't remember that guy's name the one that held out for the money and he was across the river uh i can't think of the i can't think of his name now but really we didn't have a quarterback that was the whole problem we had one guy that couldn't throw and we had one guy that couldn't run yeah huh and it was it was just bedlam we really didn't have a quarterback it was uh defense winning winning winning all the games did they were they able to draft anybody this year i don't know because you know they gave away a lot of their drafts uh-huh for different people for you know other places right so i don't know i hadn't heard you know whether they have a new one or not well when is the NFL draft hasn't has the NFL draft even gone yet but uh huh-uh not yet but i mean i don't know whether they have one of the first you know choices of somebody that would be real good right right well they've yeah they've i mean yeah everybody gets in draft sure but i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good right but uh or even making the play-offs so that doesn't doesn't help you in the draft right but we really i mean really and truly we just don't have a quarterback yeah yeah that's all there is to it but the players and stuff they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too because we had some you remember when Archie Manning was a quarterback um-hum that was a few years ago yeah well he was good but we every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad uh-huh and of course we had a different coach then too but they'd treat him bad and then he'd leave um-hum or either they'd trade him off to somebody else for two of these nobodies right and it was weird it was like they were trying if you were good boy let's don't have you on our team you know but um this year they had all good players except for the quarterback yeah the quarterback all of them every one that they played i think they played uh i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks but all of them were bad i mean they were terrible they could not pitch you know they couldn't even take hand-offs it was terrible hum right but um all the other places i mean our defense was unbelievable oh that's one it's one thing yeah Buffalo's lucky though to have uh Jim Kelly then now he's the number one rated quarterback in the NFL i think i'm pretty sure he was this past season and uh did you get to watch any of their games yeah then with uh uh the defense with Bruce Smith Bruce Smith there at linebacker there they've got a very well rounded team and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they problems they had in the past and now they're uh really playing as a good good together as a team yeah so um do you watch it every Sunday uh when i can i'm a i'm a musician and uh the band i play in uh i this is just something on the side and uh the band i play in we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays so i missed a lot of Sundays during um did you ever get to watch any of the uh New Orleans games this actually i i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the New Orleans games per say New Orleans just isn't isn't one of the areas i've lived in so many places i've lived in uh i'm a Denver but i don't like the Broncos there's um no love for the Broncos but i've lived in uh no uh i was born in Buffalo and i lived in uh outside of Boston for five years and then my family lives in Philadelphia now and uh so i tend to look for uh uh and i lived in Detroit too so i like uh first of all first and foremost the Bills games i want to see and then i'll uh normally check out the Eagles or the Patriots and Patriots were so depressing this last year that teams in your area i know it yeah that uh i kind of gave up on them yeah but uh first and foremost the Bills i even went i went to got to go to a Bills game this year which was fun it was the the Bills Eagles game which appropriately enough oh that's neat fortunately the Bills won yeah and it was good weather yes we beat Buffalo in in and was it third of December oh my goodness and it was sunny and forty five degrees so we couldn't have done much better than that in Buffalo no because usually it's snowing ice and rain and everything yeah sure but i tell you what if you get to watch some of these now i don't know how it will be this year you know but i mean these games go right down to the wire uh-huh it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair you know going oh no no and one uh i can't remember it was about uh it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the play-offs or not uh-huh so we're watching the game all right the other team got the ball and we had like no we got the ball back that's the way it was and they had to kick and uh to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us um-hum so we had to sit there you know and they cut the show off and showing started showing us another football game we did not get to see the end of the game you talk about people calling in it was wild i mean here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair you know and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another you know one that was going on oh my gosh sure and then they changed the game right cut us off right there the last few seconds the station finally you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom started telling everybody that they were not the ones that had cut that off that it was the national you know right right it was the network uh-huh and because it was funny i mean everybody was furious i was so mad i got up and went and called you know i couldn't believe that but almost every game that i watched it would come right down to the end we would be ahead you know but then at the very in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or you know right ahead of them right and it'd come right down to the end and either we made it or we didn't oh and it was it was something else i said this is the most if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl yeah there's no question about it because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything yeah well that's the that's the guy that counts yes but maybe we maybe we'll get your guy well i i don't think Jim Kelly is about to be swayed away from the Bills any time  okay uh i think maybe that we could do better with the budget if we didn't buy so much stuff overseas well i don't know how much that would do for the budget though i mean that has helped the economy as a whole you know American jobs and all but well then maybe they wouldn't have to take so many taxes out and stuff like that well yeah if we bought more American stuff i guess that's more American taxes well i guess you know it's like your own home budget you know you can either earn more money or you can uh spend less and you know just like you and i have to make choices like that i think the government has to do it too well i agree i think that's what i'm trying to say yeah the question is which which excuse me that's my little girl which one should they do spend less i think we well i think we give too much money away to other countries yeah to other countries we don't ever get anything from anybody when we're having to fight to get money to help us with this war we were just in well that's that's the that's because we're supposed to be the rich ones with all the money to give away right well it's not true though we're not anymore we're still we are still the biggest ones as you know as far as how much money we've got in the whole country we're still bigger than anybody else we can't even take care of the people that are hungry and homeless here yeah that's that's an important thing we've got we've got a lot of people who are getting money the from the government for this that and the other thing uh i mean and uh it would probably help if we could figure out how to get them to put money back into the system instead you know you take someone on welfare and you give them a job and they're paying income taxes all of a sudden you've changed it around and it's going in the other direction but see right right now we're having a hard time finding people jobs yeah if you're a TI worker you how well you know are you are you a TI worker yeah so am i so we know you know that times are really tough right now and yet we're still sending money here and there i just know it yes i am um-hum you know it's just crazy yeah and more and more people without i have several friends without jobs now that in this last riff went out looking for jobs and jobs are really hard to come by now really hard to come by yeah yeah that's what i don't understand and that's scary yeah you wonder you know when is it going to happen to me that's right it's already happened to me once but i was lucky yeah um-hum and i got to stay in TI but you know not everybody's that lucky anymore yeah and they're and i don't know the welfare system is just so abused well i i i don't think the problem so much is abuse i think the problem is is just the government is trying to do too much um i mean who where does it say that the government's supposed to be the one to take care of all of the people that are homeless or hungry or et cetera et cetera and and where does it say that that if someone is short that they can go to the government and and get a handout well i know but then okay but that's here but then other countries are doing it to us yeah their when their people are hungry and all they're asking us for handouts so why shouldn't our own people be able to ask for a handout um-hum yeah i mean i think we should take care of our own things right here in our own country and then if we have anything left over to share with other countries then maybe we should consider sharing um-hum but i just don't i think we're and then they keep raising the taxes boy i'll tell you what i barely make ends meet and they raise taxes and uh-huh wages aren't going up that much and it's hard no they're not yeah i mean you know especially if you're alone it's on one salary it's terribly hard to pay the bills and pay your house payment and a car payment and insurance is ridiculous yeah yeah you know and you know i think you know i've got a fairly decent job here at TI but uh when i think of you you go to the the grocery store and you see someone working as a cashier and you think you you know how much a cashier makes and you go how do these people get by not very much they because i know how hard it is for me to get by yep it's hard it's really hard i yeah well uh no i don't know i guess if we had the answers we'd we could save the country but we could go run for office yeah well they all say great things when they run for office um-hum well the thing is um you know who's really in charge of deciding how the money gets spent and and it's you know it's not the president the president just suggests it the ones who actually you know debate it and decide it is the is the Congress and you know what the Congress is out for they're they're going to do whatever it takes to make their voters happy which means bring more jobs and more federal spending to their little area and uh uh and that means every Congressman is sitting there working for money going to his area nobody's working on less money going to his area or on anybody else's area and if you just if you just looked at how much Congress spends on itself it's ridiculous yeah i know that you know and then they cut their defense i i'm not sure if that was such a great idea that cut us really bad i just i hated to see that well now the thing is yeah they're cutting defense which is you know there are people out there working for defense contractors who are losing money but i don't i don't mind because i think you know government is not there to give me a job Government the defense is there to defend our country and they do it for whatever you know they spend whatever money they need to to do that but i don't want them to to break the budget just so that i can have a job i would rather have the the government stable so that i can go get a good job with someone who's not working you know not making defense stuff well yeah yeah i do but i still hated to see it i mean one of the reasons i voted for Bush was because if you know what i mean yeah Reagan was so defense conscious and we were doing so well and i thought well Bush is going to just carry right on he didn't was i surprised i uh um-hum well he didn't have much choice really well i don't know yeah but but defense is not the biggest part of the federal budget either the biggest part of the budget are things like Medicare and Social Security and uh but those are things that we we really need i hate to see the old people that don't have anybody and hey you know there are people out there that have no family or and they really depend on their Medicare well um-hum yeah um-hum and their Social Security and maybe they're in a nursing home somewhere and they cut some of this stuff and what happens to them yeah yeah well you know how fast your TI medical insurance has been going up right yeah well just think the federal government's insurance bill has Medicare and that's been going through the roof and that's why federal you know that's that's the biggest increase in federal spending right there so what's the answer think we need to figure out a way to uh to make medical care cheaper why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast you know because it's it's coming out of my paycheck it's coming out of your paycheck and it's coming out of our taxes too yes yeah why why is these hospitals making so much money isn't it England that has it all state run or something oh there's a whole lot of countries in Europe that do that Sweden Denmark Norway but they what is it is it free to the people to people or how do they work that it's it's free for everybody in the state or the country everybody in the country like i i lived in Denmark for a couple of years uh-huh and medical care there is free you just go and say i want your help and they'll help you there's couple of things though first of all it's not as high a quality as we expect here because it's paid for by the government instead of by us and second um your taxes are a lot higher oh okay an awful lot higher we're talking fifty percent something like that so they are paying for it okay well the way i you know it was talked about they are paying for it and and the and the just the quality of care is not as good either well then that's not the answer there has got to be a middle ground i think Canada's got a good answer but i don't know many details about it yeah what do they do it's it's some sort of government program i've heard a lot of people say good things about it but i just don't know the details on it oh okay i don't know i don't know if anything will ever happen to to change change change things i i guess it's going to have to change well something's going to have to change but you look at the Congress and you look how many of them get reelected and they're the one's that have got to make the changes i mean i don't see anything changing because you've got the same old people in there and the other thing that concerns me terribly is automobile insurance now i don't know how much longer i'm going to be able to afford it at all yeah it's eating me alive because i i might be almost fifty but i'm single and i don't think and this company's that just because and i own my own home and i have a garage and because i'm single there's companies that won't take me no matter how old you are single yeah they won't take you because they say you're a risk you go out and party i said i don't even drink i mean i don't even go out but they won't take you i mean i was turned down this year hum by an agent who represented i'm not sure of the companies he represented but i was told because you're single they absolutely won't take you i said that is that's prejudicial that's terrible what's going to happen if they all start doing this um-hum yeah um-hum what's really terrible is they can do this to you you know and you don't really have that much of a choice as to whether or not you take it because the government government says if you're going to drive a car you've got to have the insurance but yet they're not helping us with the companies they're they're not helping you uh be able to afford the insurance that they're making you buy that's right  how are you tonight i'm fine are you a Native American yes so you are real so all the rest of us are um immigrants i guess why it's kind of interesting that they would do how do you feel about the idea of letting all these foreigners in it doesn't well to a point it's okay you know i don't mind i've never had a problem with them letting people in i just don't think that they they are right in some of the things they do well do you think there should be restrictions on uh who you should let in the states no because then you get to the problem of then then you're not a free country anymore okay well what about if somebody was um is sick say they have AIDS or something uh it doesn't matter everybody over here has got it anyway they're you know AIDS is AIDS as long as if they tell you before they come here that's fine you know that they got AIDS but then all you have to do is make sure they're not passing it around yeah but then they don't know how it really you know to me they don't know nothing about AIDS anyway so yeah that it it's really sad that uh but apparently they're they're i think there are some rules that won't let people in who have that's just a different you know my my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here on welfare or trying to make it and you know the united States gives people that come into the country more money to start their life than the people that's already here that's trying yeah this is that's the only fallback i see because i've seen like when the Vietnamese come over they get they have stores and you know Uncle Sam done bought uh uh you know Uncle Sam had to pay for it they gave them that loan but people over here can't even get a small business loan like that yeah it's harder for somebody from America to get a loan from their own country when a foreigner can get more and i don't think that's right yeah that that can really be a problem i know in in in New York there's a problem with the Koreans that uh that that the uh black community is complaining that the Koreans are taking over um-hum what is the yeah that and then you have well then you have the well no Mexicans they they don't take over too much they just they just make more money well i have a friend that's married to a in fact he went went to Korea and married a Korean and brought her home and uh um-hum that's a lot the problem was that that she is a real hard worker and has started a a couple of businesses and now she's started a Korean health food store and yeah she's really a go-getter that uh and she started off uh cleaning uh houses yeah and uh then she found out that these automobile dealerships needed and so she got some people to help her and she had one and then she was doing a good job and she wound up having uh eight or ten automobile dealerships yeah that she was cleaning and and apparently uh her her husband is sort of watching the money for her but apparently she's a really a hard worker and willing to do the hard work yeah and has been able and now she's made enough money to start this health food store i don't know how she's doing but it i guess you have to admire the people who have come in and work and don't you know don't take money from the government yeah now that's all right i don't mind people that work for what they do i give them a and if and if they work so hard and then get give them a small that's fine i just don't think that the handouts are equal yeah no it it it's also kind of okay that's what i'm saying there there's so much problem with the handouts and then now by the economy being like it is this is the worst time they could have for everybody coming into the United States well and the problem is that the jobs it's it's like the minimum wage everybody saying well i made the minimum wage but my son i have a seventeen year old son and he's saying well he'll go out and work at minimum wage well the problem is uh minimum wage is not enough to live on no it's not and if it's uh it's just like my husband well we was talking about it before he sold his truck he was a truck driver now for him to actually make money he would have to make almost nine dollars a hour that's just to live yeah okay but you can't find no jobs like that no you don't and and and that's what i think is so sad about the whole uh proposition and if you've got all these people who come and work for for nothing and uh okay for nothing that's where you problem comes in is because some people will work for nothing when other people won't yeah and then that's why you have your i think that's where the the the line is even in Japan in Japan though it's the same way they have their their economy is booming because of the United States if you don't understand that and i i i sit and i think about it but the the car the car market over the the automobile industry you know it's been the United States for so long and the last yeah fifteen twenty years the Japanese have just taken over yeah why do you do you do you think that has any anything to do though with uh i think it has a lot to do with the price of a car and how much see to me they people don't look at it but if you take a Japanese car and bring it over here they sell it for the same amount of American car yeah okay if you take an American car and take it to Japan you can't even hardly you couldn't afford it what what about cars that are that so our our import tax on them is no big deal but their their tax on us and you can't you can't do that plus they can make it cheaper because they don't pay that much well what about the what about the fact that it is right across the border in Mexico the what is well you know i don't know if you know i don't i don't like the idea of the illegal aliens well but no i'm talking about the idea of the that the company set up uh factories right across the border Right across the Texas border in Mexico i don't oh that's just that's just so that the uh now see they made more money down there and they got real cheap labor in Mexico well you you you think you think that's worse than than having the Mexicans come across the border and work in the factory of the United States and take jobs away from Americans yeah i no i think it would be better if they would stay down there and get right papers to come across the border well but but what you think of the of of the big uh the big companies that uh that that set up factories in Mexico and basically move jobs out of the United States down to Mexico well there's a lot of companies TI do that TI got companies in Mexico i don't if it's in Mexico Mexico but they got them in in foreign countries yeah yeah it's in you know so but but anyway but but do you think but the thing is down if they put a factory down there that means that there's more jobs for those people so they're not crossing the border you as much but some of them are still crossing not because of i know a lot of times i don't think it's just because of the money i think it's because they don't they the the the country themselves you know like the government should i say because everybody's not free to do what they want to do in every country but but do you think do you think that's why there's so many people that want to come to the United States because of freedom or yeah do you think that's the main reason do you think the i think it's freedom and the and and to and the right to do what you want to do as opposed to well doing what the government wants you to do or been doing the government thinks you're able to do so it's the same thing yeah and the government forcing you or taking more of your money than you want to give them yeah because i can make a million dollars and i know exactly Uncle Sam can't take half my money they can take whatever the percentage is for that amount you know yeah that's it yeah but do you but the what about the do do you think that's fair for for people that come in here from say like the Koreans i know i know a lot of Koreans that's why um and and you think it's fair um-hum the only thing about a Korean or the or the Vietnamese that like i said i don't like is the idea like i said is i don't mind them because they can do anything they want to do and as long as they don't take jobs but see a lot of the jobs they're taking people don't realize nobody else wants well yeah we were yeah well we had uh we knew some Laotians and and uh the job they took uh you know basically are cleaning jobs you see what i'm saying um-hum and um of course there's a lot of money in cleaning you know if you get a good business going um-hum you know there's there's a lot of money to be made for cleaning but they um but see just like her Korean food store okay that's mostly for Koreans um-hum yes and that's just like over here on on on Walnut and uh Plano Road or is it Jupiter one of them streets anyway uh that whole section is nothing but but like Chinese or or Korean foreign i don't what it is yes yeah yeah it is and i find that uh okay and that's because they cater to their own people yeah which people don't realize it but there is a lot of them here and that way they can make money because they make money and then they put it right back into to somebody elses business and that that's interesting they would i was reading something that said that they way and and there that is wrong with America people don't put they money back into the same thing that's why Americans buy foreign if Americans would buy American cars we wouldn't have to worry about none of this yeah yeah what they were saying is that these uh people come in and they will uh they will uh live on say twenty percent of what they make and and they'll put four or five families in in one apartment yeah and uh and but see some people you can't do that to some apartments won't let you do that and then a lot of people you can't like i don't think i could live with my sister yeah well that's another thing okay families American families don't get along that good enough to stick together no but the idea though is well is if if you could put two or three families in a in a together they'd be a lot easier and apparently they all just save their money and and uh and buy a bunch of things that's right that's why now that works if you can find somebody to do it with but it's very rare that you can find somebody to do it with well most of us like our freedom you know we like to be left alone and we like uh um-hum you know we like to have our own room and you know you  okay hi i like uh i like i love to do uh all kinds of crafts and sewing i i find that's my one release um-hum what do you do um i like to do like physical things like sports uh-huh um i really enjoy softball and my favorite is volleyball uh-huh and but i'm at school i'm in you know i live i live up at the college uh-huh so sometimes it's hard for me to do that so i just like sometimes i like just to get away i go to my room and i like walk in turn the radio on or you know just kind of like veg out or something uh-huh well i have two small kids and so i i don't have you know much time to to go places and play sports you know i have to do something where i can do it at home and um-hum so i'm um i just love to sew and uh you know i make i make a lot of my Christmas presents and um-hum and i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that i like to do that stuff but when i'm in college like when i'm at school i don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it no i remember when i was in college i didn't have time to do that stuff either it was really yeah yeah but now you know i don't have a whole lot of time now but i have more time than i did so uh-huh and a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity you know for you know i've got two kids to put clothes on yeah exactly uh-huh like um well i have i come from a family of twelve children and oh when i'm up here i really miss my younger brothers and sisters so you know that's that's a change because there's nine of them that are younger than me uh-huh i'll call home like when i know my mom and dad aren't home i'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters i i really miss them a lot so i don't i guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too yeah i yeah i just uh have you know one brother and he's married and you know they have a couple kids so i you know i don't have uh you know i don't get on the phone too much but yeah most of my stuff is just going places you know i enjoy going places with my kids and i do like sports but i'm you know i don't have a lot of time for them my i like volleyball of all sports i think that would be my favorite because i hate basketball and yeah well i'm not much of a basketball fan either and yeah i enjoy playing volleyball but i you know i i don't have a lot of time to do it so it's maybe once a year or something and and then i uh-huh yeah you know used to play it a lot when i was in school but now that i'm married and stuff i you know i've like i'm really bad nobody would want me on their team i'm the you know i'm the opposing teams best player so so to speak so uh-huh but yeah i enjoy um you know just i you know i have varied interests and stuff and yeah um yeah not that i like reading but i do do a lot of reading while i'm here at school uh-huh do you like reading as a hobby uh i love to read but i you know i don't have a lot of time to read and yeah you know what reading i do i kind of do because it's you know it's the necessary stuff as far as fun reading you know i maybe get to read the Sunday paper but uh-huh that's about it you know so yeah but yeah i don't have a lot of time to read i yeah i remember in college i did a lot of reading most of it text books um-hum and just you know keeping busy with everything else going on so but yeah i i like to do uh i've made stuffed cows you know dress you know dolls like they're like dolls they uh-huh you know you make clothes for them and everything like that yeah they those have been real popular with my family i've had them calling up and saying will you make me another one and so i do things like that you know if i had more time i'd probably do it and sell the stuff but you know i don't have enough time to do it to really you know take orders on it and um-hum yeah you know it's like i can only do it when i have time i have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is so do you um i know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college and i make them also is the padded covered photo albums oh yeah uh-huh yeah i do i've done those too before yeah uh-huh those are real i have a several of those that i've made like as wedding gifts you know i made them out of all lace and uh-huh and satin you know and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that so yeah those are real popular in fact i got some of those for my wedding so uh-huh i know they're real popular here at school also yeah uh-huh yeah yeah those are fun to do and just little things you know i i didn't have a lot of when i was in college i did you know i did sewing for other people when i had time you know like if somebody needed a bridesmaids maids dress made i'd make that but that's about all the sewing i did i never had time for you know to sew myself a new dress or anything like that so but um-hum yeah i just kind of sew for my kids and that's about it so well i guess maybe we've covered covered the topic pretty good yeah i really don't have any other yeah i'm not too much uh you know i don't have a lot of hobbies mine are just mostly you know things i just do out of necessity uh-huh okay well it's been nice talking to you good luck in school bye bye it was nice talking to you too thanks bye bye  okay all set do you want to start i can go ahead and start uh sure go ahead in Dallas there's definitely a crime problem i know it's you know worse in the larger cities um it's kind of a concern for me in fact at the moment i'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment and uh it's i am single and female you definitely are going to worry about the location and uh oh God you know accessibility of people to be able to break in i live on a third floor now but i you know i'm real concerned that i i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that and do they have many buildings that have security there the um some buildings do it depends on the location the area i live in right now is is real good as far as crime rate is concerned and we don't have anything at all no burglar alarms no guards some some places do have guard gates that you have to get through or electronic access gates and things like that yeah yeah well i i went to Dallas um when i worked for TI in Abilene and uh i i'm a little familiar with the city area Forest Lane and you know through that off off the freeway um-hum um-hum and uh it didn't seem like it was that congested in that that part you know because to me where we live out here in the north east it it's there are a lot of buildings very close to each other um-hum um-hum and the cities are very populated with tenement housing um-hum where there are more than one family in a house um and with with the uh people that are coming into the country from other countries not knowing the language and uh they're they're going to the big cities it makes it very difficult um-hum it really does and and i i've seen the same thing that you're talking about uh much more crime than ever before drugs of course uh a big part of it i think um-hum um-hum and uh i don't know a lot of younger people you know into more violent crimes oh yeah yeah that that that's really sad you know you got young boys or girls that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and no remorse what so ever um-hum there's a lot of that going on in Dallas too yeah yeah it's really sad it is and and i don't know if it's uh the family you know thing where they're not bonding anymore where mothers are working all the time and um-hum the kids aren't getting the attention that they need or the television um-hum and i i really think that we're we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people oh i agree i think that people are getting off too easy they're getting they're getting paroled too easily they're just getting uh put on probation or something because the prisons don't have enough room so they get they get i uh yeah they get lighter sentences and some of those people they don't deserve to be let loose yeah exactly and and you know they had uh in fact on the news last night we were watching this uh man who lost his ten year old daughter he ran out to the store for a few minutes and he had left her home alone she now ten years old she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes you know oh yeah and while he was gone he had looked went looking for a job and stopped at the store that's what it was and uh someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets these two men went in raped the girl murdered her oh my gosh and the whole bit and one of the men got uh i think it was seventeen years and the other one was in for uh life imprisonment um-hum the one that was in for the seventeen years actually served seven and he's out uh that's terrible but and the man said that you know if if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail that he would eliminate this person himself and then go to McDonald's and have a hamburger and not thing a thing think a thing about it um-hum yeah and i mean i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands yeah and that innocent people i i shouldn't say innocent because i mean actually actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances but um-hum the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it you know it's like two different things yeah sometimes when you lose someone that you really love you do some crazy things right it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess i don't know i i like the idea that uh if someone is from a foreign country um-hum and they come to this country and uh commit a crime i think that irregardless of whether they have already become a citizen or anything they should be immediately deported um-hum especially if they're found guilty of the crime um-hum you know once they they have been arrested and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt these people are guilty that's it we don't take care of them we don't support them um-hum um-hum nothing i mean they go right back where they came from right we have enough enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is so let let their country take care of it we don't have i guess too much trouble in Dallas with well i guess i guess we do have a lot of people come in from Mexico exactly and that cause problems but uh but that's uh they're they're so close i i don't consider Mexican people in the same category with uh especially like uh people who come from cultures that don't have the same uh kind of moral upbringing that we have yeah um-hum like you take Asian countries or uh the Eastern countries where women are like in the foreground uh in the background and the men are in the foreground and it's like you know um they live back in where where we came from two hundred years ago you know we've we've advanced beyond that um-hum um-hum um-hum and i think that their uh mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing you know what i mean um-hum it was amazing i went to the Far East uh back in October to do some training for TI and i uh it's uh-huh some of those countries were so safe it was unreal Singapore is very supposed to be very safe and in fact Tokyo and i thought Tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people yeah but they at at the TI there i said is there any area i should avoid and the guy said let me ask another girl here and he turned and asked this girl and said can you think o f any place where Dana shouldn't go by herself or anything and she she thought for a few minutes and she said no and he said is there any place you wouldn't go by yourself she said no and they said it is so safe there that you can leave your purse on the subway wow and somebody will turn it in and the and nothing will be missing they said they can just about guarantee that there uh that that would happen if you did that i thought boy in America if you left a purse on a subway you would never see it again wow you better believe it if you wouldn't even have to leave it i mean it would get snatched right off your arm yeah that's true that's true but i was thinking boy in Dallas if somebody asked me if there were places you wouldn't go by yourself at night i'd have to set them down for about five or ten minutes to list all the places out i mean oh sure i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place they said the crime apparently the crime is just uh that's amazing well what's what's the difference there do you know i'm not sure what it is there now i know what it is in Singapore is they have the death penalty and they really enforce it like for drugs oh i i believe in the death penalty i really do for drugs they they enforce the death penalty for that uh they're just very very tough and i guess maybe that's the way Tokyo is too or Japan is too they're just very tough on criminals yeah yeah i think that we're too easy uh and we take the the uh civil liberties uh stuff too far um-hum um-hum you know like people that are in prison i mean we didn't put them there they put themselves in that situation and as far as like them uh entertaining the rights that they should have um-hum oh yeah um-hum i mean we educate them we feed them we take care of them and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again uh-huh i'm not saying they're all bad but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes do not deserve to be cared for for the rest of their lives um-hum right i think that they should be put away and if they're overcrowded well you know they shouldn't have gotten theirself there in the first place get rid of them exactly i i really i i think that that's the whole key here this plea bargaining baloney um-hum where uh you know they plead to a lesser crime or uh they plead guilty in or you know tell about someone else and they they get less time um-hum or if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior they get for every year they're in they get so many less you know that they don't serve the full penalty um-hum i i i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this oh yeah i agree because it's not fair to those of us that that deserve a safe you know life to have to yeah same with drunk drivers right i think it's too easy for them um-hum that if the the laws and and uh were were harsher and were enforced um-hum i mean you have to set an example you have to start somewhere um-hum and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again um-hum an i and i feel bad for the policeman because he's out there every day facing these people um-hum right this this craziness you know people with uh automatic weapons and uh all this other stuff and trying to do a job and let's face it what do they get paid right not much twenty thousand dollars a year if they're lucky i wouldn't do it for that yeah hum-um and especially not in some of these big cities like in Dallas i mean they've had they're up in the top top five i think of cities that are getting policeman killed on on in the line of duty and that's really sad it is it really is and i mean they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything um-hum you know and uh i'm not saying that they're all good either because there's good and bad in everything but they they're already uh have strikes three strikes against them when they're out there um-hum um-hum because they'll arrest someone and you know go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this and having all kinds of evidence and you have to even be careful how you arrest them how you talk to them uh you know what they say right  okay what kind of car are you thinking about buying next well what a what what do we currently have i have a Subaru uh G O X T what year eighty eight oh okay well i have a ninety Honda Civic and i'm ready to get rid of it actually no well oh yeah it's not pretty old i had i had an eighty eight that i really liked then it got wrecked and so i bought a ninety um because i i really liked my eighty eight and i've had a lot of problems with this one so so you think their quality control's going down over there uh kind of well you it's it's kind of funny um i know a lot well i i i think we're going to see that i think uh that the quality that the Japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit while American carmakers are trying to get their butt together so oh yeah it's it's true it's definitely true because but but that's one reason i uh i've had no problems with my Subaru that's one reason i went with it because i Subaru had a good reputation uh for you know low maintenance so yeah well Honda does too that's why i was really well no there's there's no question but you have a nineteen i mean i've got to see i mean i've seen and i've had friends that have uh like uh eighty one or eighty uh Celicas uh-huh and those things just keep ticking i mean they just it can rack up a a hundred fifty K on them and they're still beating on them yeah that's true that's true and it's just amazing and i mean they got and you know they're not making them like that now you know so but they're still they're still a lot i think definitely better than the uh American carmaker and stuff no not at all oh i i definitely agree with you there because i had uh uh uh Ford T Bird before i got my Honda and it was the worst car i've ever owned and um that's why i mean i was so tickled with my Honda it was just a wonderful car and then it got wrecked yeah and you know i wouldn't even look at another car i just went and bought a Honda i mean i didn't even i didn't look around or anything i just said that this is what i want and i really have had a lot of problems with it but yeah well maybe you need to unload it on somebody else i don't know well i'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty but in the first twelve months that i owned it it was in the shop an average of about once a month it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months yeah it was i was really yeah that's a lot disappointed because i was you know so hyped up on Honda so yeah oh well anyway so what's your next purchase supposed to be well i know this oh really if you had a choice of your car what would you get well it's this is going to sound really strange but i really like to have a Mazda MPV van i really like those and i have kids so i'm not sure i'm real familiar with the body style on that they're a lot i don't like the new style like of the Toyota van and the the new Chevy Lumina van i don't like those styles um the MPV is more of uh uh just uh uh-huh that's um-hum i don't know what you normal i don't know how to explain more of an old fashioned type i i'm not sure how to explain it i mean it looks i guess kind of like uh the Chevy Aerostar or Arrow yeah yeah uh what Astro Astro i guess is what it something like that but i used to really like the looks of the MPV because it looks more like a minivan rather than i think oh okay yeah do you have uh do you have a family okay well that's probably influenced maybe a little bit yeah i have a couple kids so oh yeah definitely but i know that it's got to have a radio it's got to have air conditioning i'm sure you can relate to air conditioning oh yeah um living in Arizona but and cruise control and tinted windows that's about it i mean it's got to have those things otherwise i don't care yeah well when i bought my car it was right out of college and uh you know i always been looking for something sporty and i ended up getting you know basically something that i could you know afford um-hum the only gripe i have is performance i i probably uh a few girls that i've gone out with i've had uh like Mazda RX seven's and stuff and they're they're pretty fun to drive so yeah so i think that's what uh i i'm going to have to get next time around i keep i keep holding holding off i mean i could i could upgrade now if i wanted to but i just i it's just such a huge expense and oh really and uh i i'm just going to keep holding off but i'm definitely going to look for something uh in the you know nice performance you know yeah sports car i'd like to have a sports car too but it's not practical for me but yeah i'm in are you still there yeah whoops there's some kind of problems hello hello okay are you still there this is something's wrong i don't know it sounds funny though doesn't it wonder what happened hum anyway huh um but i'll probably um it just depends i know that's what i want but i don't know if i'll get myself to spend that kind of money you're looking at you know for a new RX seven or a Supra or something you're looking at twenty five K or something like that so oh at least yeah anyway but i know well new cars aren't cheap anyway but anyway my ultimate car though the the one that i really want is uh five sixty or so Mercedes so maybe someday huh yeah we have we all have those kind of dreams too don't we what i'd really like to have yeah that's the only one that i you know i see you know i see uh you know early on that that that says it says you there yeah this is strange hello okay hello i think something's wrong with this i hope it's recording i hope it's not my you there yeah it may be my phone um anyway it's the only car that says you know sporty and class uh so yeah you're right yep uh kind of what i'm but it's at the other one my brother's got a Miata and those are fun oh those are nice yeah they're they're cute cars and uh i yeah well he did he had a a red Miata uh-huh and uh he actually they came out with a European racing green uh Miata that's a limited edition they're only going to make like three or four thousand so he went out and he traded the other one in and got this one and i'm like um oh wow i haven't seen those but uh i haven't seen one yet either but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel so it's it's very authentic and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be may be a good investment wow oh yeah definitely if it's a limited edition usually no matter what it is if it's a limited edition it's usually worth something later on if it yeah uh-huh but uh i think huh hello yeah okay yeah i got off my pace or my cordless phone anyway uh hope it's not going bad it's going to bum me out um but he i think he he only spent you know the low twenties so oh really i don't know now see i would have never figured that i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition well i don't know i think the demands gone uh down a little bit i think you can the prices aren't as high you know and the the Miata Miata was first introduced uh and well they weren't really that bad though when they were introduced were they what yeah the demand is so high that uh you know they were going to retail them around like third you know thirteen standard you know and you get your options you're looking at fifteen or sixteen fifteen but there were you know people were buying them for nineteen and twenty yeah that's true um-hum and um they they may have gone down a little bit but i they're still pretty much in demand hum i think there's another car coming in it's supposed to come out and compete with that Miata and i can't remember what i read about that but so that's interesting i mean i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular so huh yeah it really is have you seen the new uh Dodge Stealth the the real nice one yeah yeah the Mitsubishi is real nice looking too now those are nice but oh yeah yeah and the Mitsubishi three thousand GT is the same same yeah well that's that's that's the same manufacturer and stuff so they just market them but uh yeah those are and those are supposed to be right right very performance power i mean they're there is yeah big time the expensive ones they have a cheaper model too that you can get for about seventeen thousand but those are pretty stripped and there's nothing there's really that one's just more for looks you know it doesn't have any really the performance that the expensive one does yeah you know but i've seen one of those and it's not that great i mean because they really i think they're they're only around uh twenty nine K yeah the like i mean they have um better it's not quite as nice for a little bit less yeah yeah they're not really that bad but i don't know like i said it's it's still not practical for me i have a hard time looking at cars like that because i think now there's no way i can do that yeah i'm being single and no other responsibilities for yourself i guess you know it's i can i can i've been pretty happy i've i've haven't tried to upgrade myself right now that's uh right you know i could i could have you know get something nice and upgrade but i just uh i'm consulting right now so oh really i just made my first job hop about eight months ago so uh uh what  okay all right what uh what kind of camping is there in Texas well there there are quite a few um parks i guess state parks and there's a couple of national parks i guess that you can camp at um-hum um most of them have pretty good facilities i don't know if the camping that i've done is really roughing it without a a whole lot of stuff yeah so you do uh like backpacking and the like uh done a little bit of that mainly just um camping out at state parks i've been to a couple in Texas and there's some real nice ones in Arkansas uh-huh um i think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around huh is the Ozarks in Arkansas um-hum yeah part of them are yeah so that's probably a pretty nice place to go yeah they've got uh real nice lake system and around their parks and one of them uh the Gray i think that's one of the ones we've been to it's is real nice there a bunch of lakes around it there's a golf course and um um-hum just a whole bunch of camping sites yeah what about you where have you uh oh i've been camping for years not on a regular basis but uh i first started camping out in the desert in California uh-huh and then sometimes in the mountains also in California and uh then i moved to North Carolina and i i didn't camp for a long time and then i started to uh go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting so i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting um-hum and then maybe camp another night and drive home and that was uh that was pretty good so i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear and uh you know i still do it once in a while yeah i think we've collected stuff off and on over the years the more times we did it the more serious we get about it uh-huh yeah where where is Raleigh in North Carolina uh well it's it's uh in terms of north south i would say it's uh a little a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it okay so what it so you're kind of away from the Blue Ridge Mountains that area well it it's uh actually the the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh they're about three hours away if you go due north um-hum um uh the Blue Ridge in North Carolina i think are much nicer and you can pick those up going west but then you're talking about six to eight hours yeah the way it works but um it's a real it's a real nice place to go and camp and there's some pretty decent campgrounds although i don't think Raleigh i don't think the state of North Carolina takes they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might um-hum yeah my wife's from the western part of Virginia we've been down the parkway a lot but i didn't know how much how much camping areas there were along there i think there's quite a few i can't say i've checked them all out though what what's it like camping in the desert and California that seems like a challenge it's uh it's actually kind of incredible it's really really nice um i like it better than almost anything i've ever done just the sky is so amazing you know you really can probably count thousands of stars and uh um-hum it's it's just kind of nice i like the uh i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which um a lot of people don't realize you know they hear desert and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry and lack of water course it it has all of those qualities but it also has a certain quality of beauty that's you just don't find anywhere else except in a desert um-hum so it's pretty nice the uh the movie The Doors has some some nice desert scenes those guys all go camping out in the desert yeah of course they drag a lot of drugs with them but um the uh the shots are are pretty nice and it's sort of like that i mean it's just almost surreal in some places it's very pleasant hm are are the temperatures real extreme there or they just they can be yeah i mean you got to you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen um-hum what i've been i've been camping in Death Valley one doesn't go in July yeah true but it's beautiful in February i mean it's just beautiful the days get up into the high eighties yeah huh uh maybe the nineties but it's it's quite bearable and then the nights are reasonably warm you know sixties or seventies it's just great it's really very nice yeah we've talked about planning a trip up through um i have a sister-in-law that lives in New Mexico up through New Mexico and into Colorado and the Grand Canyon area i don't know don't know when i'm going to get a chance to do that but yeah well that would be that would be pretty nice i've been i have been camping on the south rim of the Grand Canyon that's okay a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside i was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking especially with my gear um-hum i'll bet yeah one one thing you said about the stars is really true it's when you're close to a big city like Dallas the the lights kind of wash wash out the star so it's nice to oh yeah to get away it's just amazing how how much you miss yeah it yeah it really it really is i mean i don't think i ever see the Little Dipper you hear people talk about the Little Dipper hm um-hum but i don't think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in in the mountains otherwise it's just too faint well i guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject yeah i think we fulfilled our obligation well thanks for calling nice talking to you um yeah it was good talking to you Robert bye-bye okay bye-bye  yeah so uh what are your favorite TV shows one that i can't find anymore which is Gabriel's Fire oh i haven't watched that very much is that do you like that yes when was that on it was usually on um Thursday nights on ABC i don't know uh oh oh yeah well um um it may be that um it was recently replaced by actually by um by what may be my favorite TV show of because sort of uh um Twin Peaks it was same time period yes yeah so Twin Peaks um what happened was i think Twin Peaks um went went off they moved to a Saturday night for a while and then put and then put something i guess Gabriel's Fire on it and at Thursday nights and then they moved um no Gabriel's Fire was on CBS i think i i take that back i'm not sure but anyway they moved it back and forth and that's when Peaks was back in that time slot as well so i don't know you don't know what happened to Gabriel's Fire then no i have no idea i don't think i don't think that was on ABC anyway i don't know what happened to it though i don't remember one from one station to another i keep forgetting one station what's your second favorite um it's hard to say i'm sort of a very big Twin Peaks fan and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on i'm i'm half the time i'm a TV addict and the other half the time i just ignore it it's really bad yeah there's some new shows that i sort of like um have you seen this Shannon Steel Show or uh it's about a lawyer it's one of these lawyer shows you know they they seem to be popular these days and then there's just a lot of those sort of Blair shows floating around oh is he the reformed um gambler yes yes yes yes i just i mean like i just finished watching that a few minutes ago um and it and that that's a interesting one i i i like that because there's there are i've noticed that every every major station now has their own law show there's LA Law and there's um Equal Justice some other one Law And Order or something lots of lots of these things that are floating around now they seem to be popular shows do you like the law shows or i really don't watch that much TV what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch and then on the nights i can watch i'll pick out something but um that that makes logical sense also saves a lot of time with commercials you're not kidding do you ever watch American Gladiators oh i have i've i've caught i watched that late um i guess it's on late Saturday nights or something that's on during the day as well midnight midnight have you have have you seen this often i tape it oh really yeah i tape it because i don't stay up that late to watch it i tape it yeah but i understand uh that in England they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program really i don't know that and i'm like i don't believe this i that don't it it it seems like i mean if wrestling is prime time professional wrestling it seems like it's just just just like pros in a wrestling to me i don't i don't see any difference though i don't either i i don't understand it they consider it violent i have so ever i have seen it on where we are i live in uh Rochester New York and i think a you're in New York yes oh where are you i'm in Dallas Texas you're uh everybody i speak to is in Texas oh oh yeah but i'm i'm in New York and uh we seem we seem to have um i think the American Gladiators is on Sunday afternoons actually around here oh really as well sometimes i think it's been on i think i've seen it during the day i know i've seen it during the day in Florida when i was at my parents down there oh definitely seen it done on on during the day down there and i don't think it's a very violent show i think it's funny i think it's a real good concept i think it's something completely new i think it's great i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else and competition i'm going oh great you know well it's a it's a great role model for everybody yeah i think so i think because people sort of get through you know um i think that people sort of learn the importance of sort of physical fitness as well as the as well as you know some mental fitness and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth oh yes i mean when i had uh i was watching it the first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities and uh there she was terrific she was really terrific well don't they take people who have some sort of um big abilities like and and at least they used to when it when it the first ones i saw they had um a man on who was uh he played college football and almost went pro and they had a a woman who was a black belt in karate and she was the uh she was in the junior Olympics or something or they seem to have people who have very very big sports backgrounds to have they leaned leaned away from that sort of they hold competitions in Los Angeles in um Florida and Minneapolis Minneapolis um um trying to think of i think it's in four places around the United States they hold competition and the only requirement is of course your skill of passing these tests oh that's how they do it and that's it and we had a bar man from here in Dallas area that made it there is a woman that uh made really well she called herself a craft person so i'm not quite sure what she made and uh she made it i mean there is no your occupation has nothing to do with it yeah okay i just thought they had some strictly your skill yeah i thought they had some sort of i mean i thought they were just poor people like us i guess not that's great huh-uh but maybe i'll try it one day i will get on it one day and see if i can uh um what what do they win they they win money i think don't they i think the last i heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars really uh-huh wow all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour yeah that's you know just minor just minor little ball here or there you know one little ball here and there yeah and this guy's beating you up so i don't mind the beating up part i i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt oh well they they come out with a lot of bruises too they look like yeah they seem like a tennis ball but there also doesn't look like it's almost livable yeah but best it i i don't think i could i i could handle those tennis balls so what else to you tape besides American Gladiators at there anything else hey huh see i tape Murder She Wrote okay i like mysteries oh okay i like mysteries i tape um Father Dowling uh-huh because that's another mystery and i don't have to concentrate too hard on them but i'm sure that's fun um most of the lawyer programs like uh Law And Order uh-huh they're not on the times that i've got that i've watched because i haven't had T got TV Guide around here in ages oh okay well they seem to be on later all always right right before the news is when i catch them yeah i i tend to if nothing else i tend to turn on the television at eleven o'clock just to watch the news and or or Nightline or something just sort of get a good you know a good a good think for the day your news is on at eleven yes when is yours on ten i was just in the middle of watching it oh gosh well i'm sorry i interrupted um oh that's okay no problem yeah ours is on actually it ours is on at eleven it it's um eleven o'clock now here or eleven twenty five now here in New York um i think they would they do that i think they put things on at um eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock um California time like in California but in the middle they sort of um like central time or mountain time they they push things back so i was actually actually i'm not sure i was in i was in Iowa awhile ago and noticed that everything was an hour earlier so does your prime time start at seven o'clock no well they have it at six and they have it at nine wait no no not not even the news but do they have like um and they have one at ten do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth start at seven o'clock you so like you know the regular television shows that are that are very popular do they start at seven or or at eight i'm trying to think both um let's see they start um Evening Shade at seven and then it goes to um what is it after Evening um right because that would actually start at eight o'clock here that's Major Dad at eight i think it is yeah that that would all start at at um that would all start at at eight o'clock here that wouldn't start at seven we have um at seven o'clock we just have um the they'll play you know they have old reruns of Cheers or something from seven to seven thirty and then something else from seven thirty to eight but then at at eight o'clock is when everything starts huh which is which is strange i mean because yours start at seven and end at ten and ours start at at at at at eight and end at eleven that's why we i i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten yeah it's it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs at that point which could be one of you know many different night programs but it goes into night programs but uh do you ever watch Cheers oh that's great oh all the time do you watch Cheers or oh yeah oh yeah there's there's it's at that was actually a big dilemma for me now because um Cheers Cheers and Twin Peaks are now on the same time  um she asked if i i guess they went ahead and told you we're supposed to be talking about uh drug testing and what do we think about the policy of most companies and government agencies and of course that's something we're familiar with right um you want to go ahead or okay go ahead no no go ahead um personally it was something that uh i mean i know it presents an emotional issue moral issue people feel like maybe my rights are being violated but i work in human resources so i work with a lot of folks that um are in accidents or where safety considerations are concerned and okay yeah i really feel like that TI's decision to go with drug testing was good you know because i i feel like that you know well all all it takes is one person coming to work under the influence of some narcotic um truly injure a lot more of our workers yeah and that's that's funny you're in human resources and i'm in uh health and safety are you yes um i think it's a good idea i i i don't think that they've gone far enough though i think they should they should uh also test for alcohol well now the thing you you know course they've always said separately that um you know we have a we have a policy on alcohol course if anybody's under the uh influence or if you have reasonable suspicion then that would result in corrective action for them also and that of course has been in place for years right but but it's not specifically tested for that yeah yeah no and and from everything that i can gather you know reading different articles and and just a newspaper in general uh uh news on the um television it seems that alcohol is the is the most prevalent um addictive addictive drug yeah even though the all the college campuses now the they're saying that the majority of of uh students uh drink um-hum and most of them are partying but yet we don't test for that and i wonder if we don't do that because it is so prevalent and would put probably lose a quarter of all our population here how long does alcohol stay in the system i mean like if somebody went out and had some drinks the night before is that going to be there the next day well they say your system a normal a normal person should be able to metabolize an ounce of alcohol per hour okay and then again it it depends depends on the the bigger you are and you know the more bulk that you have you you can your system can tolerate more alcohol so a large person can probably um metabolize maybe a little bit more uh-huh than a smaller person but even that yeah if you go out you know because some people go out maybe oh you know they drink up a gallon yeah they do um what's what's the uh consensus down there when when uh TI announced that uh the drug testing program did you get a lot of uh animosity against that we had i didn't get a lot no not like i expected um we had you know one or two that were extremely outspoken you know felt like it really violated their rights and and um and it was not the people that i would have expected um it's uh one of them stands out in my mind as an extremely uh just a super person in management you know and he's he's very family oriented his family's very close he he also opposes in the schools like for his kids because he says you know we are a good Christian family we do not do this type of thing it definitely violates our rights and he was very outspoken yeah but for the most part people were like well i don't like it uh it's not something i prefer to do but i understand the reasoning and i think part of the attitude is that i think TI went to really great lengths in communicating and tried to prepare them and and tell them why and you know they didn't just announce it without really any forethought yes no that's you're right yeah and uh i i think they don't go far enough uh kind of on a different vein and that is that i think every time we have any type of industrial accident at TI i think somebody ought to be tested immediately and you know maybe that's just me personally but i i feel like sure that's an idea too i just uh you know i i feel like if something happens uh that causes an accident you ought to test the parties involved immediately just just if if nothing else to rule it out yeah that's a that's a thought um i don't know if you can go um depends on the severity of the accident i think you know if you get like up here because we've got heavy industry we've got you know uh uh smelting plant and we've got a yeah we've got a lot of uh metals rolling and slitting and stuff like that so we've got a lot of we are we end up with a lot of uh hand injuries you know cuts and things like that but perhaps um yes if you could weed out those the people that have chronic accidents and test those you know that's a start uh-huh and that's a good idea that's a good point i guess what makes me think of that you know uh you hear them doing that like it's a or like Amtrak you know if if they have a derailment or or transportation industry it seems like if there's accidents train accidents things like that they test and i think well why not because we do have some large industrial accidents sometimes yes uh you know if you have a large acid spill you know well gee maybe you better check this person who's handling all these acids you know i work with a wafer fab so we do a lot with chemicals and acids and oh okay yeah uh things like that but i i do feel like companies are justified and i do feel like i i mean i i guess i hate as an individual that anything like this has ever become necessary in our you know in our nation but but i feel like that it's a good thing to do well i can see transportation because now you're dealing with or they have the responsibility over a great number of people that's true rather than themselves um but but thinking on that yeah because we've got we've got truck drivers here that go between plants you know locally um-hum and carry material and they carry acids and things too sure um i don't know what the what the uh company plant is they went through i guess key personnel first uh-huh and then it funneled down to uh the general population uh-huh now that started in January of last year but i wonder if yeah and i i still haven't been called yet in fact yeah in fact out of our office staff is let's see there's uh four six there's seven of us and there's only one been called is that right well i've been lucky i've been called twice well i oh oh i i should probably shouldn't be talking to you then right no i had to test once um when they did the key personnel they test all human resource folks and so i i i was once there and then in the general random sampling last year i was i contacted okay and then you just got lucky again right yeah and that you know i have that same uneasy feeling that other folks have you know i know i i mean i don't drink i don't smoke i don't do nothing yeah yeah i used to smoke years ago but i don't now you know but you still walk in there and go gee what if something i ate what if something i've done what if something i've eaten shows up well it's not only that but i've read different articles and they said even the even the best of labs they come back with erroneous samples and even if they get a a reading i guess they test the same sample again um-hum yeah and they're going to get the same reading suppose they uh you know it's a do they crucify you right then and there or do they do they go back and retest well now if the lab is making an error on the sample then when they retest the error should not be there uh but they retest the same sample yeah but the error is on the part of the lab not on the sample in other words if somebody makes a mistake in what they're reading then they're not going to get the same reading the second time oh i see oh okay but if they do then you're you're pretty well if they do then you have you always have the recourse um you know before we do anything we sit down and talk with the person about is there any reason why this should have shown up and a lot of times you know uh condemned right to be retested they'll go oh yeah i was on a prescription for this and they can go get it and bring it in yeah you know in which case they're fine obviously those are recorded as negatives if you're under you know legal qualified medical care um yeah but i often wondered wondered about that too if if we're talking marijuana if it's in the system uh then yeah yeah you know that would be grounds for uh if it's their second positive it would be grounds for termination if it's their first positive then they're setup with E A P counseling do you know of any incidences of of of uh erroneous uh we've had a couple you know something they they make a mistake the lab made a mistake and it really wasn't nothing no no in fact see TI actually sends uh test samples from time to time uh oh just to see just just to check on a lab just to check the validity of the lab yeah and uh so that's kind of an ongoing test process for the we do for Compucam and you know they don't know which ones are test samples uh we must be yeah we must be doing the same up here too we we're probably send to a different lab than you guys down there yeah i don't think so i think the whole company uses Compucam which is over there on the east coast somewhere oh and ours actually are mailed there uh they're the i think the largest and they do a lot of the government contractors they have an excellent excellent rate um oh yeah and just uh they  what i mean hobbies do you enjoy uh well lets see i suppose i could say i enjoy joy crocheting um gardening knitting uh hiking do you have a lot of spare time to do it in or is it something you kind of have to make time for well it seems like i don't have time for them but i'm i don't work full-time or anything um-hum i sell Avon and Stanley products um-hum but it's that's not you know the same as an eight hour job well it can't from what i've heard understood it can can be yeah it's it's up to the person sometimes yeah well i i enjoy needlepoint although boy i guess i got myself burned out i did too much too fast and uh uh-huh for some reason my eyes aren't quite what they used to be either oh and um you sound young yeah yeah i am but i i don't know it's just maybe it's the light but uh-huh and um i enjoy photography as a hobby oh good and boating and horseback riding although i'm recovering from back surgery so it's going to be awhile before i can do either one of those uh-huh um um-hum um-hum and bowling and right now my biggest hobby i guess since um you know recovering is watching television and playing Nintendo with my son yeah that could be a little boring sometimes i guess too but and i do enjoy reading uh-huh um i do read a lot read quite a lot uh-huh uh i enjoy reading different types of things uh-huh i enjoy reading novels then uh you know more serious stuff how how old is your little boy today is his birthday yeah yeah oh is it really oh how old six oh that's nice my baby's expecting her first baby this month say yes oh really oh how exciting that could it's always so our children our children are all grown up do they live close by just one of them the one that's going to have the baby well that's good you that will be your new hobby then taking care of grandbaby um-hum yeah um my sister's going to have a baby this summer uh-huh so but i guess that's a little off the subject yeah i don't know i've tried various things i've tried to get interested in things like refinishing furniture woodworking or um ceramics but it just seems like it's so expensive to break into something new um um-hum that um you know with my i've got quite enough of an investment in my photography equipment yeah that we we had for a while done uh well we still do a lot of picture taking in that and uh we're in the process of putting our eight millimeter um-hum uh films and now the kids and i were going to put them on video oh yeah and we're we're in the process of doing that right now and are you doing that yourself yeah how do you do it uh we bought the equipment uh that you do it with you don't have to i mean is the something that you don't have to see it as you it's not like your well the you buy this little little piece of equipment and you use your video camera of course and uh your projector um-hum um-hum oh okay that's what i wondered and the combination you the way you connect you know connect them up do they make good quality copies do you think uh i think it's going to we were a little worried there was a lot of background noise on it but uh we can hook it into our uh stereo system after we get the pictures all done um-hum we can hook it into our uh a video or uh stereo system and uh put music to the film and that will cut out all the background the noise of the uh recorder running and that yeah oh well that's nice because the projector made a lot makes a lot of noise yeah i remember those we've never had one my parents never had one but um yeah and uh so that's been kind and our darkroom is very we have a darkroom but it's very dusty oh that's my dream i guess is to have my own darkroom we we're real active in it for a long time but you know you get busy and yeah um the kids grow up and they're expensive to maintain just the chemicals are expensive yeah we mainly just did a bit of black and white it's yeah i would still like black and white uh-huh to me black and white is photography color is more snapshot oh you can really get some good really good pictures in black and white yeah you really can people don't realize that that um-hum not realize that black and white it nowadays it's actually more expensive than uh color um-hum it's hard to even find film or anything yeah yeah but uh and i well i used to i learned how to knit when i was little my grandmother knitted a lot uh-huh and she knitted all the time did she and uh before she passed away and made some beautiful things but i've never really learned how to do more than the basic oh that's great yeah yeah i don't do a whole it uh time seems to be hard to find for anything you want to do i don't know why um-hum you yeah i know you'd think i'd have a lot of time but yeah you'd think i would too but you know but i i i'm knitting an afghan for the baby and i haven't worked on this for several weeks i just haven't got back to it um when's the baby due the twenty ninth time to get busy do you know if it's going to be a boy or a girl i don't know i don't know they don't really care what they have is it her first one yeah yeah they didn't want to know so uh well but but i do enjoy it i i i enjoy painting some too but i i really really have trouble finding time i did did some toll painting for a while and i started doing a still life and it's it never got finished yeah that's something i've it's interesting to me people who watch people who are that know how to paint i just felt like that's something i've never been very good at or very good at drawing or anything well had have you watched any of these things on TV these large brush i've watched uh i've yeah here and there but they make it look uh i i know that you know they just make it look so easy but i know it i'm smart enough to know that it's not quite that easy um-hum well once you start it apparently it's not bad some of the girls have gone into the call age group Claritin University is just not too far from here um-hum they've gone in and uh done a class on the large brush and actually did the painting yeah and you know they've never done anything and they come out pretty nice yeah i've yeah and i know a girl that used to do it and hers did too but i just don't think see myself whipping out masterpieces in thirty minutes like they do on the shows do you enjoy cooking yeah i like to cook i like to cook but i've really gotten away from it it's with just two my son and myself it's just not yeah i don't do a lot of fancy cooking to me it's just he you know i hate you know hate to admit this but we live on frozen food well it depends on what it is uh you know well now we i we garden have a small garden and i can i do canning yeah they have and uh yeah i like gardening that's of course that's something i can't do with my back uh yeah and uh my back that's too bad was it lower back or yeah my dad's grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and we always had fresh vegetables which i just really like and um-hum yeah that's one thing that our gardening we're getting it my husband he's retired but he's having trouble now and he's not not allowed to mow the grass we have a lot of grass takes me about four hours to do our lawn um oh you have to do it oh gosh and uh and you know he's really shouldn't run the um and things like that so it makes it a little bit difficult but i i do love to garden my kids loved it because i never allowed anybody in my garden that didn't like to do it i didn't want anybody in my garden i was a grump do you garden vegetables or flowers or both or mostly vegetables yeah mostly vegetables i had grew some flowers but mostly vegetables yeah there's nothing like fresh vegetables picked out of the garden yeah yeah uh but well it's been nice talking to you yes well i hope you have a nice birthday today for your son well you too well he's having his party until Friday but uh-huh uh-huh he knows today today after the little something today because he knows it's his birthday to make it special but uh-huh yeah yeah well you have a nice day okay bye-bye okay you too and thanks a lot bye-bye  okay what are your feelings on crime and what can be done about it i'd be interested in hearing since you are a prison guard the problem goes all the way back to the entire criminal justice system needs to be reworked boy that's for sure i agree there no longer do we have a point where the crime fits the punishment we've got guys now with in Texas anyway is what i'm talking about um-hum with the situation we've got with prison overcrowding and everything a man gets a fifteen year sentence they're averaging serving one month for every year assessed right that's not the punishment is not fitting the crime now no that's for sure i mean it's it's kind of sad when you have to give them more than one life sentence in order to insure that they're going to stay in for a while i mean you know even that's what i even gone have gone to the point where i don't believe in giving them a life sentence if you have to do that you might as well shoot them yeah it costs twenty five thousand dollars per inmate per year just to keep them locked up that doesn't count any medical or dental health they get wow a bullet costs twenty five cents you tell me which one's more cost effective um yeah and who's paying for it certainly not the people that are in there the the victims in in a in the sense are paying for it the victims and and the citizens of Texas right right no yeah they do need to to drastically do something uh about the whole works because uh it's obvious especially with the introduction of drugs now that crime is is there's it's in such the uprise i mean there's so much more of it now than there was even fifteen years ago as long as you've got the problem a big part of the problem anyway take a look at most of your politicians that are in now ninety percent of them yes are practicing lawyers right as long as you got practicing lawyers in politics they're going to rig the laws to where they know they're never going to run out of business um-hum as far as hard line laws dealing with criminals we don't have them in this country anymore we have situation ethics oh i believe that i do john Q Citizen goes up robs the liquor store shoots the guy behind the counter his his uh lawyer is going to argue that well my client was under the influence of whatever drug he was on at the time and he wasn't really in his normal frame frame of mind well apparently he had enough snapping to where he got it whatever weapon he used and he was coherent enough to tell the guy give me the money or i'm going to kill you right yeah if he if he had enough snap to do that he knew what he was doing the penalty assessed is death period um-hum well i that's too simple i yeah i know uh that is too simple well people keep saying well what if they you know but uh they're uh look at how long people sit on death row that's before they even do i mean they've been assigned the death penalty and they don't even do it you know well that's that's one of my biggest screams about the entire death penalty goes for yeah in this country they just appeal it and appeal it and appeal it um-hum if a person has done a crime so bad that the jury gives them the death penalty now the Supreme Court says we've got to give them one appeal okay i agree give them one appeal when that appeal fails within thirty days execution of sentence okay one right but that's all yes look i mean that has to be one of the biggest wasters of money is the years that these guys sit on death row i mean i think that you know of the the uh he run across a man's file that was like on death row for nine years before they finally got around to executing him oh no i mean look at them i think you keeping him on death row for nine years was cruel and unusual torture oh yeah they're you know they say that they can't uh inflict cruel cruel and unusual punishment but boy what is that knowing that any day the shoe could drop i mean yeah uh-huh that's it i mean nine years that's incredible oh i don't know what the average is uh uh for eight eight is the average wow is the average because they'll appeal it for that many times hum-um it should be never it should that should have a cutoff time just like uh uh statutes of limits and everything all that other stuff you know they they should have like within one year so that they'd have enough time for an appeal and uh you know get that stuff out of the way and if it's turned down the the you know after that if if two people have said it then two is enough they shouldn't even allow the lawyers to go any further i think they're kind of bending the law just they just want more money is what it is i'm sorry they want the money so they're going to yeah they will twist it and bend it well uh that's kind of obvious i mean they're even carrying it to to where now uh that they advertise on TV you know if your if you uh you know have done this or if you need this uh uh we'll sue for you and you don't have to pay us unless you but then what they don't tell you is that if you if they win you give them at least a third of the of the thing that they win so i don't know it is uh it's getting to be more business now rather than uh actually uh dealing with the crime than with uh um the uh punishment they the the lawyers are just in it for the money i'm i'm convinced i know i i agree with you i think you're real you're very right that the politicians should i think they should have an equal amount of you know maybe they can have a few but i think most of them should be not uh lawyers in the fact and that's way way they've gotten into politics it's because of the the law things you know the loops and everything but uh but no i know we it um we're in Maryland and uh we have the same thing overcrowding and and uh they are letting them out i mean just the regular jail sentence thing they let them out because of they don't have any place to keep to put them so somebody that could you know uh unless uh been a major offense but uh uh even the piddly little stuff i mean the the guys that loses today in America is the victim and whoever that may be whether it's a robbery or drugs or whatever else um they are the ones that are going to pay and they are the one that are going to suffer and the other person you know if they pay if they if they uh arrest them uh and uh then the you know time the law takes over uh half the time uh they either let them go or they get off with a a sentence because they've had a lawyer that you know feels that that they weren't all together when they did it things are going to come to a point it's going to probably get to such an extent where the average American citizen if they see a crime go down or a crime is happening against them they're not going to worry about trying to get a policeman they're not going to worry about it because they're going to be packing their own heat and they're going to take care of business themselves right although you know uh that uh it's kind of a catch twenty two because if you defend yourself or as there was a case where this fellow in Baltimore kept having his store broken into uh through a vent in the ceiling in the ceiling u h the roof so he put an electric grate there well somebody tried to break in got stuck and was electrocuted and he was being sued because this guy was breaking into his store he got electrocuted and was killed coming into his store that's where if you had judges that had any backbone whatsoever they'd have thrown that out before it even got that's right that's right you know now here's the innocent guy that's just trying to keep in business you know he had tried dogs he tried security people he tried you know several other things the dogs like they would just kill the dogs you know so uh it's it's it's wrong your right um i it it seems unfortunate and a little frustrating because it seems like we have citizens the there isn't mu ch we can do um you try to hope that uh you know your senators and your representatives and uh are going to represent what the people want but uh uh they certainly i'm not sure which way to take to shake up the system bad enough to start making some reforms sure would be nice to see it happening soon because it's obvious that uh pretty soon they're not going to be able to handle you know all of the crime that there is so i don't know uh it must be especially frustrating to you having do you work there now or is was this uh uh was this before i work there now oh okay so it's just another job uh it must be especially frustrating because even your rights in there are when i walk through this is what's bad when i walk through the front gate the inmates have more rights than i do yeah and boy does that stink uh that's the same way here uh and they have more freedom i mean i understand that i mean i'm not i mean you can't be everywhere all the time and i'm sure that they have searches and everything but i mean the weapons that they make or that they get and the i mean to me it'd be like walking around in a time bomb all the time even just being there you know just working there um because you never know if you're going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary uh and yet some days it is yeah well they and yet did they can they do anything to them when they're in prison i mean surely they can put them in solitary or something i mean or is that just mythical uh you can put a there's um any number of things you can do aside from locking up in solitaire you can reduce their class in good time have them sent to a harder prison than what they're already locked up into they've got the different security class you've got your minimum in minimum out you've got your medium and then oh okay i didn't know that  i like everything but jazz you like everything but jazz what don't you like about jazz i just don't the the beat the tempo the whatever it is that makes it jazz just grates on my nerves i just so do you like do you like rhythm and blues yes i like rhythm and blues and i like country western and i like yeah Waylon okay i like country western it's my favorite yeah Willie Willie Waylon and the boys in fact we bought uh The Eagle uh on a cassette tape i think The Eagle's even the name of the tape before it became the the song of the war uh-huh yeah uh-huh so yes do you like um any rock and roll at all i like some uh art course we have a twenty five year old son who loves hard rock and i'm not right i can't stand that no i'm not that much on hard rock but he does have a lot of cassettes of uh CDs that i like the i guess you'd have to call it soft rock i like Rod Stewart and and some of the things he does yeah yeah in fact uh when our car was stolen of a little over a year ago in Baltimore i had a Rod Stewart tape in there that i was thinking the other day that i ought to replace because i really kind of miss that music but yeah some of my favorite groups are like Chicago and uh oh some of the i guess what what you could call softer rock groups they were the bigger groups in the seventies and till all the heavy metal and all that came in and um-hum that's too much isn't it yeah i don't care for that at all it's it's so loud and the so many of the lyrics are so offensive and yeah gosh we don't need that no i got away from all that rock and roll stuff probably ten years ago and just started listening to the country when you matured i like some classical to and yeah i guess so i like some classical some of that stuff grates on my nerves too like you were saying earlier about the other i just stir up but there are some pieces that are really pretty um-hum um-hum i think we hear more crap classical music than we think we do because of how much of it's used in commercials right commercials and cartoons and things like that um-hum they slipped that in on us when we're not looking uh-huh try to give it to us subliminally that's cheating isn't it well i think we like the same kind of music nice chatting with you that's right i think so same here  okay um what baseball team are you familiar with well i'm only a little bit familiar with the Red Sox because i lived up in Boston for a while really and um the Mets oh now come on no Texas Rangers after that if you asked me that i wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball really i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later but um i understand a little bit about the Texas Rangers i know George Bush threw out the first pitch the other night and it bounced off the ground and that um that i heard a joke on the radio yesterday that in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system and uh the which was kind of cruel i mean think the the shame that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground i mean golly how humiliating for a man to do that any man i don't care if you're President yeah but at the same time i don't know it's pretty far to throw that far i couldn't do it i know but he's a man come on men know how to do that right right he's supposed to be able to do that i know so i felt kind of sorry for him i said oh no that must have been hard on him because he's just a person but um i know his son is a major owner of our team of the team here oh really i didn't know that yeah he's like i thought he was the owner but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner but he must own the biggest chunk because that's all you hear about is if you know about Neal Bush i think is his name see i even know his name because he's on the news a lot and i never hardly watch the news not you know not like some people hour and a half a day or anything I have yeah and i've been watching uh my husband's French and so if i've been watching the French news when i watch it it's incentive speaking of Bush we're going to get a little off topic but speaking of Bush they that had uh-huh a story where he went to visit some little uh elementary school students and stuff did you see that where he the guy asked him for proof of who he was and he showed his license oh i saw that yeah i want to see your driver's i i i don't i you're not President Bush i know and i want to see a credit card i know and he pulled that out that is so funny i heard it on the radio i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car but i didn't see it but it was so funny to see it was a really cute little kid too that's about my extent of um about baseball i don't know that much about it well i can tell you that the Mets opened i think two days ago because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game and i couldn't tell you who pitched but they won the Mets won but yeah not my a lot and then somebody else lost uh-huh uh-huh did they maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees but i don't even know if they're still New York Yankees or the New Jersey yeah uh-huh that's so stupid that you all have two teams that's really stupid well but it then then they can have them play against each other yeah i know i think it's still the New York Yankees you know for some reason i thought they were moving to New Jersey this is how much i know about baseball yeah the Texas Rangers they they lost i think uh-huh but i know that last year we did go to a baseball game last year we got free tickets because someone at our church one of the deacons at church um parks cars at the Mansion at Turtle Creek which is like one of the uh the places and stuff uh-huh and he's their head chauffeur is this funny as they're parking the cars the valet service right yeah he makes good money too doing that you'd be shocked i was shocked but anyway someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year uh-huh and then the Iranian couldn't he didn't want them so he gave them to Alan and Alan and his Dad had plans that night so they gave them to us so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian with baseball tickets valet with baseball tickets and we ended up with them right and so we were walking up and i looked at my husband and i said you know what Kyle yeah it's pretty funny this is The Mansion at Turtle Creek a tip i bet these are really good seats and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor and you know we just they called us at five and the game started at seven so we just threw everything together ran over and got the tickets and wow left and so we took two kids with us and nobody brings two children in these seats you know because because they're fancy seats and stuff yeah and you just sit down and all the girls were all dressed up and all this you know i just was there you know like i made it i'm here you know and uh it was just kind of funny because you know but we got to sit by first base if they'd hit a ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in you know i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game i rarely go but we went last year because my brother my brother is impossible when um he does football leagues and baseball leagues and all kinds of stuff and if there's a game on he's watching it i mean that's all there is to it and he's like glued at the TV uh-huh uh-huh really oh i'm glad my husband's not like that oh i'm glad my husband's not like that either i'd kill him my brother's like that and um see he goes to a lot of games not a real lot but he tries to go then my father got us some tickets so my brother's wife and my husband and i went last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because you know being a non American uh-huh uh-huh you want to see what a baseball game is like and he describes it as you sit there in a crowd and it was nice weather and stuff it wasn't a real problem but you sit there in a crowd and you're waiting and waiting and waiting and you eat these lousy the hot dogs um because we made him try a hot dog you know and things like that and um that's funny and um so you sit there and you wait for the longest time really bored and then all of a sudden something happens but you happen to look the other way during the time yeah and so you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen and when it happened he missed it you miss the whole thing that's funny and didn't understand it and it where is he from in France um he grew up out well he grew up in Le Ren which is the sort of um oh strip east to west eastern part of France uh-huh yeah i have a i had a friend in college from Strasbourg yeah he's not that far he was sort of in between Strasbourg and Paris uh-huh Paris and my cousin lives in Paris and she's lived there for like oh off and on for twenty years oh is she still there uh huh Saint Claude is that sound familiar yeah because yeah Saint Claude yeah we used to that's one of the um entrances to the periphery to get in and out of the city oh really and it it it it sits right at the limit uh-huh i don't know exactly where she is but um that's neat yeah she does and they have twelve children we we met in Paris twelve children oh my God the poor woman she has twelve children she looks gorgeous no she's gorgeous a nd she just liked having kids and she's thin and i mean all my friends with four or more children are thin i mean i'm not kidding you were any of them twins you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than two of them no you have i have a friend now that has seven and um and they're all eight and under uh-huh or nine and under they're all real young they're just really feel like that's what God's told them to do but they're not condemning you if you we only have one child you know they don't say they don't put airs on about it or anything which is good because it would be easy i'm sure for them to do that you know you get a conviction like that and you think everyone should have it and so i'm real proud of them because they're aren't really they don't do that at all you go in their bathroom and there's ten tooth brushes in there and i always give her a hard time i go now come on who's toothbrush did you really use this morning uh-huh but how do they afford to even have the kids uh we're expecting our first baby almost any day uh-huh they live lean for one thing and they tithe and they really believe the Bible says that tithe puts it puts a hole in your money bag we don't honor God with the first portion and so they i think that helps a lot i think that's the key and and he like his sales last year he just works a normal job he probably has an income of thirty five thousand but last year he made one sale that got him a bonus of twenty five thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van uh-huh you know it's God i mean it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done and he got to do it and so God just really blesses him in ways like that just trust God because i don't know kids are a blessing and and some people we think of blessings as wow nice furniture and things like that but kids are just as much of a blessing as all these material things but it's a different kind and a lot times people think oh well i'm not blessed i have an old car but you've got five kids you know you're just as blessed probably more uh-huh because if you follow this there's a good book called What the Bible Has to Say About Child Training by Richard Fugate and he's you know a lot of wisdom in it and the kids in the Bible talk about anything but training and training is different uh-huh than anything else in in psychology doesn't address it a lot of the psychology stuff the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the Bible and they don't quote you the proverb out of it but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work they just come out of the Bible and so this book it just really ties in all these things and how to train the child so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen uh-huh you know what i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing and so you know they do that and they they just live lean pretty much they don't she doesn't shop at Foley's you know and stuff like that but a lot women in Dallas shop at Foley's so Foley's it's like a Macy's kind of store it's pretty nice and everything's pretty expensive and you know you just can't do that and you don't go to baseball games as much or you get pictures like we did you know what i mean i don't i don't know what Foley's is uh-huh yeah you do these fun things you know in other kinds of ways and i know Manhattan's real expensive but um it's kind of a different situation because you're probably living in an apartment right yeah well that makes a really big difference but but still it's just as hard as having that but well he can your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids yeah well have a church state softball leagues so they're not all boys and uh-huh right now we don't have a girl's league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one and i just haven't gotten around to doing it i keep saying we need to have one they go okay then start one but everybody wants to do it but you know God's sitting on my heart and i just hadn't gotten around to doing it anyway so they could really only have four members on the team i think they only have four boys i don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet uh-huh but um they you wouldn't believe it though her kids are the they are so good i'm not kidding you but she does work with them and it's a commitment and that that's what they're called to do uh-huh i have a most of my friends i admire someone that can do that you know i really can i know i do too i most of my friends have three or four kids and they feel like you know that's really all that God wants for them and some of the people in our church use birth control and some of them don't i had my tubes tied so you  so what kind of neat hobbies do you have well i like gardening a lot i like to be outside um i like gardening i wish i had a green thumb though i've got a brown thumb that's what everything turns uh oh is but do you try keep trying anyway i keep trying uh you know you just can't can't give up on it uh i uh i bought some uh plants from Michigan Bulb Company they send them to you all ready alive no no i've never had any luck with their's oh really right i guess i guess these are going to croak too since i've got cats i decided to get some catnip oh lots and lots of catnip so it's it's still green and it's been two days so i'm encouraged no i i haven't had had good luck with that company uh i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail probably yeah but i've had to to get my money back from them and had better luck with with some of the the more expensive companies yeah there's a uh i don't know do you have Lowe's up there because they uh well its uh building uh contractor or building supplies place no um they they also have a garden shop and they they offer just as good a guarantee if you buy it from them uh-huh oh that's great now our local stores don't don't offer any guarantee yeah um but some of the the mail order ones that i've dealt with for roses and that they offer through through the first Summer hum yeah which at least if they if they take off the first year they're probably going to come up unless there's uh a terrible freeze or something yeah yeah yeah something like that uh i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff so i'm going to wait on those oh they're bulbs for Spring or Fall uh probably Spring but uh i don't much care about things like that i'll i'll make a little sort of greenhouse a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in something something to keep me occupied you see uh-huh uh-huh i'll uh buy some plastic and make a little house and cute yeah and watch the cats tear it up right i don't know that do cats bother bulbs i think more the mice or other rodents they they just like to get in and dig oh i see so if you have fresh dirt they'll oh they love to dig i had i had some uh i don't know what kind they are i've already forgotten just regular old flower seeds and i planted them and i was so i was so thrilled because they came up i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that uh gee so i have to hang these things high so they can't get to them especially the catnip how many cats do you have oh okay three actually i just put a uh little fence around my yard uh um which is i suppose technically illegal but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it and it it's got this one inch mesh and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out and i love it um yeah yeah because they they like to get in and fertilize things too but uh why would it be illegal well because we have these town uh i live in a townhouse and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission oh uh yeah right and you know they want uh privacy fences well if nobody yeah if nobody complains you're all right right right well they do walking tours too so um but at least because i back up to um a hillside where the uh wild animals are i think i can probably justify it um yeah an and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway right right i mean you know you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property right the first year the deer ate my garden and i was just astounded i'm going deer right here in the city yeah right here Bambi exactly uh gosh and so well let's see other than gardening which i fiddle at i'm not very good at what else do i mostly just computer stuff oh i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that uh cooking that's not really a hobby it's a necessity but but i enjoy it i like to think that i'm a very good cook oh great hobbies that's about it i don't have much time for hobbies so uh between being a student and trying to run a business on the side you don't have a lot of time right that keeps you busy yeah and raising cats i mean that could become a hobby well it's it started out as a hobby actually uh it just it developed into sort of a business uh you know we breed them and all that uh-huh um but we didn't you know we didn't really start it for the money it was just they were fun to have around and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds and and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them and you know all this kind of stuff uh-huh uh-huh what kind of cats are they uh i've got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian wow yeah the himmy is probably the sweetest one she's she's just a little sweetheart we uh the the Bombay had a litter uh last October and i just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed only going to breed them once oh okay and uh she's not she's not feeling too great today um is that typical to only breed them once no uh most most breeders are in it for the money so they'll breed they'll breed them twice a year uh-huh uh-huh and i i just think that it's kind of i do n't know it's kind of cruel you know they just they just breed these they breed them before they're ready uh and right you're never you're never real and and they they do a lot of inbreeding too and so you end up with you know kind of strange kittens uh-huh uh-huh and i just don't like that so will you uh breed one of the litter then next year we're we sold all that litter oh um we there's not that much call to for Bombay's uh-huh um they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats oh i see uh so all you can do is sell them as pet quality uh-huh uh so what you've got is a registered pet and not too many people want Bombay's they want things like himmy Persians and Turkish Vans uh-huh Turkish Vans if you've never seen one i mean you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred it's just uh medium size short hair cat it's got he's mostly white with uh brown and black patches oh but they have nice personalities and they're very inquisitive um now the himmy we'll probably breed her a couple of times and we'll we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those right it's just the stud fees are so much though it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her we we want to breed her with a champion so uh-huh right now these are long haired yeah the Persian is uh-huh uh-huh and the other two are short hairs right oh that's nice yeah she's uh she's sweet going to have some nice kittens i hope uh-huh she's uh she's if you if you know what a Himalayan is generally they look something like uh well they come in a lot of different colors people don't realize it but they're sort of like uh Siamese in a way they have the uh they have the uh they have the gloves on the paws and they're they're usually two colored uh but this one is uh is she's predominantly predominantly uh black but she has chocolate uh paws chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters and yeah she's she's quite attractive looking gee uh-huh uh-huh hope hope the stud will find her attractive and that she has kittens that look like her and and that she has a whole bunch of kittens but we have to be careful uh you know we have to get a particular color point uh stud you can't just breed them with anything we have to get a uh we have to get a silver point himmy so the silver will be predominate in the kittens i see that's it that's the fun part trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with can't just go out there and say okay you guys breed you know you can't just tell them that anyway but oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby that's right well actually i mean it it is a business in a way but it it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats we're we're about to get another breed we're going we're going to buy a Devon Rex and i didn't i don't like Devon Rexes at first it's a well actually it's a mutant it it comes from England and uh from in the county of Devon what is it oh and it's a mutant cat and they're they're pretty expensive we're going to we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one um they're very thin they're they're they're long and lanky and skinny and they have real short hair it's curly as a matter of fact um um yeah it it it's a strange looking cat uh i didn't like them at first they've got great big ears huh interesting  well i don't know how you feel about this but uh it's really scary to me oh oh yeah me too there was a thing in our we have a little Lewisville paper that just comes out twice a week and there was a thing in there just this week saying that in all of Denton County Lewisville had the highest crime rate of all of Denton it well it's not surprising considering how close to Dallas it is i guess that's true but you know you've got to figure uh you've got to look at it like Carrollton is in Denton County uh that's true that's true you know you know and it gets kind of scary you know when you're looking at Lewisville you're looking at Denton you're looking at you know some of the larger cities and and Lewisville had more crime this last year than any of them and yeah it's just getting it's just getting really scary and almost uh out of hand you know there's been uh i don't know if you've heard any but any of it on the news lately or not but there's been a couple of uh you know uh a few months ago there was a deal in North Dallas where they had the man taking little girls out of their bedrooms breaking into their bedroom windows yes oh yes i was living up there when all that mess was happening at that time there's been a couple of those here in Lewisville over the last few weeks yeah and they're you know they're not sure if we're working with the same guy or not but uh it's really scary you know it really is so is there yeah yeah it is what are things like you said McKinney do you live in McKinney too are things pretty calm up there or yes we uh oh yeah it's it's deader than a doornail up here we've only lived around my husband was uh transferred up here from uh yeah the North Building we're to um so it's we've been up here for about eight six or eight months an it's a lot different than Dallas yeah uh-huh oh yeah yeah i grew up in i went to high school in Frisco and lived there several years so i was up you know pretty close to where you guys are and and it was always uh-huh yeah i don't know Frisco there always seemed to be a lot of drugs in Frisco for as small a town as it was there were a lot of drugs really oh uh um but as far as major crime there didn't seem to be as you know one of those nice little small towns and nothing ever happened and it would be nice to kind of get back into that so um-hum yeah i don't know i just don't know as a matter of fact i had uh one of these conversations the other day where our topic was uh capital punishment and you know the death penalty and you know what you know we were talking about that oh yeah uh-huh and one of the things that we kind of got to talking about is you know what is it we can do you know what can what can be done to stop it and i'm not sure that i know the answer to that question yeah i don't know that one you know i mean one of the things that we talked about that i truly believe is you know you give somebody a you know a jury convicts somebody and they give them a sixty year sentence and the guys going to be out in twelve or thirteen years you know if if that long yet they oh it's very wrong it's horrible you know i have i take a business law class um on Tuesday nights and my instructor is a practicing criminal attorney yeah um-hum and you know so he does this like everyday you know deals with this and he said you know you could pretty much if you sit on a jury know right now you could be sure that they will serve just about a quarter of whatever you give them you know oh yeah why is that why is that well they they say we don't have enough room in the prisons and we've got to get them out well if that's the case let's come up with some money somewhere i know yeah to build some more and keep these people in i mean there was a thing on TV the other night where they were interviewing it was it was a women's prison and they were interviewing these women and these women are like they asked them is this a deterrent and they all said no of course not i mean we're going to be out in a couple of years this is no big deal i mean this is like a little vacation we don't have to work we don't have to you know we don't have to worry about making a living you know we're fed and we're clothed and we're you know this is no big deal and yeah yeah don't have to do anything and you know they were asked you know well when you get out will you commit that same crime again and they said probably you know this is how we live that's how we make our living we live by selling drugs we live by stealing we live by this you know yeah yeah yeah so obviously the system's not working you know an uh and i don't know what to do to make it work and so you know no no it's not oh it it's it's too it's too hard to enforce the capital punishment it takes it it's all all this automatic appeal stuff it just drags it out for years and years and years right years and years that's something we talked about too you know if you and then people forget you know they you hear oh this person's going to be put to death but you don't they don't tell you what this person has done what this person had done ten years ago the brutality of their crime exactly exactly yeah killed five children or something like this and and and you don't get to hear that part oh that kind of wears off with time and people's outrage slowly goes away and you know mine doesn't i know what you're saying no mine doesn't either but with specific yeah but with specific cases people but you know the names aren't familiar anymore and oh that's true that's very true you know people don't remember the what happened and they don't remember the outrage they felt at the time you know that oh my God look what he did you know and yeah yeah they say they'll say oh he killed a police officer you know who has a wife and three children yeah yeah yeah they don't mention that part yeah that's exactly right there was a thing on the other night about they had this women uh her husband was a police officer and was killed oh i think brutally i mean this guy point blank just shot him in the head i mean just uh for no reason i mean he the cop pulled him over for like a manor minor traffic thing you know and yeah and uh you know they she was getting ready to go through the trial you know for this guy and you know they they asked her uh can you imagine they asked her if she wanted the death penalty and she said yes oh God wouldn't that be horrible of course uh-huh i do and i want to sit on the front row when it happens i want to be there i want to watch it you know and you can't blame her for feeling that vindictive you know i mean uh-huh no you can not and you know it showed her trying to explain to her children where daddy is you know and it was just oh it was just oh boy it was just horrible i mean this her little girl was like five and she was you know all of a sudden she started crying and said mommy i w ant my daddy and and you know her mommy said i know honey an oh and this little girl said uh yeah and they just can't grasp it said something about that man shot my daddy didn't he and the her mother said yeah honey the man shot your daddy and uh she said where did he shoot my daddy uh-huh uh and it was in the head and the mother said well we won't worry about that right now and she said i think he shot daddy in the face and mom said well you're right you know and she just started crying and it was just so sad you know i mean just i want to uh-huh yeah oh um and how a five year old can grasp something like that is beyond is just a uh no you an adult can't grasp something like that the enormity of it you know i mean i don't no i don't know and these poor children are going to be fatherless forever and this guy ought chances are he he'll be out he'll be walking the streets and it's just doesn't yeah will be out or uh or you and i are going to be supporting him for the rest of his life one of the two that's right that's right i don't know i just i know you know i look at some of the millions of dollars that we you know give to other countries every year um-hum yeah uh-huh and i know some of the i know those people i i mean i know they're people too and i know they deserve to have food to eat and water to drink um um-hum but i just want to say hey you know let's straighten out you know use that money and straighten ourselves out before we go trying to heal the world you know i mean yeah yes uh too much we give away way too much in my in my opinion oh we do we do we do it we really do and and i guess if if we would as a country unite and sit down and and if Congress received a millions of letters in one week saying we're not going to take this anymore um-hum you're either you know do away with some of these laws providing this or we're going to vote you out next time maybe something would happen you know but people don't get involved and don't sit down and do that so i don't know no people would rather hide their head and yeah and just not pay any attention to it yeah and not venture venture out their own front door than yeah well we're feeding starving kids overseas but we're not paying any attention to the ones that are starving next door you know it's really sad yeah it really is i heard something that their supposed to be starting a huge campaign in New York about um child abuse and stopping child abuse and it's supposed to be like it's starting there supposed to be like a big nationwide campaign and you know so hopefully that will take off and really do something i don't know there's just um-hum yeah that would be nice but you know it's like the big drug campaigns that you hear every once in a while they the big hype is at first and then it just kind of fizzles and dies yeah kind of fizzles out yeah that's true that's true and uh it's just it it's got to start at home is where it's got to start and um-hum uh it's but then there's so many people you get so many different opinions like well you shouldn't have well i shouldn't have to have to do this or i shouldn't have to do that and all this other stuff i don't want to get involved and um-hum and it just i chased a bunch of kids down on Easter Sunday we had put Easter eggs out in the front yard for an Easter egg hunt for you know my son and for his cousins and stuff and uh-huh and uh a bunch of kids came along and just started grabbing them stealing them i went running after them screaming hey you stop you stop i called the police uh you know i mean there was people that laughed at me they were Easter eggs then i called the police because i figured if these kids were stealing Easter eggs at ten that's theft that is theft yes um-hum they're going to be stealing cars at sixteen and robbing houses at twenty one you know if it doesn't stop yes well you've got to be held accountable for your actions no matter how old you are or what it is that's right these boys knew that what they were doing was wrong and when i screamed at them to stop they kept running they knew what they were doing was wrong that's why i called the police of course um-hum um um-hum to heck with them you know the police asked me if i wanted to press charges and i said no i'm not going to press charges i wanted the boys parents to know what had happened and i want you to go to talk to their parents and i want you know their their parents to be aware yes that now that's something that sure doesn't happen anymore boy when i was a kid if you did something to somebody else you got trotted over to that person's house and and you had to apologize to their parents and all this other kind of stuff well this is exactly what i told my mom you know when it was all over i said if we had a decent set of parents here those boys will be back here this afternoon with money to repay the eggs and with a big apology and nothing of course um-hum nothing of course nothing the one girl the boys ran i couldn't keep up with them but the one girl was like carrying a two year old on her back and i was able to keep up with her and follow her until the police police came you know so we would know who they were and her mother the police called her mother to come and pick them up yeah and her mother had the same attitude as she as she did they were convinced that the absolute only reason i called the police was because she was black it had nothing to do with the fact that she stole from me oh Lord and the little girl told me that the only reason you called the police is because i'm black and the little two year old sister she had with her she patted her on the leg and said see what happens when your black honey you'll live with this your whole life oh and i told her i said honey this has nothing to do with you being black i'd follow white kids that stole from me i mean stealing is stealing i don't care what color you are you think just because you're black you can steal and nobody's going to call the police that doesn't make any sense no ugh you know oh it was just horrible and then the mother's attitude the mother looked at me and goes well what is it that you want do you want me to pay you for your eggs or what you know it was that kind of attitude you know i mean it was just bad and i thought you know the parents went home and you know the kids oh  well how do you use your credit cards um i use them carefully i guess um yeah i uh i usually don't i usually use them to consolidate billing um-hum uh for convenience sakes but i usually just pay them off at the end of the month yeah especially what i do i don't i don't avoid the finance charges uh as high as they are yeah i don't uh ridiculously high don't you know i don't let them carry over you know i uh um-hum i've been lucky i guess i haven't had a bill big enough where i couldn't pay them off at the end of the month but i i try to try to live within a budget you know and so well so i keep that in mind i just don't you know i guess it takes self-restraint when you have a credit card to know that that there's really you really have to pay these things off yeah plus a lot more plus a lot more you know and you got to realize that there's only this much money in the bank and if you're going to live you know yeah well if you're not going to try to you know say well i'll pay it off sometime in the future yeah for so many years i was so deep in debt on credit cards and i finally dug my way out of them and that was enough to teach me you know you just i can do without them um-hum right some people have a rip theirs up just because they can't you know they can't resist them yeah i got rid of a lot of them especially the ones where i paid fees right uh i kept the ones that were free right and basically the same thing i use them if i'm running short of cash and there's something i want or sale a sale or um-hum when i travel i use them right i use them to float sometimes if it's near the end of the month and you know and you know i don't have a check coming in a few days yeah yeah yeah it's about i'll go ahead and and charge it knowing that the money will be there yeah that's what i do by the time the bill comes yeah if there's running into a cash short or something there's some things some purchases i make that i will do always on credit card just so i have a record of them just like when i take all my cats down to the vet i always pay that on credit card uh-huh right you know we go out to eat a lot of times yeah i don't like to carry a lot of cash with me hum-um i have so i just carry my credit card and and for things like that yeah as long as i know you know that i'm i'm not over doing it yeah it's a and yeah i have i have what i have two credit cards that's all i use i'm always getting stuff in the mail all the time yeah yeah i you are a preferred such and such and you are yeah you're you're already approved then it's back you're already approved to get i i uh for the longest time i i'd gotten rid of my gas credit cards and then all of a sudden i started getting a flurry of these things so i i did i have picked up three gas credit cards in the last couple months oh but uh sometimes they just send them to you and say here have a credit card yeah i have that one oh do you yeah yeah i just ripped i just cut it up and threw it away but you know oh you should have used it you wouldn't have been liable for the payment is that right yeah huh i didn't know that they yeah they send you card that that you didn't want that you didn't apply for it's yours is that right yeah huh of course they could always stick something in the credit bureau that's right that's right they could they can make your life miserable if they want to sure yeah i had a i had a tough battle with Exxon several years ago is that right uh and i i tore up their card and sent it to them and now i've got another one we don't have too many Exxon stations out this way oh really what do you got out there uh we've got lots of Mobil Mobils yeah Mobils are big and we have a few Exxon we've got some other ones like Citgo yeah yeah is a is a one yeah well i don't think i don't think we've got a Citgo here in Raleigh no matter of fact i know we don't yeah got some Shell stations um a few Texaco stations we have several convenience stores that sell Citgo gas but they're not Citgo stations i guess uh-huh right the biggies around here are Exxon Texaco and um well gosh that's about it BP i guess and there's another local one i can't i can't remember what there's some few Sinclair stations gosh i haven't seen a Sinclair station in years yeah the few they're the green dinosaurs are yeah their their gosh there used to when i was a when i was a kid there was a Sinclair station about three blocks away that's where i used to go to pump up my tires and get my flats fixed and all of that logo yeah there's not that many down here that you know once once in a while you'll see one yeah i guess they're still in business just barely i guess yeah yeah well just you ever you ever gotten in trouble with your credit card where they they've charged charged you for something you didn't didn't no uh i i've nope i've never had that didn't purchase i i did have a problem with American Express one time about ten years ago when i first got started in a business um yeah i have uh-huh they got my name of course um-hum and i said yeah this will be handy because i can use this for all my business expenses so i used it went on a went on a trip and used it got the bill and paid it about three weeks later i get this nasty letter from them saying you haven't paid you're overdue pay it right so i ignored it assuming that the things had crossed in the mail about two weeks after that i get a phone call right from someone saying say you are really overdue you need to pay this thing and i said what are you talking about i've already paid you and by that time the bank statement had come in and i had the canceled check uh-huh uh-huh so they said okay we'll take care of it two weeks later i get another nasty letter threatening legal action so i sent them a letter with a copy of the canceled check and their card cut up into about a hundred pieces i said here is your card here is the copy of my canceled check never send me anything else and never heard from them uh-huh somebody blew it but i just yeah i just you know i ain't got time to mess mess around with them right too many people want my money out there i don't have to pay somebody to take it right do you have the Discover card no i don't i i kept wanting i kept thinking about getting it but i just don't use the things enough to justify getting it either either do i they they i don't know i don't know how anybody can fall into this you get cash back and buy into that because um-hum all they're giving you back is a little bit of the interest you paid in that's right that's that's right you're paying you're paying a higher interest rate so they can rebate you two percent of it yeah their interest right their interest rate's twenty two percent um-hum higher than any other ones and then they said that we'll give you back some of your money hum that's right yeah right and in the meantime for that entire year they've got the use of that money uh like right uh yeah it's it it's a rip-off oh it is i there's so but a lot of people think it's wonderful i guess said they're they're doing well everything i've read they've been getting a more market share i guess they're they're advertising and promotions and well uh America's Americans are suckers yeah i guess so yeah i don't know they don't know how to sit there and look at the interest rate and say well this one is only sixteen percent and this one's twenty two hum yeah um-hum yeah i have a on my credit cards i have a grace period if i pay it off within when the bill comes i i don't have to owe any interest yeah i yeah right that's and uh i've only got i've only got two uh two cards now i've got a Bank of Scotland Visa and a Citibank MasterCard right um-hum and and that's it i mean i i don't need anything else now um-hum yeah once in a while uh my i have an American Express they have this a buyer protection thing um-hum where you they extend the warranty yeah so uh they both can be nice around Christmas time and stuff if you're going to buy a TV or uh or uh electronic yeah yeah something something like that then my roommate really believes in American Express he's got the green card or the gold card and the the Optima card and and everything huh he just he just thinks they're terrific uh-huh and i sit there and say yeah look what you pay for that every year he pays for that yeah a couple hundred bucks probably for that like high end card yeah gosh well if you have the money i guess yeah yeah i'm i'm thinking myself get what you pay for huh really yeah you know he's he's impressed because they send you this nice statement every i guess it's every year they itemize all your purchases and they break it down in little categories for you and all that uh yeah it's a nice report but is it worth you know is it worth sixty bucks a year for that little for that report right don't be crazy yeah uh when i was over in England i picked i picked up that uh Bank of Scotland Visa card and i i don't know hardly i don't ever use it except when i want to play the currency market um that's that's when it becomes handy because if i know that you know if the if the uh if the pound is high i can buy more dollar things um-hum for what i'm getting and then if if i think the rate's going to drop then i pay them back in less dollars right right right and it it's worked out most of the times i'm i'm usually pretty good on calling the the currency market uh-huh yeah a lot of people do that for a living i guess yeah trade trade money yeah i i did it when i lived over there i did it quite often uh-huh um and i really i really had a racket going because uh my paycheck was being uh electronically deposited here in the states and the bank that i banked with i could write them a check on an American bank and they would give me instant credit for it so uh-huh and and i and over and over the course of a year i i figured out how long it took them to clear that check and the and the shortest period of time was eight days so generally about eight days before payday depending on what the currency markets were doing i would go up and start buying i'd i'd start cashing in my checks for pounds hum right and then by the time the other check went through it the it the rate was either down or up depending on what i was doing and it it was great i mean i i could made a little extra money there huh yeah and i mean one day you know i might be able to get  okay well uh how do you feel about uh drug testing um personally i don't have a problem with it uh i think uh as far as uh protecting fellow employees protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do um it's justified on the other hand um i do agree that it's it's a it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work um i would never i would never have a problem with anyone testing me but i can understand why people would object so i guess uh i guess uh i'm kind of mixed on it still at this point yeah yeah i am too a little bit i mean i i don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing and and you know obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth but i don't really like having to do it um-hum that's right it and i don't like the idea of it it's it's makes too much of a big brother type of thing that's absolutely right it it uh i guess it all comes down to uh you know a a definition of uh how much out outside activities affect your work and uh uh granted you know any any kind of drug use on on company property and whatnot is is definitely not acceptable uh uh i don't think anybody would ever argue that or uh yeah hum-um any any after affects carrying over into the workday but um you know i i don't i'm not particularly concerned with what people do um after they leave for the day especially if i don't if i don't uh see any results of it the next day yeah yeah i think so too but you know it's one of those things well it it is it you know on the other hand you you've got uh you've got the uh the possibility of people oh you've got some people could be arrested for uh drug use drug dealings and things like that and uh if their if their employers name hits the papers and that it's it's it's a mark against them the company and uh you know what kind of people work there what uh yeah plus i guess if they are in trouble enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time then the company has lost what they've put into that employee and their expertise or whatever that's right that's right right even even if it is you know a company policy of uh immediate termination or whatever they still have to replace them yeah and uh there's there's a lot involved there well do you think that um it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it i think i think the regular schedule stuff um that when you say everybody get out of it that's a good point i never really thought of it that way well you know if if they have time enough they can yeah they really can um i think the big the biggest problem i've got is is forcing it on someone after they've already stay off of it agreed to the terms of employment um as far as the new hires i i hired on just early enough that i i missed it um where the new hires were concerned but uh yeah not nobody no i don't think anybody questions that um testing someone as a as a as a pre condition to being hired but um for the conditions of employment to change while you're on the job that's i i don't know that that's where i think that most people get upset it's uh yeah it it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically and uh yeah it's just it it's a really tough question and it you know it people have have really quieted down after everything started but i still think there's a lot of there's a lot of resentment i think so too uh i know the the group i was in at the time this all came up they uh were quite vocal about it uh through electronic mail boy they just really uh-huh you know let them have it from one end to the other vehemently but uh it has quieted down but i don't think they probably feel any differently and some some of them did quit the company you bet no that's right yeah i i know of some people who did uh it was it was indirectly related you know they could always come up with other reasons but it it had a lot to do with it just uh the the whole attitude because it's really uh it's just really it it seems so unTI you know with the the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have um to all of a sudden true uh start forcing attitudes and whatnot you know there's not a lot of pressure to to vote the right way or anything else around TI like there like there is in some companies or at least you know from what i've heard but uh um-hum yeah i wouldn't like anything of that nature you know don't tell me what to do you know yeah um-hum no absolutely absolutely not you know it's it's it's if you know if you hired me i'll be you know supposedly you agreed with a majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with so uh you know let's let's stick with that original trust i guess huh yeah but uh it's it's still it it still remains a tough question and it's there's a lot of you know the whole the whole department of defense uh reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot there's a lot of different things that uh come into play but that was i think everybody everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company yeah well i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem then that would be one thing but i think it's too minor and too um-hum you know in in the whole scope of things this isn't going to to have any real affect on what's going on on the street i really don't think so yeah i really don't because some people are going to are are going to risk it um it may prevent i i guess i guess what i'm trying to get at is if it if it if it does help a few individuals maybe maybe it's worth it um you know it may prevent somebody who was was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot but uh yeah i don't know if you know the it's it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much there there's still a big question in my mind that the the absolute refusal to accept the possibility of of mistakes on the testing is something that still bothers me it it's well yes that yes i i think that could be a big problem you know i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasn't you know that just really rub me the wrong way um-hum um-hum absolutely and that i i don't know if uh i don't know if everybody understands all the implications on that too even even if you you know if you take uh a a drug that was prescribed prescribed for you but the the prescription has run out you still had some left and you happen to take an extra penicillin well penicillin's not on the list but you know yeah i i think you understand what i'm getting at it it can still show up and it can still flag as a positive and and those kinds of things obviously that's not the intent yeah yeah right no and uh those are the kinds of things that still can show up i guess the one that really got me too was that uh let's say your spouse is on a particular drug and you know what that is and then you end up with the same problem and you take their leftover medicine that's not allowed um-hum that's right you know that's that's totally out that's right i even had friends when i was going to college who were in uh who are in pharmacy school and they could legally um provide medicine to their family mens family family members and friends certain medicines were were legal now i i i believe you know any of the any of the ones we would we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists but uh um there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications and that can happen but uh uh-huh oh that's interesting well well i guess we've exhausted that one yeah yeah i think so you too good-bye enjoyed talking to you good-bye  some of the political trends that have started up uh i guess in the other side of the ocean as it were some of the uh okay revolutions and desires for change that's going on over there when that first started going on there was a politician in the US i don't even remember his name but uh he made a a not so widely publicized comment that said just wait awhile and see how much US aid ends up going that way um-hum his and he thought or predicted that Poland would be one of the first ones to start seeing uh both in forms of debt forgiven and uh actual dollar values given over to them and they took a little while but sure enough some of that stuff is coming about uh so i don't know if that's going to be an ongoing trend that we're going to start helping this country and that country and breaking our own backs as it were what do you think well i think that's uh a you know valid observation that uh anytime that a company that a country appears to be uh moving in the same direction that the United States uh thinks is the right direction that they tend to get more you know more uh more aid from from our government then they would have before or the other governments do um i suppose that's a uh as valid a way of determining who gets aid is as anything although i'm not sure that uh us giving aid is the right uh right thing for our government to be doing um-hum um i i think it's kind of ironic that from my you know from my observation anyway that that we're uh rewarding other governments for becoming more democratic in following more capitalistic approaches whereas in our own economy the trend seems to be more towards social programs um-hum and you know away from the capitalistic approach so it's kind of like you know we're moving in the in a kind of a direction toward each other yeah that's interesting uh you know i i mean that's my own observation anyway yeah i think you're right i think over the well goodness i guess you could go back as far as Roosevelt and say that the social programs have certainly gone up and only economics have caused a few cutbacks but still the desire seems to be that the government say right right yeah or the norm has become that they would desire that the government say yeah that we deserve this so you will provide this right this is part of the old happiness aspect yeah that's a that's an interesting thought that they're headed to be a socialist and they're headed to be democratic and maybe we're capitalist and maybe the two will meet in the middle and and and agree i i don't know and i'm not sure that uh that i would even think at this point that somewhere in the middle would even be desirable because uh i mean if there's if there's something uh if what we wind up with is more socialistic than what we have now then i'm not sure that it's the right thing it's there i think we have too much too many social programs um-hum uh it's a social programs without the corresponding responsibility i guess is right that does seem to be a problem that even the Poles faced when uh i think they're one of the earliest experimenters in in trying to get a capitalist uh economy going and some of the things that showed up is um i hate the term worth it work ethic but that seems to be the one that's tied to it right that some of the Poles just didn't know what it meant to get up in the morning and you know be there and put in a few extra hours if it needed it or you know a little bit of work here and work there do what it takes instead of just stamp the clock stamp the clock and forget about it give me my paycheck um-hum right um though there are jobs of course that exist that way here uh they don't they don't they're not labeled CEO you know they're they're uh assembly line type jobs and um-hum they didn't have that worth it ec ethic and here we're headed towards socializing to the extent that there's a whole welfare population that doesn't have it right oh i so but that's an interesting uh merging as it were of the two ideas we're going one way and they're going the other i noticed in uh an article in the paper where i didn't read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that there's a a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners that the uh the output of the American worker is on the decline you know pretty severely but uh um-hum the output's really suffering and i think that's you know that's another indication that that we're headed in the wrong direction right uh you know and i think uh i think rewards for a job well done are are are necessary and i i think that we i guess we have a tendency to as you know as managers of companies or owners of companies they have a tendency to try to get as much out of the employee as they can and not give as much as they can right you know in return i uh i i think that that there there needs to be some give and take in both you know on both sides of the of the picture there i don't know if it'd be a political trend or not to to uh consider the problem of the well i guess it it is a matter of uh at least the government's causing it there's there's so much more paperwork in most every job i mean the poor teacher can't get their jobs done for the reports and the things that the government requires and right right and uh the whole defense industry issue of having so many layers of management just to handle the paperwork and well uh you know even the police uh have a lot of paperwork to do uh i observed a uh i didn't actually see the accident but uh the the aftermath of a three car accident yesterday here in Richardson and i was going into the public library and apparently the accident had just you know recently happened then but there was a policeman there policewoman there um-hum uh taking down the information and i was in the library a good thirty minutes and came back out and she was still sitting in the police car there you know the accident right participants were gone but she was sitting there filling out paperwork you know so you know it took her thirty minutes plus to to handle one traffic accident hum yep the more cars the merrier the paperwork and uh right and you know i think that's uh just a a kind of an indication the paperwork the the amount of information that the government wants even about a traffic accident you know is so much that uh yeah you know we get bogged down and things like that i wonder if they waive that when uh some of these horrendously large pileups occur in California like you hear these twenty and thirty pile yeah boy couldn't you imagine doing the paperwork on that'd take an army of officers just to do the paperwork correct yeah uh okay well that just sounds like i got another phone call trying to come in so anyway it's been interesting thank you all righty i'll let you go then um bye bye  okay okay now when you babysit what age group children do you sit with well gosh all kinds um mostly between the ages of two and ten um last like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer and i mean they became like my children uh-huh i'd think so and um and they live in an apartment complex so we swam a lot and we played on the playground a lot and we would go to a movie on Thursdays and um there was always an activity you know they had their favorite TV shows and things like that that we watched and then we took naps and um i don't know it it just seems like there was always something to do children are so full of energy uh-huh and oh they were they just they they just keep you going now was this a one parent or two parent family uh one parent one parent how much time did she spend with them yeah she's just not much at all i mean i would get there at eight o'clock in the morning the children usually weren't awake by then and she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon uh-huh and they would have dinner and then it was time for them to go to bed uh-huh um now at this particular time the children were two and six but then i also i've been babysitting this child uh for about eight years he's nine now and um you know i've watched him grow up and he's like a little brother to me uh-huh and it's changed over the over the years um we get along a lot better now that he's older and uh we do different things now we used to play ball a lot but now it's he likes to watch TV and he's into wrestling and um i kept him on Friday night we went see we went to go see a movie and um things like that but i feel like i don't know when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them do you now you say your you go to school uh-huh i go to LSU and what are you studying uh communications well sounds like your getting a lot of experience in communicating with children oh yeah i mean i love children um i don't know seem when i was growing up my Mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high and i don't it would i think it was very beneficial to us i mean like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books and we went skating a lot and uh-huh you know she was just always there for us but nowadays if there are two parents to a family the mother works just as hard as the father does and the children either stay at home and get into trouble or they're stuck in a day care and i just i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that all my friends they their parents worked all the time they got to stay at home by themselves and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things like i couldn't ride my bike across the street but they could because they're Mom would never know it but now i realize that it was better because uh-huh yeah um they have got into a lot of trouble uh-huh because of lack of supervision well that that certainly can happen now if you you say you're in communications uh what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to uh-huh well i'm majoring in uh public relations public relations so so you would have a job with a company yeah yes ma'am rather than uh radio or television or newspapers or what have you right uh-huh and uh then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home and with or stay with the children well i would like to uh stay at home with my children for at least the first five years uh-huh but what what i plan to do in the future is um go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters and work on my doctorate and teach um college uh-huh uh-huh and in that case then i'll be i'll be at home when my children are at home but i'd like to stay at home with them until they get in at least into kindergarten uh-huh where they're at school from what eight to three or something and then i would be at my school teaching uh-huh uh-huh and um well that that's uh is an advantage of being in the education field i spent thirty four years in education oh really yes and so oh i started out with college and then went to high school and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college because you have a closer relationship with the uh students what grade oh did you what did you teach that i taught physical education oh oh i started out as a PE major uh-huh in education i wanted to be a PE teacher i sure did well i uh i found that uh it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time oh yeah and uh and it worked out fine from that standpoint uh plus the fact that uh when i left uh usually uh my husband was seldom home for maybe forty five minutes or so and then our son he had to get on the bus and he did get on the bus it was his responsibility and he never ever thought uh-huh of uh not going to school he said in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school because uh i uh well i i was in physical education then and i just kept getting pushed into administration wound up in administration absolutely oh and so he thought surely that i or i would have bought a hot line to know if he ever skipped school which of course was not the case and i wouldn't have checked on him however uh there are there are points both directions in that uh from the standpoint of parents working and not working yeah uh i listened to more than one parent say i don't know what this child wants i'm working two jobs they each have their own television they each have their own telephone they each have their own rooms they each have this they each have that i'd say but what they don't have is you that's right they need some attention absolutely and uh acting out because that is the way of getting attention well see whenever my Mom stayed home with us we did without a lot i mean we were it's hard to make it on one income but we did and and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years and um that's right huh you know we we only had one car we only had one telephone you know we didn't get to eat out all the time but i i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar uh-huh right and um i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up and i hope that i can provide that for my child too and we certainly uh we need more of that we need more parents willing to supervise though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure from the standpoint of of uh church and school and everything along the way oh we have and that i think has contributed much to uh the delinquency that works grant and the poor school results that we're having uh that the students uh parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one two and three to get the students off to a good start let them have positive um uh experiences from the lower levels so they want to continue learning and uh keep going and not wait until they're they're in the ninth and tenth grades it's too late then you cannot reverse that trend at that point uh-huh it is it's way too late i agree right and uh while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point and that is just as valuable it is at that time as to the rush in the elementary yes right because all the peer pressure it starts in high school and the parent really needs to be there for the child right and uh the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something uh we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football and i did keep statistics for his team and his Dad did take movies of the football oh great team and movies of the basketball team and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time yeah so what i feel that i learned a great deal from my students uh with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents and a thing such as uh one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors uh was um caring their parents say when i was your age i didn't have this or that and i know i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people uh-huh well i guess that was good that you were you were hearing it from other students yes and i had to deal with their problems and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect and our son would share this and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of of uh lines well um so that i think he benefited from my experiences does your son work for TI no oh no he uh works uh for a different company yeah in the Dallas area but when he went away to college and he was on an allowance from the time he was in the seventh grade and uh a small allowance and all the way through college and he held three jobs while he was in college and we didn't even know it he didn't even tell us uh that he had three jobs but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account oh goodness and uh we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go if he got married he was on his own if he flunked out he was on his own  well Stephanie what's your position on gun control well on a scale of one to ten uh being ten no kind of legislation and zero being uh total ban i probably would lean more towards six or seven um i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals um-hum um i lived in Massachusetts for two years and they have a total ban on guns and i saw that it didn't stop crime in that state now was that just on handguns or was that on rifles any any kind of firearms really yeah uh it's there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught um with a firearm and also i think there was a fine and that didn't help at all no i don't the the crime is not any better or any worse i mean it's huh i i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse but it certainly didn't get any better um-hum i usually just i'm trying to think of i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the the like three uh-huh where i don't think you should should necessarily ban guns any by any means but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature uh you know you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one and you know right off the shelf yeah i i i agree with that i i think that the law the law is on who can buy a gun are are way too lax i think that i think that the and but uh-huh exactly and so i think that kind of control is would be good yeah but the uh i you know i'm trying to think of how many times you you make the statement and and just to kind of exam it a little bit and i i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true uh only the guns were in the hands of the criminals but how many times i guess i have never heard of a a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun um i and maybe they just don't report those or i'm not sure or you know i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed but good thing they had their gun on them and they they thwarted the robbery attempt yeah i i'm i'm not really sure i don't personally i don't own a gun um and i don't think i probably ever would um-hum um although i would like to know how to handle one and i think it's good that everybody and i think everybody should learn how to handle one um-hum um you just never know when you might come into contact with one true um did did you were you brought up in a family that hunted or no no uh nobody in my family hunted uh my father had had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in Massachusetts we lived in New Hampshire at the time how about that and he moved to Massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns so we ended up uh with these guns and my really my only experience experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right huh um-hum and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere oh jeez and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns and it it kind of scared me right um-hum but i think that if i learn how to use one i would i would feel better right i've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know if you ban guns you're just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of that's done with rifles and such uh though there's you know probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately yeah you know if they had to have a rifle or was you know made it more difficult to get a a uh a handgun now of course you know in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want yeah that's true but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and you know temporarily a little bit uh offset or off keel i don't know if that's a large percentage percentage of uh crime or not but i guess it would be some but i i think definitely like today they just introduced the what's called the Brady bill the seven day mandatory waiting period on getting any guns and i think that um-hum i would definitely support that shoot that's a good idea yeah i i i agree i the thing that scares me uh though about where i would i would want definitely want some sort of legislation and coming from the north east i'm just not used to seeing um these and i i know this may sound kind of stereo typical but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks oh sure that's kind of scary to me that kind of to me it is more like vigilantism uh-huh you know and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on in L A on the freeways and then you come here in in the Dallas area um right yeah that's crazy i don't i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles yeah that's kind of kind of wild um especially not in the back window uh-huh for everybody to see that is kind of wild well that's all very interesting well thanks for talking sure you're welcome okay bye-bye good-bye  okay what kind of music do you like well i um several years ago a radio broke in my car and i never i got out of the habit of listening to the radio and so um-hum i haven't been listening i i used to just listen to the rock stations but um lately i have been going back to classical music i don't really know what um-hum too many of the most popular songs are unless you know they're in the the news or something but um so i tend to listen to some of the older um-hum songs that were popular back when i was paying attention and then i like some classical music and some of the um-hum um-hum pieces that have been around a while i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music what about you um i listen i listen to a wide variety of music sometimes i'll turn on the classical music sometimes i'll listen to jazz uh every now and then country and western um um-hum i'll listen to some of the rock stations i also like the uh the the classic rock stations that play the older more mellow type uh-huh rock music um some of the some of the rock stations now are the i guess the top forty stations or whatever they just it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials and um-hum sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that that's true um-hum so lots of times i'll just play cassettes instead of listening to the radio actually but uh most of my cassettes i guess i don't i don't like hard rock no um i have some some rock and some jazz and couple of maybe one or two country and western some uh oh i can't believe i can't think of his name um Garth Brooks i have a couple of his tapes uh-huh and um but it's mainly it's mainly just the the light rock type stuff yes i don't i never liked any of the heavy metal music i never really listened to it because i you know i prefer to have more i guess an established pattern of um-hum music to listen to but and i back a long time ago when the rap music first came out it was kind of a novelty and i listened to some of it but i you know now that there's just a million rap groups and um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh they try to tend to try to do outdo each other with raciness i think and oh yeah so i you know i'm not attracted to that at all but um it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was a easy access and so now that i do have one i just don't automatically turn it on um-hum unless there's something i'm particularly listening to but you know if you go two or three years without having that what i got the most exposure to um-hum it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from just having a you know easy access to current music and so i did like i say tend to go back to albums and cassettes and things that i had already had purchased but we don't have a CD yet do you um-hum um-hum no i don't i sure don't because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like gosh i have to go out and buy a CD player and then start collecting CDs and it just i haven't gotten around to doing it yet uh-huh yeah i i kind of decided to wait until it it was around a while it was kind of like remember when personal calculators first came out and they were really really expensive and then now you can get one for two or three dollars yeah yeah just like VCRs too yeah i thought of that too that if i wait it'll get a lot less expensive and i can do without it for a while uh-huh uh-huh sure and also they get better quality with and they learn to have more features and things and without and making them less expensive so we're kind of waiting um-hum um-hum to like uh now you know and the price of cassettes has gone down because CDs are so popular so um-hum that's and a CD is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was too right now i think i haven't even priced them i guess they must be they're somewhere between ten and fifteen dollars a piece oh really that is awful yeah yeah i bought some at Christmas time for friends of mine that have CD players i thought my gosh now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a CD player for a while uh-huh take our time well i can't imagine um you can't record on them and so right they won't be as functional as like a cassette player where if you heard something you could record it you know uh if you have i guess if you wanted to record something to play out in your car or something that you'd heard or that you owned an album of so CDs won't be nearly as handy um-hum uh-huh yeah see i've got a on my stereo i've got a a uh turntable and then i've got a dual cassette so i can record off other cassettes um-hum but i never realized you couldn't record onto CD i just never really thought about it because i haven't really looked into it very much i don't have one and and i've never really looked at one very closely but that that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car now i guess uh-huh you know one of these days when i get a new car maybe i guess all of them probably will have CDs players by then but uh i'm not planning on doing that for a while i just got mine paid off so i'm going to stick with the cassettes and and uh you know until yes enjoy it until they now my sister my younger sister has a she does have a CD player that she got for Christmas and she's got the the cassette so she can record off cassettes onto CDs i mean i'm sorry other way around off CDs onto cassettes um uh-huh uh-huh well that's good so i can record some things from her and you know get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to but um-hum but um i just haven't gone to CD yet why we haven't either but we you know we like the the idea of having great um extra quality you know in your music and things but but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to not have to think about the great financial um-hum um-hum sacrifice that that would be to suddenly try to switch over to all CDs or something but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is um-hum when we had children um i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching and what kind of music i was listening to and activities because um you know i just didn't want them to be exposed to right um-hum a lot of things and a lot of the lot of the songs have some lyrics that um i just wasn't pleased with you know oh yeah and they get worse and worse too um-hum and so i really think we've tried to tone down um-hum our taste there to make uh you know our children not be exposed to so many negative negative things so early in life um-hum well that's amazing how i used to when i was in college i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on MTV or something but ever since i've been out of college um-hum i guess over the last several years i listen to the stereo less and less now i will turn on i've got a small jam box in my bathroom i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do and it's kind of boring standing there putting on makeup so i'll turn the radio on and uh-huh right and then i listen to it when i'm in the car driving to work because again there's you know there's nothing else going on i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work but other than that i've i really don't right i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore yes i know what you mean i i know my husband he um plays an instrument and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school and so he has a lot of all different kinds of music and he goes out of his way to play marching band music or um-hum um-hum like you say jazz or classical to the children to to give them some exposure to different kinds of music and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds and um-hum that's good what instrument does he play he plays the it's a euphonium it's like a small a really small not a tuba but i think it's hard to explain i never had known anyone to play one before but it's kind of like a small small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder um-hum uh-huh i've never heard of that uh-huh but it's a cross between a tuba and and an and you know a horn it's a brass instrument um-hum so he plays that and and a little bit of piano and uh-huh but he has some real fond memories of marching band and um-hum concert band type activities and he thinks that'd be good for the kids um-hum oh i'm sure it is i'm sure it is i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger i my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years and um-hum so i was i was a real good piano player but then i got interested in a lot of other things and i got real involved in many things and and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything i could sit back down and play a few things but not like i used to be able to it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away um-hum um-hum and i took guitar lessons i think for one or two years and uh that was about the same time i was taking piano and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework  um so do you have a personal computer uh well we do have one in in our home uh it's on the fritz right now because the monitor isn't working properly but uh it has been uh used tremendously mostly by my children for uh playing games oh however um you know the bane of our existence these days uh but it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for reports reports and papers and that sort of thing yeah that's what when this subject was mentioned to us i said well i went gee that's all i use mine for is a word processor and i haven't used it since i got out of college and that was six years ago oh wow but it it was my sister's who my sister bought it uh-huh and uh my father had a small business and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business and he never did he always did everything out by hand he only had three employees so oh oh yeah you know it wasn't really worth it to him to do to do it yeah actually it would be worth it if he were able to get a program that would do something that he normally had to do by hand yeah like pay the payroll and yeah basically payroll exactly and there are lots of them on the market yeah but you do have to research that find out what works for your system what kind do you have um it's an IBM i think it's a Professional Three Hundred no that's that's the digital one it's an uh IBM PC Junior i think oh well that's a nice computer yeah she she uh she uses it now uh my sister to actually she moved and my father wasn't using it she took it with he uh-huh so she took it with her yeah don't blame her because she needed it to do she just finished up her Bachelor's degree so i don't know if she's going to even use it anymore it it's uh-huh yeah oh well well encourage her to try other things because um i am uh i work in a school system and i teach writing and we use the computers a great deal for word processing uh you know because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer as you probably found out yourself yeah but um i also am sponsoring a literary magazine and we're doing our entire layout on the computer uh because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have a publishing program oh yeah that's that's neat that's a very good use so it is wonderful once you get into some of the programs that are out now you can do so much with them yeah that you don't do until you really make yourself use them well i know there there's got to be a lot of uses but it's just you you have to have a need you have to make yourself do it yeah yeah but you have to have a need i really have no need for it at all um i work for Digital Equipment and we have a powerful computer down at work yeah uh-huh oh so you don't need a personal one no and i i still really don't do that much as you say play games on it yeah yeah yeah they're great for playing games my brother right well my son is uh studying electronic technology and he's been able to do things on uh on the personal computer here that really have enhanced his um reports and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way yeah um and i guess it if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful but um unless it is i guess it's kind of a waste i know some people who just they just went through a course uh and took the electronic grafting course oh that's fascinating uh-huh drafting not grafting but drafting course the CAD yeah i knew what you meant yeah yeah and that's really neat i mean yeah you can do graphs graphs on it too but this is you know this is one step above it but it's actual um drafting and i always yeah yes you can do wonderful design it it's really well especially when anyone who's ever done any kind of drafting or engineering uh drawing drawing um you have to be so precise yeah and the computer does it all for you yeah so it was really neat i wanted to go to that course but my boss wouldn't pay for it i'm like i'll get a job some day and my boss will pay for it i'll be needed oh well yeah because um i i i didn't want to go do it myself because i didn't think i was really going to use it uh-huh i got this cough i've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on oh boy what a change huh yeah it was bad yes it was a big change yeah you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot and then again i picked up a cold right but i'm doing all right getting over it well that's good so i don't i don't even know how much um personal computers cost nowadays well they vary tremendously um because you can get because you're they're uh the ones that were made a few years ago uh have come down in price significantly um you can get them i've seen them for five and six hundred dollars but they're much less um have much less memory and capable of much less yeah they can't do your um your drafting and your graphs and all of that no you can't do very much on them right right um well it's just that you have to have uh you have to be able to get your program in and and many many of the programs are so big uh they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work you don't have any bytes left but um if you um yeah if if you want to go into one that's really useful you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much and and we've ours is not quite that powerful and so you know we are we are limited which may be one reason why you do run into you do run into limitations on yours oh wow oh yeah uh-huh some things we can't do but but then we haven't needed to either you know um but we've been able to do what we can yeah wow that's neat that you even you even reach the limits of yours i haven't even begun to reach the limits of it i've no but i mine is not as good as a PC uh yeah junior yeah uh Junior yeah yeah ours is a Commodore 128 yeah and it it's not quite as um as useful not quite as powerful yeah so they say that Commodore has made a good um PC for the price though they did yeah that's very true that's very true they did very competitive i don't even i don't even know much money my sister spent on hers but i i just thought i it's it's going to be a waste she's not going to do it not going to use it sounds like he that you were right oh well yeah well she likes it she gets to write her reports but like i say she could have bought a much cheaper model and done what she wan ted yeah and she could have bought a typewriter also yeah a typewriter with memory would would have been fine it's all she ever uses it for yeah yeah um i think it might have a spelling editor on it i'm not sure um yeah it yeah it probably if she if it doesn't she could easily put it on yeah yeah that's one of the one great thing about it yeah right right which program did you use did you use Word Perfect um no i i really don't it's it was six years ago she pretty much set it up she goes here this is you make your file and then you can uh edit it right oh yeah um i used the one the one at work a lot um matter of fact anything i've had to write from now on i had to God forbid write a couple of resumes and i was just great and all you have to do is just put it in a uh the spelling check mode and i don't even have to look my my words up anymore uh-huh yeah they're great you're right well i guess we've spent our time i need to go help my daughter do something so oh okay good this has been fun talking to you okay yeah well bye good luck uh bye-bye  i guess i don't don't really have a problem with capital punishment i'm not really sure what the exact uh specifications are for Texas i know that they uh have capital punishment for certain crimes and that's probably the way i feel about it is is uh it kind of depends on the crime that's committed my belief all my life i guess has been that that if you take someone else's life then you automatically are giving up uh yours in place of it but i don't seems to be a lot of controversy about that yeah uh uh i tend to agree with you uh you know probably pretty similar views on it but that's that's one of the things i don't don't understand is is so much of the controversy because uh you know i i do also myself believe in capital punishment uh uh you know it it really irks me to see so much effort put into preventing someone being put to death by the State when they so callously and usually so you know without even thinking or without any concern uh you know end somebody else's life and in a lot of cases several people's lives that's true i guess well there's there's probably two or three different types of of views as far as the controversy goes i can see where if a life was taken by accident or uh i don't know what you'd call it not premeditated or i guess primarily by accident uh there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for but i lean towards if it's premeditated or if it's uh oh is that kind of a habitual or or a habit that uh a tendency that people uh may get into then i guess i don't really have a problem with it yeah that's that's kind of the way i feel if if you've got a guy who's who's been to trial and has been in and out of jail you know basically a a three time loser for the twelfth time you know and he goes out and kills somebody he's not going to be reformed he's not going to get any better you know it's it's not going a it's just not going to get any better and and the only thing you know a lot of people have the opinion that you know don't don't have capital punishment but give them life in jail and you know i could go along with that if if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten or twelve years yeah yeah i think that's what aggravates a lot of people is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty and they wind up back on the streets after five years or six years or like the kid on the news tonight out in Mesquite who was out in six months um-hum yeah it's it's just our criminal system is just so i guess overloaded but the you know the the problem is not so much with the prison system you know i mean because the the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws and the prison system are just you know they're trying to cope with them but you know the thing about capital punishment i i you know a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent uh to to future crime and the way it is now it's not because you know you no if the like the State of Texas for example may uh you know may execute somebody twice a year you know that's that's no kind of deterrent because we we've got literally hundreds of people on death row and and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years on death row and that's right that's certainly no kind of deterrent and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it it's not a deterrent uh a deterrent because it's not no it's not you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after cre uh committing a crime are really pretty slim right now and you can probably spend uh a lot of time oh yeah uh or maybe eventually uh just waiting it out and that's where a lot of aggravation comes i think is is uh these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process they may spend years uh-huh uh-huh and you know the last i heard it was costing ten twenty thirty thousand dollars a year uh to keep these guys waiting yeah it it's amazing there's uh there's a girl i work with our secretary as a matter of fact her her father was murdered her father and three other guys up here in Sherman and the uh the guy that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death you know he's been on death row for like eight years yeah and you know this this was her father uh you know that that got killed you know just cold-blooded murder him and three other people and but still for some reason you know this this guy's sentence has not been carried out you know he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people and the State still can't bring itself to to execute execute this guy to yeah to carry it out it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system it does it really does you know she and they have to go back uh occasionally you know she has to write letters to the parole board and you know lawyers and just just ever so often she mentions well she's got to do something else you know write another letter or do something it's just yeah it should be over and done with yeah yeah you know she should be getting on with her life you know getting getting that part behind her but yet it's it's kind of tied to her the way it is now yeah it is and she winds up being a a victim day after day after day yeah yeah right a victim not only of indirectly of the crime but also indirectly by that indirect involvement it's just it's it's ridiculous right she she is she is an emotional victim yeah yeah it it's terrible you know and and you know the like you say the cops that are out doing the work day by day have got to have a lot of frustration when they see all their work basically go out the window yeah oh that oh man i i couldn't be a cop for that for that very reason you know because they do the the criminal gets right back out and you know the cop's just got to go back and and do his thing all over again because so many of the crimes are are done by repeat offenders it's yes they are well that's about five minutes so unless you've got something else well yeah no it's a pleasure talking with you all right Ron we'll see you later all right bye-bye okeydoke good-bye  okay what uh go ahead and tell me about your home well my my home at the moment is an apartment oh is that right yeah i work here in Germantown but i live in Pensacola Florida oh that's interesting so i own a home in Pensacola and uh let's see we are to compare homes correct okay yeah uh my home is well is typical for the area i live in a development uh it's a relatively i would say oh well God it sounds like sounds like i'm bragging no that's okay no it's upper middle class uh kind of an environment it's a okay two story colonial which my wife and i designed oh that's neat uh it has around thirty two hundred square feet wow that's large uh five bedrooms and so forth and so on and it is i would imagine in terms of of size and so forth it's relatively typical for the area it might be i would say it's probably midsized for the area there are some smaller and there are several you know several larger um-hum and uh but in based you know in terms of you know in in Pensacola in that area of Florida it uh it's what now it is uh probably ten years old oh well that's not too bad that's still fairly new yeah and so it's in terms of cost and and and size and so forth it uh the house you know housing there is extremely affordable and uh compared to other parts of the country you know let's say compared to Maryland that same house here would probably cost three quarters of a million dollars but well oh you're kidding well do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there i mean what it's i really haven't i really haven't uh when we built it ten years ago it was it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars okay so i i would have really i haven't really priced you know in the market so i huh it it sounds like i mean from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand um-hum i mean Dallas is a very marked up area although right now it's a lot lower um because of all the layoffs and everything the economy around here is real poor um-hum i thought that was on the upswing again now well no not really um-hum um the area itself uh the Fort Worth Dallas area um has become become kind of depressed because there's been so many layoffs with big companies including Texas Instruments um there's been tremendous amounts of of uh layoffs yes so really housing is real bad the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad but housing is still real bad um-hum well Pensacola has yeah it's really is a buyer's market there now and it isn't because of the well there is been a lot of speculative building yeah this is oh uh i don't know perhaps not in Dallas but uh i'm sure people in uh you know in uh Galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it uh Pensacola is a Navy town uh-huh and home porting was a possibility a few years ago oh they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the Navy a new carrier was coming in and uh wow the uh attendant uh support vessels well that's no longer so do you think it was overdeveloped then the case oh it's it is i mean the the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population wow and so uh overbuilding is it it has been a real problem there um so you can still get a get a a good good house for a very very reasonable price and i mean good i would let's say typical say three bedroom uh two and a half baths on a half acre or so of land uh reasonable construction would probably run you uh right now anywhere between somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars um yeah that's and probably perhaps cheaper depending upon the neighborhood so yeah what about your home that's well right now we're just renting but it is a home um um-hum it's a four bedroom home it has about i guess eighteen hundred square feet it's on one floor um-hum uh we have no basement i don't know if Pensacopla okay i wasn't sure most of the ones you know know up north and everything do but um anyway no nor nor do we but um it's uh it's pretty also pretty typical for the area most of this area was developed uh this house was built in seventy four um-hum so most of the it's almost twenty years old and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style uh we have a friend that lives two blocks over and his house is almost identical to us except his is three bedrooms and ours is four um-hum but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same so i i think most of them are there was it like most areas that are built um there were probably like two or three styles you could choose from right and and uh that's pretty much all the houses in the area uh for probably a square mile i'd say at least maybe even a little bit more than that w ell the housing here in Maryland is just atrocious and in in the entire DC area i'm i'm only about uh twelve miles or so from the uh border of Washington DC and Montgomery County Maryland is probably one of the most expensive where are you in relation to Sevren are you close to Sevren places to no we are west Sevren is East near the Eastern Shore if i had oh okay well i just my i have a sister that used to live in Sevren and they bought their home in i i want to say like around um-hum nineteen seventy five or something like that and they paid like they they had it built from you know they they designed it and everything and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand so i oh that's not unusual yeah yeah so i just wondered you know if the whole area was like that or well that's that area over there is not as expensive as in the the immediate you know Washington area um-hum and so we uh i was just looking for example there is a uh condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium and ninety two thousand dollars for two bedroom which is essentially a two bedroom apartment um now it was very nicely done yeah sounds like a lot of money though yes i i can't i can't envision spending that much money uh and for on on something along those lines so you know it's you i guess you pay the piper but yeah right plus the the the phenomenal taxes around here are phenomenally high uh oh yeah uh for the and so you on that it's not unusual for example for somewhere around here on a on an on a what we would you know what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house say for example in Pensacola Florida on that house with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes maybe maybe you know maybe a little bit higher than that now wow yeah that's but that same house here you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year taxes on it wow wow that's pretty so it's uh so the question of whether to buy here or move to another county say drive twenty more miles north buy a condominium for approximately uh the same price maybe a little lower but the taxes would be you know perhaps maybe one third uh of really that much of a difference uh wow oh absolutely you know so that's it's it's really sad yeah this is one this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country wow why is that do you know i mean well they it uh the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country um-hum uh and because the cost of living around here is so high public employees make great salaries around here oh well i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the Montgomery County Public Schools makes and and and i'm not this is uh the figure he makes eighty thousand dollars a year my goodness wow that's and i by administrator i i think i mean i they didn't they did not define it but for example a curriculum supervisor or principal or someone you know in that uh in that range  what kind of car do you drive now i drive a Honda Prelude and do you i drive a Honda Accord oh yeah yeah i bought mine a year ago so i'm not buying a car any time soon yeah me either i just bought mine uh it'll be a year in August yeah i love it though i love Hondas yeah it i think i found my car well i i like where all the controls are right they're they're in good spots and i i have an automatic i can't drive a standard oh really i have a standard yeah but um i it's and it's supposedly real reliable the only thing i've ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first yeah oh really i hadn't heard that yeah what did you have before you bought that i had a Buick Regal did you yeah i had uh Mazda RX seven before that and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life the Buick was was great it was nine years old and and it was still going strong the only really problems i had had with it in nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old really and that was the only major problem that i had i mean i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler and i had replaced the tires and yeah uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor right i never really had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years and that's that's a lot it shouldn't go out that much no hm and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the Honda but i don't think i'm going to do that again i think i'm going back to automatic now well i never well well i kind of know how to drive standard but i've never owned one so i hadn't i don't drive one a lot so i don't feel feel comfortable in traffic with it right right and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic yeah it is and that's true and resale value is really important to me yeah it is me too that's why i got the Honda Hondas have great resale value yeah yeah the Mazda definitely did not not at all they're worse than American cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes really i did pretty well with my uh Regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the the interior was still really nice there what'n cracks all over the dash board and stuff and yeah right and it had some some nice features so i ended up okay with the Buick good and i anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever i decide to sell it course i may never sell it right i may drive it till it's dead but yeah that's what i did with the Mazda drive it till the till the clutch went out and the wheels fell off so probably what i'll do again yeah yeah but i really like the Hondas i like foreign cars a lot um-hum yeah i looked at the Mitsubishi Galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the RX seven so long and it was so small uh-huh and it's really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the Galant and those were really nice and you can get them for a great price yeah but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so that's how i ended up with a Honda oh hm i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh i was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something so and she was gonna sell her car because she didn't need it anymore and it was only like a year old and i had never driven uh a Prelude so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of Prelude on their used car lot and i went and i test drove it right and you know i just fell in love with this brand new white Prelude oh yeah you know two liter SI with the the sun roof and the moon roof and i i bought it loaded they're nice i think oh yeah oh yeah i have to have them loaded i i love all those little things that you don't need but they're so wonderful i mean yeah yeah i went there looking at a used car and two days later i bought this car i i felt i felt like that was the worst impulse that was that was the largest impulse buy i had ever made the other the two other things that i've bought on impulse are VCR and a washer and dryer i go for the big stuff i would say yeah i noticed yeah mine was definitely not impulse i really needed a new car mine was just it's getting worn out i guess from being a sports car i drove it kind of hard yeah and i got it right after high school so by the time i traded it in it was ready ready to go yeah i got i got my Buick as a high school graduation gift did you yeah but i i guess this what'n really an impulse i mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for three years and i was just scared to right i was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for right that's same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself buy a buy a buy a used car sure like right i i was going to buy one once and i just i worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that just i can't seem to get over that that just bothers me i don't know why yeah well um like on Hondas they supposedly the maintenance records are supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff yeah that's true mean they can't stop you from doing it so hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced yeah yeah well and even if they didn't you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the blocks and everything yeah that's true so well i guess that's all okay well i enjoyed talking to you i enjoyed talking to you bye-bye bye-bye  oh i'm sorry it's okay you can get started there okay i think LA Law oh that's probably what i was going to say and uh Dallas i i'm a okay i'm a veteran of all of Dallas shows oh uh-huh it's very embarrassing oh yeah where where are you calling from Dallas Dallas yeah i'm from Rowlett oh okay i just moved here last April oh really and uh i got my husband i got i got married to a TIer and uh well the first thing my mom and i did when we moved out here was go to Southfork it was very embarrassing really i was going to ask you if you've been out to Southfork they have a museum there of all the Dallas uh uh people and they have they even have a a genealogy chart of all of the people who married who and whose children are whose and they even went so far as to put dotted lines on there as to who had an affair with who uh-huh huh it was pretty bad bad because i understood all of it okay i i can't say i'm that much of a faithful Dallas follower maybe it's because because i live here and i know how hokey it is i don't know one of my uh uh i went to school out in Plano and one of my my classmates married one of the uh uh one of the Duncans that actually owned Southfork when it started oh yeah so and i think she was in some of the shows for a while as extra and stuff so yeah that wasn't a very good thing that happened to that family yeah they kind of went in there and took over well what are you going to do they're they're coming to the end of their season uh well that's what i'm doing May third i'm going to sit right here watch it i was going to say there's going to be no more Dallas reruns actually i haven't watched it much this season in the last couple of years i've been on that uh downward trend yeah of course they're uh they're probably going to set it up for some kind of sequel or something in the future and uh yeah those TV movies or something yeah it's got to come back it was funny i i spent a a year overseas a few years ago and all the TV was i was in Japan and all the TV shows were in Japanese uh-huh but they showed reruns of Dallas and it was great because i could turn it on and all of the people were very familiar to me and i'd seen all of the shows so i knew what was going on so you didn't need to know the language huh-uh but it it was it was really nice when you move to such a foreign culture to see all these familiar faces how about that true and hear hear the weird voices yeah all those dubs it's terrible it like yeah somebody one time was talking about John Wayne movies with these weird Japanese voices and it's hard to imagine well what do you think about what's going on on LA Law this year it's well i have you seen it the past couple of weeks i can't remember the last time i saw it i know that um Susan Dey is with Jimmy Smits yeah and she's pregnant did you know that yeah and that just she doesn't belong with him and that they kicked Michael Kuzak out did you know that no he's not with the firm anymore no he uh the the i'm trying to remember Leland decided to extend Brackman's uh reign as a senior partner yeah and the rest of the partners all got up in arms about it and Michael met with them and said and said you know we got to do something about this we need to make a proposal let somebody else be the leader and he kind of elected himself and everybody else went along with it and they they uh gave it to Leland and he hit the roof and um he and Brackman talked about it and and Brackman decided to try and do away with him so he fired him because he he violated one of their policies of going behind a senior partner's back or something so they fired him they chased him off with the security guards they're fighting out that battle now he's firm formed his own firm really he uh what else did he do he did a lot of nasty nasty stuff behind their back yeah he stole Grace and Victor they've gone with him um wow and um who are the other two he stole two associates um the the tax attorney Abby and Jonathan he he took Abby and Jonathan with him yeah really yeah and he he went to uh he went to the bank and he took um i can't remember the guy the guy he defended for murder Earl you know they had a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills do you remember that the the black guy that yeah he was a teacher uh-huh yeah they they they put a lien against his house so he'd pay his legal bills because it was like three or four hundred thousand dollars or something whoa well Michael reduced his legal fees to twenty thousand dollars yeah so that they cut that out so they they couldn't have a lien on his house anymore so he did away with that and then he went to the bank because the bank gave him apparently some extra credit because they had that lien well s ince they didn't have the lien anymore they couldn't have the credit from the bank so that that got the firm in hot water oh and then then Michael went to court and and uh petitioned that they needed to go into solvency because they were so financially in bad shape uh-huh and uh they all showed up in court um Leland was going to try a motion make a motion before that so they ended up both being in court in front of the judge pleading their case and um i think i think Michael was doing it on the one hand and the guy that do you remember the guy that that uh Grace had an affair with the other lawyer that she had an affair with for a while kind of an older guy she at the firm no he wasn't at the firm he was like Rosalyn Chase's lawyer before oh it was earlier in the season she had an affair with this other lawyer no i guess i didn't see those and and anyway Leland Leland apparently has hired him on now and he's and he's defending this case jeez and what happened at the end is the judge um um uh Michael wanted wanted the firm put in receivership and the judge wouldn't do it but he said he he's going to give a like a ten day uh evaluation and he was going to put it in the hands of a businessman to to run it and see if the firm was salvageable or not uh-huh and and both parties had to come up with with lists of people that were suitable to to run it and he rejected both of the lists and came up with his own person you'll you'll never guess who this person is who think of the worst well now it might be hard but think of the the worst person that's been on the show uh-huh in in the past two years besides Rosalyn she's dead and gone yeah she's that was weird that was very weird um the worst person goofy i don't know you'll never get it it's it's uh was it Roxanne Roxanne the the secretary Roxanne's ex-husband David Meyer well he's got a lot of business smarts though yeah i know that's who he put in charge of the firm you i think what she did to him was a travesty yeah but he's going to be he's going to be running the firm for the next i don't know ten days or whatever to evaluate that's funny boy they've really got their uh talk about a genealogy chart yeah that's pretty pretty strange well they they've already said that um who is it i guess it's Susan Dey and and uh whoever plays Kuzak isn't coming back next year so some of this some of this has to do with why they're not coming back i guess yeah well is um the tax attorney and his wife still married married yeah they're going to stay there in fact um Susan Dey and and uh the the wife had had a confrontation about it oh why why they didn't invite them and and the the firm that Kuzak founded is just a litigation firm and they said well we wanted we wanted you but we didn't really want Stuart because he's not a litigationist and we didn't figure you you would come without him and and we're going to be fighting against each other so right oh so it's just kind of weird that that's a weird marriage yeah they're married in real life i know i know they've had i was surprised when they started having big problems and then i only caught part of the episode where he went on that uh nature deal uh-huh and and he got real into it i guess yeah yeah that was kind of bizarre yeah it's interesting to talk about their marriage their marriage in real life because she had breast cancer and that oh she did yeah and that was real tough for him and there were some times on the show where there were some real emotional things going on with the  how are things in your area in that respect well um starting with my work um we're in a uh aluminum can and paper recycling um i work for TI and there's a uh a lot of paper that gets thrown away here so we've started recycling our uh plain white paper um-hum and we have a a company that collects it and takes care of that that for us uh in the community um Baltimore County that i that's the county i used to live in um they just started experimenting with uh trash pickup where uh one day a week they pick up recycled items and then another day a week they pick up the other trash and uh they've uh contracted with a company here that has a special truck that has different containers on the same truck you know one that holds paper one that holds plastic one that holds tin one that holds aluminum and uh so they've they've started experimenting with doing it um on a very large scale also in Baltimore City they've started doing it uh there's been a lot of awareness um especially here on the east coast because our landfills are you know so filled now that uh there's just not enough room for all the garbage that we uh that we create i think we've all heard about the train load from New Jersey that couldn't find a place to dump or something that's right and the barge from New York that went around the world and um-hum until the garbage all rotted or something we uh our town is just five thousand people and i've been very discouraged by the local authorities dragging their heals about getting into a recycling program each politician who comes up from election promises that that's going to be real high on his list of priorities but it just doesn't seem to be working out that way uh one of our local city council members who happens to be a personal friend of ours made the statement the other day that there would always be landfills and we just sort of came unglued at that point because if that's their thinking then i think we're definitely in trouble here um-hum because there just cannot always be landfills uh my we have always saved aluminum just absolutely forever and uh i'm saving uh paper now and glass our biggest problem is that no one will take the paper it gets really difficult to find someone in fact now i'm donating it to a local church and by giving it to them they take it in mass and then our junk dealer gives them ten dollars just because they've they're a church and he writes it off as a donation but it's a real problem with with the paper to find that outlet for it after you've got it stacked up yeah that's uh it's been a problem that i've noticed a lot in print that uh um once you have collected this what do you do with it because there's not a whole lot of companies that are taking it there's a lot of people that want to participate and given the facilities will participate and they've proven that time and time again um-hum um-hum and uh i was just reading some figures this morning that seventy nine percent of the people polled considered themselves to be environmentalists um-hum and so uh you know it looks like there's a lot of people there who want to do it there's just not a lot of companies out there that know what to do with it another problem that that's uh is plastic milk cartons um um-hum they've got a way to recycle them they've got places that can recycle them into products no problem the problem is that they can't there's no facility to get it from the people that have the raw material the empty milk cartons um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum back to the guy who can do something with it um-hum and uh in order for this company to survive they've had to uh in their area start sponsoring their own recycling centers uh in order to get the raw goods but they you know of course they can they're limited with what they can do they can only do so much and uh sure you know it's it's a matter of i i don't think you know i hate to get government involved with anything because it always costs more money but um you know it's a matter of they're going to have to pass stricter laws or start making i know i know um the garbage collection um more costly um-hum and once they do that then people will be more interested right now it doesn't matter how much garbage you put out to the road it's a flat fee a month right if they started billing people by the pound things might change drastically um-hum as far as well that's one way to force them to recycle is that if they bill them by the pound then they're going to save it and not not put it out to the trash that's right uh it we are in an open rural community and we find more garbage on the roadsides when it starts costing people they simply take a bag and pitch pitch it into a ditch someplace uh my my biggest concern or one of my biggest concerns is is the tires what they're going to ever do with used tires my husband uh recently retired after thirty two years in a service station and of course yeah originally it was no big deal you could get rid of them but now there's just simply no way to get rid of these things and you see more and more of that around about the country where people have have thrown a tire in the ditch or two tires in the ditch and well actually there's a gentleman down in Atlanta who has invented a process using a certain acid and he can take a tire and turn it into immediately burnable oil will the will the EPA allow this it has less sulfur in it than processed fuel oil for the house um-hum it does nothing to hurt the environment and the heat generated by the process is in turn used to run the machine so it's self-sufficient um-hum and very efficient i mean it it control you know it it controls its own process it burns it reduces the amount of fuel that's required in order to get out the fuel at the other end um so far they've demonstrated it on a uh garage size unit that this guy invented they're currently looking for funding to build a larger scale and i saw this about three months ago um-hum uh-hum a lot of these things can be placed in your area because of the density in population and yet they would be just frightfully expensive to put in our area because of the scarcity of population well if you think about it if um uh i remember that when they used to take uh they used to pay you to take the tire you know get the turn in your tire when you got your um-hum um-hum and your your husband probably remembers that better than i do i remember there was a time when they'd give you one or two dollars for your used tire now they charge you two dollars for your used tire um-hum right well he was at the point where if if the customer did not want to take the tire with them he charged them a dollar to dispose of them and still there wasn't really a way to dispose of them this was just to sort of encourage them to take them uh at one time uh not too long ago uh farmers could use uh tires to start a fire burning fence rows which of course was an air pollutant and they've put a stop to any open burning of any kind and they are fining um-hum yeah people now i mean it used to be the law was and no one enforced it but they are enforcing it now and and i'm glad they are however one solution presents another problem well i would like certainly like to see this you know if this is true with this fellow in Atlanta it sounds wonderful yes i saw it on the evening news and um the guy actually took the oil that came out from the process in a measuring cup turned around and poured it right back into the uh tank um-hum that he was using to fire the process in order to run it hum and you actually um with this process by putting in the tires end up with more energy from the oil um-hum than you put into the process so it's a way of of making a profit off the tires um-hum and when you stop and look at the you know something like eight million tires a month that are you know discarded you know there's a lot of tires out there that that could go through this process um-hum well i you've certainly hit on the key to any of it whatever we're going to do there has to be a profit there doesn't there the fellow who recycles the paper and the plastic and the aluminum he's got to be able to make a profit or he just isn't going to do it there's not a profit i think the the problem is that there's there's always a payoff to recycling but it's hard for people to see it um-hum because it's hard for them it's hard to explain to someone that look it's costing us you know umpteen thousand dollars a year to bury this stuff in the ground um-hum and then what is the long-term effect of us burying that in the ground if that stuff it's costing us a lot more than money isn't it yeah it it's going to leak into our water and then we're going to have problems with our water and then it's going to cause health problems and so there is a long-term um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum effect and when you stop and think about it every just about every single thing that's produced can be recycled um-hum um i mean if it's if it's uh food you know if it's stuff you scraped off your plate it can go into the compost and you know and so it's i mean um-hum it there's a way to recycle everything and and um if your husband just retired then i've got to believe that you've got to be old enough to remember that back during the wars hey recycling was the thing to do i mean you didn't um-hum we didn't throw away anything did we that's right if you if you didn't recycle you were un-American and and that was the bottom line um-hum um-hum well we have to come to that now that's all there is to it you do see a lot of positive things uh i saw a printout sheet the other day that i'm going to to copy and take to the girls at sorority  well Brent i've been um i kind of gave up my career about three years ago to stay home with my children because i thought uh if it it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school right and i thought it was a good sacrifice to make uh-huh because um it was important to me to to spend some time with kids i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time my husband was it was really hard on our family because i would he would come home and i would leave and then when i would come home and he would leave and um right so i think one day one of our kids said you know someone came home and they said well when is dad leaving or something it was like that they thought that's the way life was that you didn't have two parents at home at the same time uh-huh and so i think um it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family so there's one or two nights a week we have a on Monday nights we set aside time where it's called uh family home evening and we stay home that evening all of us and we do things together uh-huh um you must be LES yes so am i yes what a coincidence oh you are yes and yeah i know what family home evening's all about so you do that and right and then we try to do a family activity on Saturday usually in the morning um-hum right and then the family home evening too right and then you know sometimes we try to do our lesson on Sunday night and then our activity or something on Monday but right we're it's real important to us to spend time together well that's good um how many children do you have i have two two what what do you have um-hum i have a girl and a boy and the boy's five he's in kindergarten and the girl is four she'll be in kindergarten next year five and four um-hum i have two daughters um-hum my oldest is uh four and my youngest is about to turn three hum uh-huh two girls and they are a handful they are a handful yes we we've my uh well when we first got married my wife worked for a year then we decided to have kids uh-huh and uh she she got pregnant and then we decided she would stay home with the kids we would make that sacrifice it is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one um-hum and uh we made that decision and uh so she after she had the first baby she stayed home and and we had a second baby and she's still at home yes and so uh you know at work a lot of people are you know i think well this is not a normal situation anymore in our in our world we live in most of them uh continue to work if they have have kids um-hum i only have one other person i know in my in my group here that works where the wife stays home and that's because of religious values as well they're Baptists and they and they think that's important um-hum but everybody else works and they drop their kids off at day care and and leave them and i don't know i just don't want i just don't want strangers raising my children well no and it's it's just not um it's not as stable for the kids and they everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now but uh it's yeah right that's how it is at our house when you're on the phone oh it's open anything goes when mom's on the phone well it's also important i think um for my husband i i try to go out of my way to to plan things that he can do with the kids because um-hum since i am home with them and so i get a lot of time with them he needs to have um some time with them so he when he comes home he um you know it's his job at night he puts the kids to bed and he reads right right to them and he he spends about an hour doing that and that's that's pretty good quality time with them and um but it's hard for him on Saturdays he he wants right with all the yard work and things like that right he wants to run out and get things done and so um i try to say well why don't you go fly kites or why don't you do something and um-hum if i have something in mind then he he remembers that that's what he wants to do um-hum right we feel that you know just spending time together you don't necessarily have to be doing anything you know that costs money or or you know that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that it's just the kids like to being together as a family uh-huh like last Saturday we went had some errands to run and so we took the kids and and we went by the Farmers Market down in in down there in Garland um-hum and they had a blast running around the Farmers Market looking at all the you know the food and tasting all the free samples they were giving out and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet you know and they liked that and uh-huh then on the way home we drove by the local high school and there happened to be an FA FAA Future Farmers FA Future Farmers of America FFA yes going on there and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything you know all out in this in the in this schoolyard there so we just said hey let's stop and um-hum and the kids got to go around and you know see pigs and animals and things like that and and for them that's wonderful you know they they they thought it was the greatest fun you know and it didn't cost any money and uh you don't have quite as much money when when the wife doesn't work well that's right but i do think um you know like the current trends are that um the family unit is devaluated it's not nearly as important we find that right you know back just even fifty years ago when people had had financial problems the fir st place they went to was their family and families took care of themselves and um um-hum but now you know people don't they don't support each other that way right right oh definitely motherhood is devalued in this society society if you're stay home and you're a mother it's like what a waste people think you know you should be fulfilling yourself and and a mother isn't an important um-hum that's right and important thing as as having a career and and that should be first and and children second but they don't have kind of an what we call an internal perspective of things that right right right and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make because you know i you know i have interests no right that too and it is hard to make uh those interests not be as a major part of my life uh at this point it's not to say that some day you won't go back to work my mother's a school teacher and um-hum and when when we started uh having kids she had to work for a little while but then she just started substituting uh-huh so she would just substitute once or twice a week you know just for that little extra money when we were in school then we would just come home and just be you know go to a neighbor's house for an hour then she'd be home but she wouldn't do that every day right but now that my my uh youngest sister's at BYU now and so they have no one at home she's back teaching school full time now again so if you know it's not it's just a temporary thing it is temporary it in the middle of it it seems like a long time but you're right it is temporary um-hum well i see that we both share the same belief here that it's important that we spend time with our kids and and in spite of yeah yeah yeah you it's it's hard sometimes at work because you know people say oh we're taking a cruise we're going here we're going there you know because they have a lot more money um-hum and a lot of them decide just not to have children it's it's amazing they either have one or none yes that's true and and the one person i know that has one they they feel guilty she has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing and so on uh on weekends she would you know spend all of their time with their kids and spend lots of lots and lots of money basically i think they they really spoil the child to try to overcompensate for their guilt feelings um-hum and and and they don't want to have anymore children because they just don't think you know that she doesn't think she could be a mother at home that's not her bag so she just doesn't think she could you know the guilt feelings she can't deal with with it anymore so yes well it is the hardest thing i've ever done as much as you'd go out you know um-hum yeah my wife uh and likes staying home uh-huh uh she works at home some though uh-huh the place she works with worked with before um worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home well that's good part time and so uh that it's kind of a seasonal thing three times a year she's really busy doing certain things based on that kind of business but the rest of the time she's free um-hum she likes to sew and do crafts and things like that so she enjoys staying at home but uh the money part of it is not as rewarding obviously but no there's different rewards you know different kinds of rewards yeah i think so i think it's an investment in your future even if it's purely not not religious you can at least say that it's important to our country that our family unit stays strong right right right and you really have to make a quite a bit of money the wife doesn't make it worth it with the cost of day care um-hum yes i know there's you know when you adjust your income for what you put out for day care you know you're only making like five  well what's your thoughts on it okay i i think what happened with savings and loans is uh is what everyone says is they they made a lot of uh of not well secured loans on real estate and when uh the bottom fell out of the real estate market the bottom fell out of their loans um that's it that's that's the primary that and the loosening of the restrictions letting them ease up on their cash reserves and uh like you say all these bad real estate loans and energy loans right yeah um you know i i it's hard to say what caused it i mean you know if if the regulations hadn't been uh hadn't been relaxed maybe it wouldn't have happened but i somehow think it still would have you go in you start making massive investments in those two areas and you're you're just playing the market you know they were just gambling with their their savers' money yeah yeah then of course then of course there was the fraud but you're going to have that anywhere so yeah i think right yeah that seemed to play a pretty big role i think because i don't know i get the feeling that the regulations probably needed to be a little a little more stringent yeah well so are they are they handling it right gee who knows uh i don't don't even know if they know yeah it certainly has has uh the magnitude of the crisis it seems i don't know it it seems much greater than i would have thought it really just seems out of proportion talking they're talking four or five hundred billion dollars yeah yeah i that that's the part of it i couldn't understand i mean yeah i i wonder if there's not a little bit of overzealousness there uh you know they say well this one went under because of bad energy loans bad real estate loans and then they go around classifying everybody as bad when in fact there are some very good yeah loans out there i mean not all real estate loans are bad you know the greatest majority of them are people who own their homes so you know those aren't exactly what you'd call bad i right no i think that a a typically bad loan is is that the ones that just took place massively in Houston when they put up these huge office buildings and spent uh-huh yeah that exactly very large amounts of money and then could simply simply could not rent them out they couldn't even rent them out for expenses it was cheaper to keep them empty yeah yeah yeah the than to rent them at twenty percent occupancy yeah and and that's nothing more than speculation i mean they they yeah yeah it it seems that there should have been something in the regulations saying they couldn't do that i know banks can't do it uh-huh uh back when i used to play the commodities market i i tried to go to the bank to get a loan to buy gold and silver futures and they wouldn't let me well i mean just for me to mortgage my to to get a mortgage on my house i mean they invest investigated me personally to the point where i was insulted and i was putting forty thousand dollars down on a hundred and sixty thousand dollar house yeah yeah i mean i would have thought gosh we're happy to do it just sign here you know but really i mean they had forty thousand dollars in equity and i mean they just wanted to see three years of income tax returns and all that bullshit which really sort of disturbed me and the and and then it yeah yeah and then and then some some rich yo-yo walks in there who's buddies with the bank president saying look i want to borrow right seven hundred thousand dollars so i can invest in this oil well they say oh sure no problem you're a good customer yeah yeah yeah i i uh i run i run a little business on the side out of my home and i tried to uh get set up with my bank to accept MasterCard and Visa um-hum you would think i was asking for an appointment with the president you know and basically what it came down to is they weren't going to let me have it um um they frown on home business they uh they they insist that you have a storefront uh and that's just ludicrous i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors uh architects consultants yeah uh-huh they they work in their home there's no reason for them to have an office they they have very little customer contact and when they do they go to the customer right right so i mean you know what's the story on them you know are you going to let them have it well of course they're going to get it you know all you've got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and they'll give it to you yeah i uh i also run a little business out of my home on the side what's the nature of yours uh mail order primarily uh-huh me and my uh me and my roomie who's also my partner um well we lump everything under this business i mean we do just about everything he's into the computer end of things he does consulting and graphics design and uh-huh oh systems design i mean you name it he does that and then i handle the mail order and whatever else we do we do cat breeding i mean yeah it's all lumped under the business um-hum yeah cat breeding huh uh um yeah make a few bucks here and there on that yeah but um we're we're there's several ways of getting set up to take MasterCard and Visa uh there's several banks out there the smaller banks who are trying to break into the market and they will take the risk on a home business um uh-huh there's i made i made a few contacts through CompuServe um talking about you know hey we're brokers for these banks you know it you don't pay us anything the bank pays us and uh-huh of course what you're dealing with is some somewhat higher costs like a two hundred and fifty dollar nonrefundable application fee right uh wow so if the bank turns you down well that's it you're out two hundred and fifty bucks that's not too great no i i'm i'm i'm leery of it i know that's the way it works um but and as long as you can meet their requirements there there's very little chance they'll turn you down and they do have some requirements like you have to be registered with the State and you have to have yeah a business address and you have to have a business phone line and then you have to have a separate line for their equipment that kind of stuff uh but if meet all those chances are they'll approve you so we're looking at that yeah yeah uh-huh so we're looking at that it's just it's just hard to give somebody two hundred and fifty bucks on a chance you know yeah i would i would find that uh a little bit disarming yeah what what business do you do it's a computer business yeah yeah my uh my roomie is down in Charlotte right now he's got an internship down at IBM uh-huh so business has sort of come to a standstill i see where does does he go to school here yeah he's at uh he's at NC State i see okay what's what's his name i might know him uh Floro Chrisostimo uh-huh okay i guess i don't do you by are you by any chance out at the campus uh no huh-uh oh okay because the last guy i talked to was out on the campus i see ha it was how did how did you get involved in this um i've got a a friend who's in the business who just gave me this application yeah he he picked this thing up from school and brought it home and i said yeah sure i'll do it why not um and he signed up for it and then of course he moved off to Charlotte so now i'm stuck making his calls too i see gosh i don't know what i got roped into ha so uh oh well whatever it's five bucks a shot what the heck yeah yeah what the heck i'm surely not going to count this as business income yeah um really well speaking of that i think we've probably given them their money's worth oh yeah no doubt about it i i usually go until the the recording comes on oh i see i've never gone that long that's have you yeah that it it'll cut you in about ten minutes oh i see uh they used to it used to say you have exceeded the ten minute recording limit but now they just say uh we're sorry our recording capacity is limited today you know a nicer way of saying you talked too long yeah yeah uh-huh but anyway if you need to get going we'll we'll terminate okay well good talking to you maybe we'll maybe we'll chat again all right bye-bye all right later on man bye bye  well what do you think about it well um most of the stuff up until now in the recent months i i i don't have any problem with no i don't either uh i mean it's you know it i don't think it's going to change very much but no i agree with that as as far as the as far as the mess that's developing as a result um you know uh as a country the United States uh i think our hands are tied as far as as as any further involvement until the UN sanctions it in fact it really was to begin with um-hum yeah yeah and uh i just i heard a comment on the radio this morning that uh you know it it gets to a point where uh if enough people are are going to be slaughtered over there over the the the internal problems um somebody may step in again but uh i really think it's it's a UN issue um-hum yeah at that point because it is internal well you know the funny thing i find about American opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before the American public goes crazy uh-huh and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in in Iraq they're going crazy you know i mean you can't please them one way or the other that's right that's right that's absolutely right you know and i and i think that i i agree with you this is exactly the right course i mean that's an internal problem to Iraq it has nothing to do with us um-hum and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the UN gets involved then it's nobody's business that's right um i mean these these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time some of them have been going on for for tens of years if if i understand it right in places like the Sudan and all the time i mean yeah i mean yeah yeah and it's certainly and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years and it's going to continue as long as you have so many diverse groups that are that are vying for power it's going to happen all the time yeah that's right yeah that's absolutely right i mean the Kurds have tried it before they've gotten their butts kicked and this is just another time that it's happening yeah that's that's absolutely right you know and they'll regroup out in the mountains and they'll try it again in a couple of years yeah it was just you know it was it's a very opportune moment for them to try you know you sure and and and i don't have any doubt that through some back channels that we encouraged it oh yeah yeah you know but i i'm not real sure that we promised them anything um-hum i that would have been stupid and i don't and i don't think we did it everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right i don't think they would have done that yeah i agree but it just it it really doesn't make any difference this is just a chapter a another chapter in Middle Eastern history yeah and you know and it there are many of them there's no doubt about it oh sure i mean the the British occupied the place the French occupied it we've done it ah it it's happened so many times this is this is really nothing special uh um-hum well and and and so many of the so many of the conflicts um really don't have a basis in in uh politics or or human rights or anything like that it that's right it's all it's mostly religious anyway it's it's religious based and uh you know by by self-proclamation this is a holy war and it is right and then uh we we go on from there yeah yeah exactly yeah it it's it's a mess it it's there's no doubt about it and uh well i i i think one of the big problems i mean looking at it from the American the American public's standpoints they don't understand the Middle Easterners that's right they don't understand what i mean their politics really isn't politics it's religion couched as politics um-hum um-hum and there's a big difference absolutely you know uh we sit there and and we think that they think the way we think um-hum and that's a big mistake because they don't you bet you bet well yeah because there's no uh you know there there's there's a complete different set of values um there's there's different value placed on human life and uh right down the list you know possessions and and everything else and uh um-hum yeah yeah what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases and it's that's that's that's it a lot of the time i i was stationed in in Turkey for for a year and a half okay and it it was tough understanding understanding those folks yeah yeah you know uh they uh they're uh they're so completely different culturally and socially and um-hum and religiously it's just it was very strange it was very interesting i believe it yeah yeah i can i can i can believe that yeah i i don't claim to have an in-depth understanding by any means but uh now i shoot i i think some of these people that they claim as Middle Eastern experts don't don't have a clue sometimes that's probably true you know they they sit there and and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert well i'm not real sure that's that's appropriate uh-huh no no that's that's uh a a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field no but uh well i sort that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country too yeah and we make experts by reading books you know that's right and the Japanese and the Germans and everybody else make experts by doing uh-huh absolutely yeah absolutely yeah i uh i i guess you work for TI yeah that's right yes so you guys are well aware of the problems with the Japanese markets and everything else right right that's an everyday occurrence yeah it's it's like our car industry the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the Japanese you know came into it and helped us out um-hum um-hum i agree yeah it's it's uh there there is there is it's an overall problem in in in this country understanding uh foreign cultures or even accepting them um um-hum and uh it it it bites us over and over again the the yeah and until we until we start changing our educational system i mean we're we're going to be we're we've already been overtaken but it's going to get even worse later i mean looks who's looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the the math and the science and everything it's not us um-hum that's right that's right you know we we've got folks running around here who get who get degrees in basket weaving and um-hum you know underwater psychology or some some ridiculous stuff like that absolutely and and where are the engineers coming from uh well they're they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there yeah exactly that's my uh my roommate is a uh he's getting his doctorate in industrial well it's not industrial engineering it's human factors his degree was in uh you know industrial engineering okay i see um and he's from the Philippines yeah and the only reason he came here was because the education is much so much better for those who will go after it right he has no intention of going back to the Philippines because there's no jobs sure okay you know uh but i i see it all too often i mean we've got loads of foreign students um-hum and they're coming here going after the hard degrees and then they're going back to Korea and Japan and Hong Kong and everywhere else and they're applying it there absolutely that's right and i don't know it's to me it's amazing i don't know what we're going to do as a country we're we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later yeah because you know every every the the country's got a problem with uh with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that and the long long range views are are just kind of become a thing of the past um-hum yeah you and uh i don't i don't think there can be anymore long range planning i think it it's it's sticking your finger in the holes and the dike um-hum you know uh oh here's a crisis well let's plug it up yeah yeah i don't know i don't know what the answer is it's far beyond me yeah that's for sure that's that's the way things have gotten yeah all we can do is keep plugging yeah you know i i wonder i i read in the paper just last week IBM's unveiling their new laptop computer um-hum well at a price tag of six thousand bucks i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers no absolutely because uh now i have the i i have the IBM PS two okay but i'm sorry i got it yeah it's slow it's uh there are many better machines on the market right now for yeah a the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan through the school and i saved forty eight percent so i said yeah if i can have an IBM for forty eight percent discount i'll take it okay okay um-hum absolutely but up to that point i had never i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name that's right but that's absolutely right yeah now you watch just sure as anything the Japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price with more stuff on it uh-huh uh-huh yeah the the unfortunately the way the the way the high tech market goes by the time you can get get something in your hands um it it's it's obsolete and uh um-hum it's already outdated yeah we're we we fight that that battle every day here at work uh yeah yeah i i can imagine i uh years ago i remember when i had a TI ninety nine um-hum put all the money into the expansion box and all this that and the other and uh things just kept changing so much and i kept getting rid of them and i finally said well you can't do this you've got to buy something and stick with it so i that's right that's right so i just at an opportune time i got one that that suited my needs and i've just stuck with it the only thing i've done to it is just add a uh add a mouse and a hard drive okay yeah and that's all i plan to do of course i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line i got the model twenty five oh okay so i'm stuck with six forty but i'm not a power user so it doesn't matter yeah well that that's that's the key you know whatever whatever works for you and uh yeah if it does the job then that's that's what you need yeah now my roomie on the other hand he is a power user he's he's looking now to get rid of his he's got a three eighty six and wants to get a four eighty six you know this kind of stuff uh-huh  uh are you big into lawn and garden work well um i just bought a home so i've just now went out and purchased my brand new lawn mower and um so i've been assembling it and haven't had a chance to get out there and and test it out well do you is it a new house or no it's um uh it's an older home and uh so it already has the the yard's already been established um but there have like big oak trees in the front and so the grass is not growing out underneath the oak trees so i'm have to get out there and do something about that you know spread some seed and fertilizer and stuff um-hum okay i think one of the some of the problems with uh oak trees is their leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of acid into the soil oh uh-huh so i found that when i had a uh wooded lot that i needed to put a lot of lime out oh okay okay to uh neutralize the uh the acid from the uh oak leaves um-hum uh-huh but there's still a problem that uh the shade from the trees just uh grass cannot grow right right right and uh one of the things that uh we did uh just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees and planted uh pachysandra um-hum oh uh-huh which is a a shade plant that seems to do well underneath the trees hm that's an idea yeah so that saved the bare spots and uh you know also eliminated mowing the uh that area of the lawn um-hum yeah that's true that's true yeah i have um in between the street and the sidewalk see are two of the oak trees um-hum and then there's one uh sitting on the right uh facing the house on the right hand side in the middle of that whole section and then i have this whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but just just the grass so that may be an idea to do is uh because i've got that concentration of trees right there is to uh you know just do something like what you said was to put some kind of um uh little plants that does well in shade uh the shaded area and forget about you know trying to plant grass and stuff underneath that um-hum the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i don't know if i'm uh going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if i'm going to have to pick them all up by hand or what i don't think there's it's it's an impossible task well i know but if you saw how many acorns were sitting up under there you'd see it looks like an impossible task but we have um um Texas has a lot of the um uh wooden fenced in back yards um-hum for privacy fence so i did buy a a weed eater too and uh so i could get you know around uh around the wooden fences and um uh you know get all the weeds and stuff up out of there yeah well one of the things you may need come fall is a leaf blower or a leaf vacuum um-hum um-hum um-hum because i've you know my wooded lot at my previous house uh i didn't have to mow the lawn very often because it didn't grow that fast right but in the fall i had to spend a couple of weekends out there on you know two separate weekends just getting rid of leaves um-hum wow so what what did you did did you use do you have a blower or did you have the uh the vacuum well i had a a leaf vacuum to pick them up and uh um-hum in the front yard i would uh just drive up to the curb and drop them at the curb the uh county had a pickup service for leaves dropped at the curb huh uh-huh um-hum and for the back i would uh vacuum them up and then put them on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to to dump them uh-huh wow and springtime you have to use bags to pack them uh-huh uh-huh yeah that i've never i don't think i've ever seen um a a vacuum though for the for the lawn i know i've seen the blowers yeah well uh Craftsman put out a uh leaf vacuum a few years back craftsman Sears and Roebuck who was it oh Craftsman uh-huh and uh i think it was about two hundred dollars or something like that it was a very powerful machine huh and it would have a tendency to pick up some of the uh acorns if they didn't get uh pressed into the ground uh-huh ooh that'd be good i think that's that's my problem is i i couldn't believe uh uh because uh i guess the other people they weren't really outdoor type people because the lawn really needs to be i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh so i'm just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing um-hum because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up um so you know i'm going to have to get out there and yeah but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because i've i've lived in an apartment for so long i've never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff right yeah it's especially delightful moving from an apartment to a house so that you you can have a little piece of turf you can call your own yeah right right so this has been uh this has been an experience for me and uh uh but i i can't wait until we have uh uh some more time to get out there in the front yard and and really do uh you know a lot of landscaping um-hum because i want to cut down all the the trees that they or the little shrubs that they have because some of them are like um they have the new uh green leaves i don't if it's getting green up there where you are uh but they're almost fully blossomed and but there are like sides of them where there're like whole dead uh portions of the shrubs um-hum and uh so i've been debating of whether or not just to cut out the dead portions or you know just to take it all out and i think i've pretty well decided just to take it all out and start all over again well you better price the new shrubs before you do that i'm just going to get the little baby shrubs the little baby ones you know take several years to grow there um um-hum well it's not too bad i mean i i i thought they were pretty reasonable but i don't know i have nothing really to compare it with uh you know four or five dollars for a for a shrub yeah i don't know and uh i hadn't really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers well my wife got carried away this past year and uh she cleared out a lot of the existing gardens and replanted with new things um-hum um-hum and i think she spent over a thousand dollars on plants and uh and fertilizers and mulch and everything else and it's it's not hard to go through the money doing that wow um-hum um-hum wow it's true it's true just just picking up the equipment that i have you know and and and i didn't blink an eyelash that's what got to me when the man you know said and that'll be five hundred and something dollars you know with my my big new lawn mower and stuff i was just okay you know so yeah you're right you're right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or um we have like Home Depot here i don't know if you have that there is um-hum we don't have that here we've we've got some uh local nurseries that are pretty fair on price but still in the metropolitan area they they hold a gun to your head while they while you write out your check yeah local uh-huh there you go that's right that's true i understand that well it was nice talking to you all right good luck with your new home well thank you and uh nice talking to you oh okay talk to you bye bye  and she's expecting the end of this month and she's the only one that lives nearby oh oh well that'll be nice though so the rest live in one lives in Connecticut and a couple lives in Pittsburgh and one lives near DC so uh but still sort of up in that general area of the country so you can probably see them sometimes yeah yeah yeah we see them once in a while a couple of times a year at least and the ones in Pittsburgh of course we see more often yeah yeah so uh okay all right i'm ready to go well uh what kind of recycling do you have in your area well they've been trying different things one one of the biggest problems seems to be we don't they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled um-hum right now we've recycled glass for years because years because we have a glass industry in our community oh what which one is that Owens oh uh-huh um so glass has been recycled for a long time uh we have a cycling area set up here at our house the Boy Scouts have and they've done that for years uh the stores are recycling their plastic bags now you can take them back in and they have bins to collect those uh um-hum the aluminum cans they try to do the uh newspapers and uh they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it they were what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals uh-huh that type of thing and that didn't work but but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw which is why they couldn't sell it you know because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a you know similar price oh yeah sure okay i think by this fall it's going to be required that the town of Clarion which we live nearby will have mandatory recycling started so on just particular things or uh mainly the glass the aluminum the plastics uh-huh uh well it sounds like they're doing quite a bit well we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator um which we do not want built and uh we would like industry to do more before they build these big huge incinerators yeah and uh we we just feel they should they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing them um-hum because some of those companies that are doing it have save money eventually at first apparently it costs more to get started right but once they get established then it's a money saving thing well our company does some things all of which i couldn't even tell you about i don't know all of them but and what is TI uh Texas Instruments oh okay gee my my son works for no not for that okay excuse me go ahead well i i was just curious as how you got hooked up with this this speech type of thing if well my son works in uh for the federal government he's he works in a computer laboratory oh and he and uh it was through him that yeah well here at work um each one of us has two trash baskets in our office and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that um they want to use you know for recycling they can't deal with every type uh maybe you could tell me what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers well i guess i don't know specifically except that uh for the paper that they want to recycle they do not want any newspaper um and things like candy wrappers or uh that type of thing let's see i have a list here um they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes uh phone books so there are you know a lot of kinds of things that they don't want but then any kind of computer paper letters uh booklets they'll even take things that are bound um um and it doesn't all have to be like white they'll take colored folders and and uh even some of those can have plastic tabs on them so it's it's hard to kind of figure out oh really hum you know which things are the right ones i mean i i'll frequently have to look at the list if it's something that i don't throw away all the time um it's neighbor yeah but um they do that and then we use uh different chemicals and things and i know that you know they're real concerned about how they take care of that sort of thing i i don't know all the details but they're really on top of that right yeah right yeah yeah and there probably some other things that i don't about because we're a real large company and i just don't have contact with them but in our uh city well i live in a suburb of Dallas um-hum um um-hum um-hum and they have initiated a newspaper recycling whereby they pick it up from your alley uh one day a week and all you have to do is bundle it um-hum um-hum uh-huh uh all around Dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things sometimes for money um but most of those are real far away from um-hum like where i live at any rate well it would be inconvenient to in other words to very inconvenient and um it's just you know hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things if they would make it something where they you know would pick it up at the curb or at least make it you know down the street and up the corner type of thing uh right more areas where they would pick it up yeah yeah that wouldn't be so bad um our grocery store like yours will take the uh plastic bags and they'll also take the the paper bags back yeah um um-hum but um uh you mentioned the uh glass type of stuff the reason i ask you about that is years ago and it it changed names somewhere along the line but um my dad used to work for Knox Glass in Knox Pennsylvania oh well Knox is just over the hill here yes uh-huh they they no longer are you know oh really yeah it's active yeah they were taken over by Glass Containers years ago and but he worked for them for like thirty one years yeah oh for heaven's sake and used to travel up there to Knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know so yeah oh for heaven's sake well we only live probably about fifteen twenty miles from Knox oh really yeah uh-huh yeah we i was looking through a photo album not long ago and they had had some pictures and things in there of Knox i'll be darn yeah but uh i guess that's about it you know as far as what goes on that i know about uh-huh uh-huh i think people are getting more interested and they are more concerned and we're just we're just real concerned about this incinerator because we really they want to put it right in uh in between two of our main water sheds that feed the Clarion River River um and uh we we just we just don't want it anyplace we feel that we that they should give businesses more incentives to do more recycling and more reduction and and more reuse and all those things that could be done yeah we we just don't think we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests yeah that's and uh it's it's been a real struggle and a hardship for a lot of people in our area that we have you know have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed to make them more more right uh-huh but uh well i think probably more people you know would participate if they just made it a little easier and like you say make it um um-hum better for companies to do these things get involved in it without huge cost to them because obviously no one wants to spend a lot of money just to deal with trash you know um-hum um-hum right right uh well we're we're going to pay for that that whether we pay industry or pay we we've already paid industry for like these super fund that's cleaning up we paid industry for it yeah that's true we pay all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place it's leaked and now they have to clean those up and it's our money that's cleaning this stuff up and now they want to put it in they burn it and that will make another hazardous dump that's right um-hum and eventually they'll have to do something with that we'll pay for it again so why not pay industry this is my feeling why not pay industry a little more and reduce it you know and and not have as much of it that's true um-hum also probably look at packaging and that sort of thing we don't we don't need three quarters of what we get oh definitely hum-um hum-um no but they think and probably the right people buy it i uh that's their marketing yeah yeah well and i know people would be willing to do more like saving their newspapers and that if they had a place to take them we don't have anyplace right now that will take them yeah i i'm guess our city you know in picking them up must take them somewhere else and get something for them um-hum probably yeah but i don't know that it's a big money  what do you think about the uh Peace Corps or public service commitment uh that's the first i've ever heard of it i haven't heard of it anything too much about it um well i think it was uh thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft and people said well they uh young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from um some sort of public service like the Conservation Corps back in the thirties or uh-huh uh various other things of that sort and it seems to me that it's it's not a totally bad idea but i don't quite see how they'd make it work uh-huh how would they decide who goes into uh building fire breaks in Yosemite National Park and who goes to Saudi Arabia right yeah i the my first impression was um it would be very very good i think it would be good for people to serve but i don't know if it should be an option it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the Depression or coming out of the Depression available for kids and i think there are some available now where they are able to work but making it a mandatory thing yeah the the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary that it should be like a draft kind of right uh-huh and some people would get military service and some people would get civilian uh service like working in hospitals this i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do uh-huh uh-huh when people were drafted and they refused to serve in the Army they were allowed to do hospital service or uh things like that and if they refuse or farm work in World War One i remember uh-huh uh reading about and and i suppose that there is uh justification for taking everybody if you take anybody uh-huh but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them uh sorting them out assigning them training them would be insurmountable uh-huh it seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious conscientious objectors if they had that choice yeah well it's a possibility yeah you know i'd i'd much rather work in a hospital than than to go to war and i'm sure most young men and women would and so uh well i think that in the in the cases that like that uh they had to be uh pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth and that this wasn't something new just to keep out of going to war it was uh-huh uh something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life uh-huh well that makes sense and then you run into again to um the bureaucracy in running it you know how you going to cover that many people because we've got a lot more people now than we did then oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something so right for their room and board and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend uh even if it's like the Peace Corps where they don't get most of it until they come home you have to have to pay them something uh-huh uh-huh plus the training involved yeah that would be expensive in most cases oh yeah yeah now i had a lot of friends who went to the Peace Corps uh back in the mid sixties because uh-huh and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization but on the other hand i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was i don't know what we got for all the money uh-huh we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to uh what was then East Pakistan is now Bangladesh and to uh Algeria and to uh-huh uh Southeast Asia and lots of uh out of the way places but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went in teaching the people how to cope with their lives better uh-huh well i know in i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught Christianity in Japan uh-huh and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me it taught me not to be so self-centered and it you know to think of others uh-huh but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation you know not a really religious background if if i would get a lot out of it you know i think i did because it you know it emphasized that sort of thing you know a lot of sure self and it was definitely voluntary too they were not drafting you and sending you against your will evaluation but right right and that i'm sure that would make a big difference too yeah well what about a voluntary program do you think that would be a good idea you know we've got um well like i say i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth like teenagers to go and do um work in the national parks and work in uh neighborhoods to do um clean up and that sort of thing but i don't know what organization it's under i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private i don't either charity that's put it together but i know that that helps a lot with training and um yeah out here in California there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps a lot of uh-huh and they do forestry work they maintain trails and they uh put up signs and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort uh-huh and that i know is run by the State but there may be other things i'm not so sure what kind of uh training that is for the future for those kids yeah how much benefit it'll do them in the long run it's probably a a very good way to keep them off the streets and out of trouble but whether it's something that they can put to to economic use later on is a different subject right especially in you know if you take a a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the a middle of a park if they go back to the inner city they may not see trees for a while much less be able to take care of them that's true good point so that's yeah so that may not may not benefit them in the long run oh yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm going to have to go but my other line is blinking but it was good to talk to you but okay well thank you you too bye-bye bye  well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes it's very easy for anybody to find out about you your well i don't really like that very much yeah uh the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about finding out this particular person from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are uh his uh social security number driver's license any kind of records he may have uh their credit card and the status of their credit what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff it was just as a demonstration to show oh those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person and it was mostly it dealt with uh marketing companies these uh direct marketing oh yeah um-hum associations that was the primary subject that's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets uh their habits their hobbies their income um and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer that's not really good i don't know i guess that's an invasion of privacy i'm not sure that that's an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual um-hum something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something that's really so common that it's accepted as the norm now is the open the open office concept the open office uh-huh where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a a large room and and people have little cubicles well that's all fine and good but you don't really have any privacy at all yeah not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i suppose suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard right and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen yeah yeah there's there is and and it's not it's not just that it's uh the whole thing about you know if if you're trying to concentrate well it's rather hard sometimes it's almost impossible to do um-hum because um you know you're uh you're time and you're space is is not your own space um-hum and i've work in a situation like that and i well kind of have a problem with that do you work with uh mixed company male and female or oh yeah is there anybody who doesn't well there there are a few out there it's i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at yeah but um my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles there's nothing to block anything hm so yeah but um i guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record or yes the computer is the the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears um-hum in front of them and you don't have to i i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families um-hum that's no secret and it shouldn't be that way i don't think yeah i don't i don't think that's that's quite right either i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people i'll tell you that yeah hm so what do you think could be done about it uh the only way it can change is um if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say we've had enough of you out you go but uh i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done um i don't know it's it's still a a free i suppose country insofar as we're we're able to obtain information and i wouldn't be for total banning of uh all information or it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about but it's it's hard to define yeah uh a lot of those boundaries it really is it's something that something that i've just had a a dealing with is like a credit bureau uh-huh well they take they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common uh-huh and they they check that name against uh their list and they find several and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name so you've received a lot of uh flack they don't they don't even check my social security number um and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and they're not they're so lazy they're just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up um-hum you know and that just drives me crazy because they're and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and i'm like baloney um-hum you messed it up you fix it is that usually what you tell them in the letter no what i've taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report um-hum like uh uh recently i was reported as having JC Penney accounts and i don't so i called JC Penney and i said uh i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency you're using is incorrectly reporting the information that you're providing to them and they say uh-huh because they really don't want to pay for services that's not being done properly either so then they can call um-hum the credit bureau and say hey you know we're paying you good money to report this properly and you're not doing your job good idea so that's what i've taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far um-hum oh that's good any other problems not that i can think of yeah i i guess i've just about run out of yes i i can probably go on but it's it's uh i'm clouding up right now oh yeah probably better let you get back to work well it's nice talking to you okay maybe again alrighty bye-bye bye-bye  okay when is the last time i saw a movie yeah well i don't know it hasn't really been that long but my my uh the last movie i saw was on TV uh and i was trying to remember it was called Back Stab and it was uh it was really intriguing and i found i i i have a i have a problem with i just about forget them once i've seen them but i guess the really the one that i really saw that i really liked was Ghost did you see that the Ghost yes yeah i saw it on campus that's very good yep uh Ghost with um um um right Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg Demi Moore and and uh and the guy who did did the right i don't remember his name um the dancing the dirty uh i'll think of it in a minute yeah he was it was really good i just thought that was great yeah right yeah i thought that it made you think about um you know what happens when you die and everything and is are there really angels and ghost and things and so um-hum um-hum um it almost makes you kind of think about things it gives you a different way of thinking them because you you're you're in you you know that you always wonder and when you see something like that that kind of well hey well maybe it could be that way yeah right maybe it's really maybe i should take life more seriously and and be a little bit more careful but uh yep um huh i know so let's see what else have i seen i saw how about how about i guess we could talk about TV movies i mean i don't know that they're really really truly movies i mean uh uh have you seen one lately well i was thinking about actually i was thinking about it's not really a movie but it's an hour hour um Thirty Something the other night do you ever watch that oh i used to that's a very good show they had it uh is that still on yeah and they had a new episode uh this past uh what is it Tuesday Monday Tuesday night maybe hm and uh do you know any of the characters um Ellen yeah she got married yeah she got married she got married i don't know did you ever know Gary Gary yes right the longhaired guy that one right well he got killed awhile awhile awhile back yeah and his uh an image of him was at the wedding he did oh and he was uh talking to his friend Michael telling an image of him oh like a ghost well well it looked like looked like him but it would have to been his spirit or something and uh oh that's weird oh i'm telling you i just cried and cried and cried and cried it was so sweet it was sweet but it was sad because you know you just really miss Gary yeah yeah so well yeah i know some of those some of those shows are very moving um um-hum i know i really liked some of them there was there's one about someone got divorced um i don't one of the partners uh oh right Elliot and uh Nancy right right but they're back together oh they're back together okay oh yeah oh boy you've really missed a i've no i've i've been out for years uh i didn't think it was on anymore um but yeah right you watch the reruns boy i mean you could watch those for a long time if you haven't if you don't even know what's going on at all yeah yeah yeah well yeah i don't have much time to watch TV i'm a grad student trying to trying to get a a PhD thesis out so oh you are uh well that doesn't leave too much time for a movie uh right right but we go out occasionally and uh there's some there's some good um sort of artsy movies i saw a computer animation festival it was all about computer generated or else um actually it's just sort of animation in general some were computer generated and some were hand drawn um cartoon like things hm and there's some really neat stuff they can do now with computers and and some of the cartoons are just hilarious um was this uh done not by TI people was it but uh no it's just there's an annual festival i guess where they they collect the best entries and they make it into a full length movie and each each cartoon is is completely independent and separate from everything else and laugh you know a few minutes um um-hum but some tell stories you know some are serious some are funny um but uh there all there all fun to watch they're they're full you know they're for adults they're not just kids cartoons they're they're genuine stories and things um-hum um-hum um-hum hm so anyway um-hum that sounds interesting well go watch some movies and if we get this topic again maybe okay so how did this topic get picked did you did it just get picked at random or um i don't know it's at random right no when when i place the call they just you don't have a choice well you you you had marked on your on your sheet what you had interest in or no interest in or so oh okay oh okay oh okay oh okay yep okay well all right well nice talking to you all right bye-bye you too bye-bye  um what is your experience been with like do you have elderly relatives that live with you or have lived with your parents or something like that no um my husband has a grandmother in a nursing home and that has been a real mess to say the least uh-huh but uh they keep seem to keep moving her in and out of different ones that they had just got done moving her uh into another one because the one she was in they gave her some medication she was definitely allergic to and almost killed her oh gosh and and and it was posted you know above her bed not to give her penicillin and they gave gave it to her anyway but but they gave it to her anyway and just she just about died we had my grandfather had Alzheimer's Alzheimer's disease and my grandmother kept him at home as long as she could hm yeah actually my parents and my uncle and aunt who tried to convince them to go into like an old age community where he could have gotten care yeah and she could've had help with somebody cleaning and things like that and she refused she she just didn't want to do it she felt i i don't know maybe too much guilt or something yeah yeah yeah i i i don't i don't feel he uh my husband's grandmother is that bad off and they they offered you know to get to hire you know an a roommate or uh or a part time nurse and she just wouldn't have it at all uh-huh and so eventually they were forced to put her they they were forced to put her in a nursing home yes well my grandfather he eventually completely lost yeah um-hum control type of things i i mean i don't know if he ever really got violent but they put him in a nursing home and actually the problem that they had with him was more with the hospital the the nursing home you know some day he had a fever or something so they sent him to a hospital which is what they think to routinely do which i think is ridiculous too yeah yeah you know because they might not be really be sick and at the hospital they um did an electrocardiogram uh-huh and decided that he had a heart problem and you know here he was oh my very old he had Alzheimer's he'd been like a vegetable for a year and the hospital said oh we have to put in a pacemaker and you know wanted to prove approval for it and all this sort of stuff and eventually yeah oh oh boy you know the whole family is in an uproar discussing it and some of the kids said well they yeah they should do it and others you know said it's ridiculous this man whose body finally wants to die just let him die and um oh yes eventually the at the hospital they said no to the doctor and they found out it wasn't even his electrocardiogram that there was some other patient you know by the time he'd been sent back to the nursing home and yeah oh my gosh under care there it tears apart families it really it it it just the biggest fights but oh just it it it's because of that i mean that that will divide you divide brothers and sisters quicker than anything its it's horrible sometimes you just can't keep the person at home they're just know oh that's true but but the the nursing home situation is such a is such a pitiful situation i mean if you just if you go every time we go visit her it's just it's just gut wrenching to me oh i felt went to visit my grandfather one time in the nursing home and i said never again i said i just can't go i i can't i i i can't hardly handle it myself uh-huh and uh it's it's but i had a cousin of mine that was in a different nursing home which was sort of nicer you know and until really close to the end she was able to go out and take walks and things and they took her outside and in some ways i think it might have even um-hum been better or i i say say cousin's like my grandmother's cousin but i had been really close to her and in some ways i think for her might have even been better because she used to live in uh-huh yeah an area that when she moved down there was mostly elderly people well not oh really you know it was like a community of apartments that were mostly elderly when she moved there she might have been like sixty it wasn't you know ancient but you know older and then that community for some reason started getting the apartments were fairly low income i guess yeah yeah and started being bought out by families and things and she started having fewer and fewer friends uh-huh and people just she she she she used to say to me when at when she was ninety two or something at the time say oh my um you know i just i all my friends have died off i have nothing to do i'm bored you know i walk over to the store i walk back someone comes and picks me up and brings me to the community and so when she went to a nursing home yeah in the beginning i think she kind of liked it she did art work there she did it was almost a progressive type nursing home yeah well if you're not in real bad shape it's it's you know a retirement a retirement home is is is a good idea for somebody like that but uh if you've got a lot of health problems uh-huh yeah then you just can't get better it it it's just it's a mess it's just a big huge mess because because my husband's grandmother has a lot of health problems uh-huh and uh and his like his other parents grandparents on his other side both were in a nursing home and his grandmother his other grandmother his dad's mother finally went into a coma and she was in a coma for almost two years in a nursing before before she passed away and that that was awful uh-huh well i'm sure and and um does the medical care in nursing homes is typically less than pitiful it it it's it's in but are they supposed to give as much well well well what what they do is is they're supposed to monitor them but they don't monitor them very well at all home care you know i mean that that's the problem uh his grandmother that's in it now she had a stroke and they didn't catch it for three days if you can imagine such a thing jeez so that so then that she that was when she got moved from the first one to the second one where she was given penicillin uh-huh of the second one at the second one an d now she's at the third one so it's it it it it's been a really bad situation but i have but that's all i hear about nursing homes is bad situations oh gosh that's horrible had they checked into these nursing homes much before they put her in it or they just sort of i mean i it's something that's hard to even get places in there you're lucky if you get a spot well that yes that that's true but um they're in a smaller small area and our and in fact they're over up in Missouri and and and and what i would you would really consider a rural area and where there's like one nursing home per town uh-huh no so you probably don't have too much choice yes oh no no no there's there is not a whole lot of choice so they've they've moved through three different towns now uh-huh so um but really it's pitiful it is and it the regulations i don't think the government the government regulations are the place i i don't think are are adequate either because they just don't the ones i've been in just don't aren't real real clean uh you know they do they do a halfway decent job but i it seems like they're they're they tend to be kind of slack often times i've gone into nursing homes where you know they have like a central area where they take the people to and all you do is to just sort of sit there like leave them yes you know almost like they're mentally retarded patients or something and some of them you know they're just sitting in the wheelchair and sleeping or whatever and it's just it's heart breaking you know and and i i feel like you know what have i moved into and and they're vegetables uh-hum i know i know it's some of them i think just needs stimulation yeah i mean it's almost like a mental hospital atmosphere instead of a nursing home yeah well i've never been to a mental hospital but we well me neither but but it just seems like that's what it would be like right like you expect expect from the movies of mental hospitals like uh one time Rick went and uh i went i didn't go with him and his grandmother was sitting there and she said that man across the hall is naked and he was he was sitting in his wheelchair stark naked oh gosh he had he'd got himself undressed and and he just he just like to sit in his wheelchair naked that's not funny but it was funny at the time yeah yeah but the the i mean the poor man too he could get really cold he could yeah yeah It was in the it was in the summer at at at at the time but you think they would pay more attention to what was going on that they'd see this guy had taken off his clothes that's crazy but i think they're under stress i mean i can't imagine working in a nursing home like that either because it must be so depressing oh oh no oh i couldn't do it i just absolutely couldn't do it but you know when i see them i don't know that i could when i think of my parents who fortunately shouldn't be close to getting there yet but i don't think of i know having to make the decision as to put them into a place like that or not me too that that is what scares me to death having to be in a in the position like that but you think you think there could be something better than that horrible i guess i would try and have somebody at the house as long as they were healthy enough but sometimes they're yeah yeah not i i don't know where have the old days gone where people just sort of died of something in their family houses and they're you know yeah yeah people are stabbed but it's not this torture yeah yeah i've been i've been real fortunate my family's never had anybody anybody anybody like in in in a nursing home but Rick's family my husband's family really has has has uh-huh that's it's it's interesting because it's my mother's parents well actually my father's parents both of them sort of you know they just died of something um but the my grandmother my grandmother's case which is very sad she fell she came into New York to visit and she fell at the airport going down some steps and spent you know six months in the hospital but it is was still it it was it wasn't yeah so yeah oh how awful oh you know the same as a nursing home type of thing right but still that's six months in a hospital yeah no that was that that that was horrible it was and she she never even got to see her family that she came in to visit oh how aweful they they never come to see they never came to see her no they came to the hospital but i mean she came in yeah but then she didn't get to go there oh i see you you know she came in for a pleasurable visit and oh how awful fell and cracked cracked her skull open and that was sort of it but just terrible oh oh how awful but um my it was really just my grandfather i guess and this one elderly cousin of mine that went into nursing homes yeah but it's just a scary thought every time i certainly don't want to be like that someday science medical science has prolonged life but they have they haven't really prolonged the quality of it that that's i think that's really the problem they can bring you back bring bring you out of death but they can't yes  all right do you do garden work as little as possible i'm a college student uh-huh so if i do any garden work it's only when i go home in the Summer oh where do you go to college where's that it's about two hours north of Pittsburgh oh okay yeah yes well do you do you know do you do gardening at home yeah we go home well we have a large family there's twelve kids in my family oh my goodness so like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden hm so we have a pretty good size garden yeah well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too yeah i had a whole bunch of flowers and things well i don't have as many now we lived in the country for a long time and i had a whole bunch but so um-hum now i work and i live in the city so that sort a kind of hung it up i have a few flowers but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that um-hum and this year i decided that well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it but i decided that i don't like grass i don't like to have to have to pull grass um-hum uh-huh so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot uh-huh to go see how it worked and mine looks real good you you know i've seen a lot of people that do that yeah i've seen you know like elderly people that really can't get out too much and sometimes like we i have a great aunt that lives in a um-hum it's it's just like uh a high rise for elderly people and you know she does her own thing and everything but she has it's like a little apartment building and she has a tomato plant year round uh-huh oh because she you know they keep it warm with for all the older people and she keeps it year round i had never thought about that i could probably plant one and bring it in and just like i bring my plants in every year uh-huh that'd be neat well i got a patio and i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots and planting them all in it you know because that's favorite thing is tomatoes to grow um-hum and so um but he said no he was going to plant in the earth you know like he always has because he's always had a garden out in the country um-hum and i think he kind of misses it a little bit you know since we moved to the city but um i went ahead and planted one and mine looks better than his it does and then i like um you know what daylilies are pardon me daylilies are are they well do they just come out in the morning then go so but we call them morning glories up here uh-huh that bite you no no hum-um these look like a lily they look like a a well they really look like an orchid oh really when they come out uh-huh that what the look like but they only bloom for one day oh they'll um you'll have a bud the evening before and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it it opens it starts opening up and then when it gets dark it closes and that's it it only blooms for one day and then it's done completely done uh-huh oh yeah but um they look like orchids is what they look like but they look like different color ones like i have uh yellow ones and i have red ones and i have purple ones and then they have like you know the velvety real velvety looking stuff inside um-hum oh yeah it looks just like orchids in different colors that's what they look like oh that'd really pretty they are they're beautiful uh i have a friend when i lived out in the country and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year you know or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with um-hum and i mean they were real expensive they were like well the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirty two fifty for one bulb oh my gosh so what she would do is she would plant them and they multiplied so the next year when she you know weeded them out so they wouldn't be as thick then she'd give me some of the bulbs uh-huh and i mean i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen so when we decided to move it was really funny because like i said i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things and i kept saying well i want to take a few of these and i want to take these and i want to take these my husband finally said look are we going to take the grass can we leave the grass i said yes we may leave that and we had a tree take the whole grass the whole yard yeah and we had a tree that was um like seventeen foot tall or something like that and he said no no i am not taking the tree you know i mean every time we went outside he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that but the last day he said can't we leave the grass and i said yeah i think we will leave that but um i brought um my kids when they were little they had given me uh some azaleas so i brought all my azalea bushes and you know i brought i brought as much as i could bring that'd be funny um-hum yeah uh-huh without you know really tearing up their place but just like um you know the people that bought ours um-hum they bought the place but um i knew that they would you know if i left like one bulb of each one of them by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them yeah so it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something you know it would cover it right up uh-huh but i just couldn't see it you know going off and leaving everything like that yeah because this house i really liked it and everything but the yard was a lot to be desired oh there was nothing these people we have one ugly pine tree um-hum i mean and it is ugly i even tried making it look nicer you know i tied the yellow ribbon around it and it was so ugly oh it did not help let me tell you i took it off and put it on my door i did not want to call attention yeah i mean it was terrible so really the plants that i brought over and put out here the are just about all i don't do any of the mowing or you know edging and all that my husband does all that stuff uh-huh but that's because i'm allergic to the grass oh that'd be awful i love going out in the Summer in the grass really now i like to go to the beach where the sand is because then it doesn't make me ill uh-huh yeah but um well even up here at school you know you it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass yeah i used to until it i got so allergic to it i don't know if it's all well i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to but it's not as bad here um like Saint Augustine i think is what we have and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country um-hum but out in the country i mean if i went outside while he was mowing the grass i was going to have a gigantic attack oh my gosh so um i get shots for it now too that helps a whole bunch but one good thing about it see i don't have to mow the grass or i mean that's really nice uh-huh yeah but well you said that you had a garden what what all things do you plant in it or do you like to plant in it um well the first thing we always plant is tomatoes i mean every year i don't care if we don't have anything else we're going to have tomatoes and then we plant cucumbers and uh we uh-huh uh-huh do your cucumbers come good oh yeah uh really sometimes when my dad has like that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad he takes care of all the cucumbers because he said the vines are just so at our house as soon as you touch a vine it's like it completely dies really it must be the um at uh-huh sometimes we have really good luck with them but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything now that's i mean that's something that grows like a weed here oh wow i mean it grows like a weed we have to allow extra room for those because you know i mean extra space between the rows and all yeah because they take up a lot yes but i mean we usually get if we plant for every one plant we probably get fifty to sixty cucumbers off of it holy smoke i mean just pulling them as fast as you can we usually give them to everybody anybody that wants a cucumber can have it but we tried it too where you run it up a fence uh-huh uh-huh and um yeah we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other oh my gosh i mean it was but we they're so heavy you know they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down but uh-huh i mean cucumbers here grow like crazy wow of course it's real hot here too you know well see tomatoes grow like crazy at our house Like we have a section of tomatoes and we put the tomatoes there every year in the same section And i swear we get tomatoes six rows up um-hum yeah yeah now if we have any like the birds will pick or something you know and some of the seeds drop have you ever had them just come up in different places from that uh-huh i know we do that too you know and at the first year because i was from the city when we got married and the first year that we planted i couldn't figure out i mean the well the first year after uh-huh i mean we planted them but the first year you know after we'd had a crop yeah all these little things like we had cucumbers coming up you know in the middle of our okra and i thought how did this get here i know i didn't put that seed there and it was weird but the birds had you know evidently just uh-huh yeah deposited them for us uh-huh well sometimes too when we take out our garbage and we usually you know we just dump it in the middle of the garden you know after your garden's basically done um-hum and we're now finding out like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now because we took peach seeds and dump them there whenever the garden like in the fall um-hum now we have peach trees coming up  crime in the cities and i guess in some of the rural areas too seems to be going up i don't know it'll ever go down on any steady basis uh more people more opportunities and somewhat of a lessened uh sensitivity toward it it's almost um you know it's almost expected that that's going to occur and there's not quite the shock any more especially the so-called littler things where people tend to steal a little time at work or steal a few supplies or uh the whole defense industry's had some problems in that realm even the CEO's tend to steal a little of that here and there and uh then you get into whole areas of crime like drug usage and organized crime and as far as steps to reduce it uh i'm not sure that there's anything that hasn't been tried we might have ought to come up with something new if we could but uh you can't keep throwing money at it and well you mentioned one of my pet buzz words there which is sensitivity to it and particularly violence i uh really get uh ticked off with uh seeing this violence so much of it on TV and so forth in the movies um-hum i think that uh it does goes a lot toward uh you know like you say it gives people a kind of a makes them insensitive to it and yeah it's it's hard to judge but uh you know just thinking back i don't seem to recall my growing up days i'm only thirty three but it uh looking back on the years that i played with other kids we only played so-called war you know a few times and and then uh cowboys and Indians in my case yeah that kind of a deal as opposed to to uh you know having shooting giant cannons and all the kind of warfare that kids are playing with today you know they turn the stick into a cannon instead of a simple little gun i think kids are the answer that's uh that's where our uh hopefully the cure lies if there you know is to be one um-hum get uh get the schools uh corrected to to some extent there was another uh angle that i i started seeing as uh the Polish situation and some of the Soviet uh countries as it were uh they started coming into the news and you started hearing about some of their troubles and the like and some of their their crime problems it made me wonder just how the uh outlook of the future affects people's decisions to either commit crimes or how they live or whatever uh it seems like they the poorer the situation or the poorer the outlook the more likely they are to commit a crime yeah i think uh if you got uh that makes sense that's of course i guess one of the root causes is uh the have nots or people that are without you know um-hum well that's not of course that's not the total thing but that'd explain a lot of it and then uh i guess the drug thing is really uh become a an engine for crime here lately yeah that's true i mean it feeds upon itself not only does it make the person stagnant and not very capable of social progress in the realm of uh earning a living in the way that the norm is uh but it you know makes for a habit that has to be supported at a rate that uh can't be supported by uh that person as far as working goes i mean you can't be that much into drugs and still hold down a job capable of paying for that much drugs so um yeah it's a vicious circle in and of itself there's really uh i don't know a a bit of an eye-opener i guess even to see some of the the portions of the States United States that are becoming depressed economically and to see that the high schoolers that are coming out of school why even for the past two to three years uh there's nothing for them you know uh a lot of these rural areas college wasn't even a a consideration for the majority of them they kind of are confident that they could just move right on into industry and industry's gone from a lot of these areas and there's nothing to go into yeah so they still feel trapped and feel you know they were looking forward to getting out on their own and getting away from whatever uh family problems they had and so they just turned to whatever be it drugs or be it crime or some way to make the money to get away from the situation they're in and yeah i'd agree with that uh i guess that's not going to do anything but spread as as uh economic hardships spread and so will the the crimes of that age group i guess i've got a a brother-in-law that's on the police force and and his uh wife is a uh nurse in an emergency room and boy when they come home from work together they have the worst stories to share i mean we spent a week with them down in Corpus Christi and and just the things that they have to uh you know Spring break's a big deal and and uh he was telling me that he had to be on the scene of an accident where five teenagers all of the them drunk uh collided head on and every single one of them died three in one car and two in another and um um and uh as if that wasn't bad enough the the ones that were half alive that they rushed to the hospital and she got to work on and she got to see them die and uh and they just get all the world's worst situations very few rewarding situations uh and um that's got to be a a grim uh supper topic there grim family yeah yeah and they fortunately they have some some success stories to share and i try to tell them to dwell on those i can't see how they can both stand uh to live that way but they don't see much uh hope for neither one of them sees any real solution to the to the problems uh well it's got to be frustrating as hell for a particularly a cop you know they uh they go out and make the arrests and i guess the jails crowded the way they are before they can get the paperwork finished huh they're releasing them or they're releasing somebody just like them you know it's a revolving door that uh right has to be uh just uh beat your head against the wall of frustration you know yeah i meant to ask him the last time i was talking with him if uh if there are any circumstances under which they suspend the normal paperwork for just even a minor wreck because uh numerous times there there have been just a two car or three car incident and he starts his paperwork when you know he's gets there and then by the time they all cleared out and gone he's still sitting there doing paperwork on this deal and i said wonder what those California officers do when they have those you know twenty and thirty car pileups on the highway if it'd take a officers uh you know whole army of officers just to do the paperwork yeah well that's a uh i know that uh minor uh wrecks don't require uh police here yeah um uh you just exchange your insurance information right it just be up up to something i guess that was big enough to to call them out for well i got one one kid needing me so i'll yeah see if we get together again sometime okay Greg nice talking to you nice talking to you bye-bye bye  okay Jay i was thinking about um this topic and i was remembering that guy that does an advertisement on the radio about drug testing and marijuana whether or not marijuana causes any trouble or not and he was saying how the train had wrecked right because the guy had been under the influence and he said whether you think you know you might think that it doesn't effect anybody but it does right exactly so i think it's a good idea is what i'm trying to say well i i do too and uh uh i work for Texas Instruments and and they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in and uh i enjoy that environment i i want to be in in a you know drug free environment and i think that's a great way of uh of promoting it yeah is to have the drug testing no i can see now when you've been there a while though they were talking about random testing it seems like if there's no reason to suspect you right that i might be offended if they asked me to come in and be tested you know what i mean would you see TI just started that policy uh they they have a random uh drug testing policy and uh uh it's random in the fact that you don't know when you're going to be called but everybody will be called and how often are they doing it and uh you mean like uh how how often would you be called up uh-huh uh you may be called up twenty times and one person will only be called up once but uh you mean in a year's time or what uh over the whole process i this'll be an ongoing uh process uh from now on but in uh a year's time you might be called up i don't know twice or three times and nobody called up any uh but uh the way they have it set up or the way i understand is that they want everyone they've got it set up where all current employees uh will be called on a random basis but uh you know it's very likely that some may be called more uh more than others uh-huh because they'd be suspect or what no just because of the random process of it and uh i don't know they did talked about the the statistics of it and how they've tried to figure out uh you know to eliminate those problems but anytime it's uh it's a purely random sample uh you will have people called more more than others uh-huh well how do you feel about that but i'm i'm all for it because uh you know uh i want a a drug free environment i don't want a uh even though i do work in the the office i'm uh a financial analyst i'm probably in no danger as far as any chemicals or anything uh or machinery but i still want people in the in the office uh to have a professional demeanor about them and uh and not be under the influence influence when they come in to work and you know i guess if they have the urge and and have that habit they can do that on their own time but uh i feel like when when we're at work uh you know it's a team atmosphere and i i think that would distract from the team what if they did it though on their own time and it's still it stays in your body for such a long time well that's that's true and and to me they're still under under the influence if it's in their body and uh i don't know i that's i have a strong feeling that i'm against drugs and so if uh anyone is using drugs uh uh and it's in their system when they're tested then uh you know and TI has uh a pretty uh liberal they if you're tested positive then they automatically uh test you again and uh if that one comes back positive then they send you to a uh a drug rehab which TI pays for and uh oh that's real good that's real good uh huh what's that drug rehab and they'll send you to it so if they did have a problem they can get over it i agree with that right and uh uh so they send you to that and then they monitor you i i believe on a weekly basis you have to go in and take a test for and this goes on for several months uh-huh and uh if they if you can prove to them that you've i don't know cleaned your act up or whatever then then uh they won't terminate you but any any time during that time if they do uh if you do test positive then uh it's automatic termination hm so uh did you see that special about uh all these people that work on the road crews they're putting these bridges up and so many of them had tested positive for drugs and they they haven't been putting these bridges together correctly and like yeah and then uh on the lines for putting your automobiles together same thing they're under the influence and they're not doing the job right are you serious right now that's scary isn't it oh man that's right well and you know the same could be true at TI if somebody's putting a missile together and they uh you know mess it up and then that puts maybe a pilot or somebody at jeopardy and uh i don't know i uh-huh i think any more that uh drugs are so prevalent you know in our society that that uh it may be up to the the work place to help try to control it because it doesn't seem like any where else uh you know we're getting that assistance because in schools you know i i would hate to have a child young child right now because i think this is going to be a tough tough period for young kids with uh you know the drugs as rampant as they are uh-huh well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no i see you know and he doesn't realize the pressure that he's going to be under later when his friends start doing this right exactly or uh uh an older peer will come up to him and and uh try to try to get him hooked on it so that he'll start selling it or something you know and uh i know uh you know just growing up uh-huh i really looked up to the older guys you know especially if they played football or basketball or whatever and and uh i know that uh you know it'd be real easy to be influenced by by someone like that well i teach and last year a student that i'd had the year before so he would have been in third grade came to school with ice right golly now is this uh cocaine type and i mean it i don't i don't know what it is it's supposed to be uh real inexpensive i know that oh it is huh and anyway he's he's like a special ed child right you know and i could see he was probably selling it for these other people and we were doing these posters uh for drug antidrug campaign and all these little first graders were always drawing these pictures of ice cream trucks right and the teacher started talking to them and they said that they were selling drugs out of ice cream trucks now golly that is terrible but i mean that makes sense because uh that's where all the uh the kids are you know you have the easy access to them and uh you know uh that'd make you know that would be a logical uh-huh i tell you what these drug dealers are about the best business people there are because uh they know who the market is and they know exactly how to get to the market if uh if other businesses could do half as good as they do then uh there'd be some very profitable businesses but unfortunately they prey on prey on the young kids uh-huh but i don't know so you think we should do this in every profession uh the drug testing uh-huh i do uh i know where my father works he he works for a government contractor also and uh uh i believe any time you have a D O uh Department of Defense contract you have to have the drug testing and uh you know like uh uh athletes are starting to uh to test them for drugs so i i beli eve that it should be you know uh widespread and uh uh-huh that everyone should be tested what do you think i don't know some jobs it seems like it would just maybe be a waste of money because who cares you know i mean like i don't know right what one would be an example like should i say postal service or not i mean are they going to screw up on mail like what about your right right well what about uh teaching uh your profession do i think they should do you think they should in in that profession well see i don't really see the need of it you know how many elementary school teachers do you think are going to be on drugs right uh i guess the only the only concern i'd have you might feel like you need it by the end of the day but i don't know it would cost so much money and i think maybe we could use that money in the schools you know to buy paper or something right exactly i guess so somewhere else right especially since we're going to cut you know i guess the only fear i would have would be that uh you know if i had a child uh that one in a million first grade teachers that would be on drugs my child would be in their class you know and and well you know that's true and in teaching you don't get rid of a teacher very easy you know they'd be there that's right and and and teachers are very influential too  there we go all right well actually i'm a Dodgers i'm a Dodgers fan from way back um oh how way back i mean like um late fifties early sixties okay so Wally Moon moon shots and all that what's that yeah uh coliseum Wally Moon and all that okay yeah it's uh um yep i i'm i'm living in just west of Baltimore and uh Frederick um which is also just west of Baltimore has a minor league team and uh and Wally Moon is the manager of them yeah so he's still kicking around is that right that's interesting yeah i i also lived uh eight years in Ohio before going to uh going away to college and i used to go watch the Toledo Mud Hens oh i saw them i went i i was out there last summer i saw saw a game Ned Skeldon really is that the stadium uh i couldn't tell you for sure it's been a long time oh okay so um it used to be a uh race track uh-huh yeah um it was that was impression i got when i was there so i almost okay yeah i think that's right yeah so had a lot of fun actually i mean i like minor league baseball a lot it it's cheaper for one thing yep well that's that's true uh i've become i've kind of become a Rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here um-hum uh they've led the American league in batting fielding and pitching but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any any given year so yeah and i uh think they're in in for a odd year this year actually um they um i i don't understand why Incaviglia got released i don't either i mean the guy's twenty twenty five home runs maybe thirty eighty some RBIs i mean he you know he can't field and you know he strikes out a lot but i mean he's done that for five years why get rid of him now really i mean he really has become a a very decent fielder oh he has okay i hadn't yeah he he's he's not a the liability that he was that he used to be oh okay um oh he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys i mean with uh Detroit you know bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot yeah of course you know get a guy like Cecil Fielder uh you know if if he strikes out a lot so what yeah well is that i mean with Detroit i mean they can get away with one guy like that i mean if i if i were like if i were running Detroit i would start building the team around Fielder oh yeah but that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit all they can do is hit home runs and strike out you know which they did so right yep well i think the key for for LA this year is whether Orel Hershiser can come back i think their pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter um it may be i uh i like them a lot i i think they're going to go all the way um and and i i mean by saying i like them i like their chances i i actually don't like the Dodgers i'm a Giants fan from from way back right right well picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt no Brett Butler didn't hurt either um and Bobby Ojeda didn't hurt and Bobby Ojeda they got him from the Mets for Hubie Brooks uh who was the last one oh okay um he's uh he's pretty decent pitcher he's yes he is um okay you know who he is then yeah um and uh that guy Offerman the short stop is gonna be good yep um well it should be an interesting year yeah i'm looking i've i've already been to one game and in fact i should have been to two but are you you are you an Orioles fan um the the team i live and die with actually is the Red Sox mostly die uh but um i i go to the Orioles since they're here and i you know i do enjoy them um i was out at opening day on Monday um uh-huh right yeah yeah you know i kind of wish that they had interleague play like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the National League teams here once in a while how far is Houston uh three hundred miles ooh okay keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes yeah it is it's it's incredible yeah i um yeah we're we're pretty lucky because if if i wanna see a National League team i can usually go up to Philadelphia there you go and um you know saw you know saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year and a bunch of teams the year before boy you are a baseball fan aren't you oh uh yeah interesting um i try to see whatever i can i mean i've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years wow yeah hoping they'll do it this year because um uh um having a kid this fall so it's like well well so much for going to lots of baseball games all right yeah so so uh do it while you can yeah seriously sure well it's been good talking with you sure enjoyed it yep good talking with you and uh and uh you know you'll be happy i think in October when the Dodgers win i wouldn't mind yeah i'll be i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right yeah well God bless and uh good talking with you good talking with you take care bye bye-bye  okay do you have any children no i don't you don't do you yes i have a one a five year old daughter uh-huh did you ever have her in child care yes i do she was um at a private well i stayed off work with her for little over for of a year when she was born and then i uh-huh had her at a private sitter for i guess two two and a half years after that and how did you choose that sitter um she was referred to me by a couple of people and she turned out to be wonderful i couldn't have asked for anything better i don't think yeah i didn't want to send send her straight to a day care right and even though she was that old i still didn't want her to go to a day care yeah and this lady you would think it was her own really yeah she's real good it's hard to find people like that yes it is and um now i have got her in a Montessori school uh-huh and she's really really doing good and learning a lot and actually i've started working up there in the afternoons too so oh yeah well that's neat yeah well yeah i guess i'm going to quit as soon as school the school season's over but uh i really enjoyed being with her up there i hate it for her she has to stay that much longer but um yeah do they have classes for them during the summer too yeah they they go full uh year-round uh teach them now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips huh yeah there's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one and stuff like that it's a lot more lax but but they still go through all their uh curriculum as usual what kind of questions did you ask about that private sitter before you took her over there um gosh i can my husband and i both went we kind of give her the third degree uh good i'm glad to hear that yeah well we went over to her house so we told her you know prior well we didn't tell her we just told here we'd be over that day we didn't tell her when so that way i didn't think you you know the house would be you you know cleaned or anything for me specifically yeah right and um she had a daughter and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven right around first second grade and um at the time she kept another one other child um about a four four year old i believe but it was only like a part-time basis so we went over there and we questioned her about what she fed them and um what she did with them during the day and um you know just how she treated them how how her daughter was with the children when her daughter got home from school and stuff like that yeah and uh we really seem to be pleased with her and um did you did you introduce your daughter to her before you made your decision yes oh yes and she still loves her to death i mean when they see each other you know they just love each other to death and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter either making her clothes or buying her things really yeah oh my so we're real real lucky but after uh so she stayed with her about roughly two years and she um she had to go back to work they had some other expenses that came up so she had to go i guess get a real job yeah get a real job full time yeah so uh so what made you decide to put her in a Montessori school well i checked a lot of places out you know the kinder cares and the stuff like that and uh-huh uh i live in Garland and there's this Montessori school that's nearby yeah and um it had been recommended by some friends of ours but uh it it's an older place and so i uh checked out all the new places that were near us and then i checked that place out and uh even though it was older it was it was real comfortable and i guess kind of homey uh-huh yeah and they didn't just play all day long you know like i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went may I have some JELL-O yeah and interviewed on or interviewed at um they did a lot of play work and stuff and then they almost all of them had a Montessori section and i thought well gosh that must be pretty good huh you know if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into into their school and they made sure they pointed it out you know yeah yeah but after i looked at this place and i took Randi with me uh i think just about to every place one place i think i didn't take her and i just kind of let her go see see what she felt like doing uh-huh yeah and that place boy if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them and it's hard to drag her away so i felt more comfortable at that place that's the true test yeah and she was real comfortable and she has really really done good i i yeah it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her yeah but she seems to me to be you know pretty quick and smart and she's already reading and writing and stuff like that and she just turned five last month that's good huh that is good then so yeah i think so i mean i didn't want to rush school at her the whole time but no especially when going to spend the next eighteen years in school exactly exactly i wanted to quit my job so i could stay home with her the next five months because i know she's going to have to face that yeah really really and oh my God here we go you know i just hate that but that's right anyway so you don't have any children do you have any little nieces or nep hews then yeah yeah i have a nephew he's a little brat he goes to a really crummy day school uh my sister's not real bright so but he he's always sick i mean he has always got some kind of cold or something and i don't know i don't think this place is a very good place for him oh really oh it's just kind of convenient and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else oh really just easy to get them there and stuff yeah exactly well that's a shame yeah i don't think she checks things out very well oh really that's scary which really surprises me it is scary yeah yeah i was i was petrified because i know i would be too i mean that's a i don't know that's just it and that's why i don't mind paying more yeah um i don't know i just feel more too many horror stories out there that you know yes and that's one reason i like working up there a little bit is because i know what's really going on oh yeah that's right i think that's an ideal situation because you don't know uh because like at her school um as soon as you drive up it's got like a circular type drive they sit and they have car callers and and some kid goes out and gets the kid and it's time to go yeah huh well at first that always kind of bothered me i mean not bothered me but i thought well you know i'd like to see what she's doing you know yeah but now that i'm there i mean it's it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that dawdle uh-huh yeah you know when their parents come and it's hard to get them out and a lot of parents have places to go and and things like that and it's late at night so that's right you know now it doesn't bother me at all but is that on where the over there off of like i'm not sure what the street is is it off of near Country Club and um yeah yeah sixty six that one that's set back in the woods yeah that's it yeah okay i i've seen the signs but i've never actually seen the place itself you know it's pretty set far back off the road yeah right right it won't and that's something i like too because yeah definitely a lot of those places are like you know the one over here on seventy eight Skaggs that little Kinder Care whatever it is uh-huh yeah you know it's right there on which this is on a highway too but it's set back enough to right yeah there's a difference i'm scared i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out or or if that seems like a real accessible place to where you could you know go in and get one uh-huh yeah yep that's right or you know in a a car accident yeah and that was one of the places i had checked out yeah and it was it it was brand new when i checked it out and of course it was beautiful and clean and smelled wonderful in there but yeah you know i that i didn't base everything on that no because that all wears off that's right that's exactly right you get some kids in there and it's over quick yep but um i've been real pleased knock on wood i'm scared to death her going to public school really i don't know i well i do know why because i would be too yeah yep yeah you know drugs drugs and everything else and they talk about how soon they start that and that scares me i know it is scary i mean you're just with them do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs yeah they've um they've had police officers come in good and talk to them about it but of course they still have no concept of right what in the world drugs are you know but yeah and what to do when they're faced with it right but i just think of her you know next year she's going to be five six years old in kindergarten in same school with you know uh i guess ten year olds isn't that six sixth sixth grade you know and that's a big gap yeah it is and that's uh that i can honestly see the peer pressure there uh-huh and that just oh i can see it too terrifies me to death and stuff those kids getting snatched and uh-huh i'm i'm probably a little too over protective but nothing wrong with that well nowadays you have to be yes you do i don't i don't think there's anything wrong with that if so i at first thought you know when i didn't have kids i was going God how can you be so protective you know but uh-huh it's easy now uh-huh now you understand yeah definitely that's what i'm thinking what your mom and dad always used to say when you have kids of your own you'll understand that's exactly right and i do uh-huh but anyway well are you ever are you are you are you married yes are y'all planning on having kids or yeah we'd like to well that's good yeah that's good they're really neat it's just  so what do you what's your opinion on the our policy down there i don't think we have one yeah i was going to say it's kind of hard to have have an opinion we seem to uh whoever screams the loudest i didn't know we had one either yeah or whoever we happen to give the most money to at that particular time we seem to support without regard whether there is a democracy or a anarchy or anything else i yeah the only thing that i pretty much know about is the Central American policy where you know they're just trying to you know military action in Panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now and then well oh yeah and then of course there was there was the uh in Columbia with the drug lords but we just right talked a lot we didn't actually do anything right well that's that's what i was about to say we didn't do anything i'm actually surprised at anything in Central America along with Panama i'm just kind of surprised we did that yeah that is that is pretty risky especially after our friend Jimmy Carter gave it away anyway i mean uh-huh but i guess they had to finally do something actually Bush has been better at that than i thought um-hum he has a little more a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would i always considered him kind of a wimp he takes more risks yeah Reagan is kind of mush mush mouth yeah he was but but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is uh a combination of Reagan and Carter neither much as you know policy makers yeah it seems that the the policies of pretty much anywhere not just in Central America that US has now is is you know more action than just words than just rhetoric but you know i we we back up what we say what we say with actions uh yeah we have so far but we we really really haven't of course we really haven't taken on the drug lords yet i don't know how long it's going to last yeah i'd be interested to see if we do that well i don't think it's possible because even though you know we're against them i don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem well we did in Panama we did in Saudi Arabia yeah but no but see the thing when Panama was uh the that uh Noriega was uh was was uh was wanted for either the FBI by the FBI and therefore they had a reason but to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different it could be an interesting because interesting problem i right i don't know if they could do it or not did you read Tom Clancy's A Clear and Present Danger uh no i didn't i think you need to pick that up and read it it's quite uh it's it's quite interesting it addresses the problem oh the drug problem um-hum um-hum actually he he wrote that prior to the uh Medellin Medellin Cartel being exposed it was on the stands prior to that time it it's quite timely and either he knows somebody or he has a real good a real good imagination because its it hits pretty close to home yeah but i don't think we're going to have much of a choice in either either Central or South America i don't think uh i don't think the the uh problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon i mean you know it it i think it pretty much got sidetracked with uh with the Panama and and with the Central Central you know Middle East problems things that that are important take precedent precedence over the drugs i think i think i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front and before you know it it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing so they're going to have to go to the source um yeah i think we realize it's failed we just don't we just don't nobody wants to make the nobody wants to make the uh unpopular decision of going in and invading don't admit it yet right we still there's still there's there's still too many Kennedys and and Udalls all up there yep yeah that's true there's too many liberals in control they can't agree on anything and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes as long as somebody's getting killed as long as nobody knows about it it's okay but but the minute it hit hits the paper then of course the Kennedys and the and the Udalls the Dawes from Georgia all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is yeah of course these are the same people that also drown the and stuff like that you know but i guess it automatic i guess it's automatic respective depends on how much power you have and who you know year you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them yeah and these are the people that make the foreign policy and it it's probably basically uh i would not be surprised if the Kennedy Foundation or some of those don't have a lot of uh financial holdings in in Central and South America probably considering the Kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway every time you drink Scotch you're paying Kennedys i don't drink Scotch good don't ever drink Scotch it's terrible i quit drinking Scotch when i found out about that but anyway but uh as far as as far as you know Central and South America we our policy pretty much uh it depends on who we're what government we're buying down there at the particular time yeah i think we're trying to stay uh stay friendly with uh the uh the Brazilian and and Argentinean governments because they're producing so much uh agricultural exports yeah we don't want to piss them off and have them over produce and then because then our economy would be pretty bad yeah although we do need to do something about you know of course in Nicaragua and around there with the Sandinistas and the Contras that's been going on for years but then hell it's probably still be going on long after we're dead it'll still be the same thing yeah those people down there don't really i think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better you know the same old cliche well i think basically they can't figure out what they want down there right if you give everybody what they wanted there is a complete democracy those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education right and they'll just pick crooked people again and then people the the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again and it'll all be for nothing it's all tradition it's all traditional they have to you have the ruling class and you have everybody else yeah well i guess that's about five minutes appreciate talking to you alrighty what was that book that you were saying to read again well talk to you later Tom Clancy it's called A Clear and Present Danger A Clear and Present Danger um-hum all right he wrote he's the one who wrote uh Red October A Hunt for Red October okay all right and i think if if you read that i think you'll get a real kick out of it all right thanks a lot all right bye all right bye-bye  okay okay what's what's your most recent one that you've seen well actually what i do i haven't been to a movie theater in probably eight or nine months uh-huh so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater but i rent probably four or five movies a week really i used to do that too but i haven't been doing it lately but we've got a good video place out here and uh uh oh gosh uh i'm just trying to think of all the movies i've recently seen uh oh Air America no see i haven't seen that one uh have you seen Wild Orchid no is it good well it depends do you like uh steamy movies uh no not yet i know that sounds funny coming from a woman but usually i don't oh okay what type of movies do you like um um action i i guess one of my favorite well two of my favorite movies is probably like Lethal Weapon and Lethal Weapon Two and those are those are like two of my most favorite i mean they're just really good movies and i liked Bird on a Wire okay yeah and movies like that do you like suspense movies or do you like uh just action or um yeah some i guess like what do you mean like like are you talking about movies like Die Hard Two or oh Jagged Edge Jagged Edge was a suspenseful one or uh Fatal Attraction okay yeah i liked that that was pretty good um that was okay i i don't i guess i thought it was too far fetched but so many people said oh no it wasn't you know but i guess oh well i hope i don't run across them really that's true because i don't know i just didn't find that one to be real i i just thought it was too far fetched what was your favorite all time movie um oh gosh i don't i can't think off my head do you know which one yours was i i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most uh that i was really the most in shock with was probably uh Star Wars oh yeah well that's when that first came out i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that i mean right i guess uh out of all the movies i've i've never been as excited to go back i was ready to go back and see it again you know really yeah yeah you're right about that but that that's really like an all time classic i mean i don't think anybody anything could ever beat that now i i also liked uh oh Gone with the Wind or some of the classic like The Lawrence of Arabia see i've never seen that oh you haven't no should i rent it should i go rent it tomorrow oh yeah no that's uh that's a that's a real interesting movie and it's got a good historical perspective to it that's probably something i need to see right now because i'm taking history in school so it'd probably be a good thing for me to see oh yeah actually i just saw a movie uh called The Lost Capone oh and it's about Al Capone's brothers oh really primarily one of his brothers and i won't give the the whole plot away but it's it's really a good movie uh Al Capone had three brothers uh-huh and one of them was lost for many many years and uh he actually he turns out to be a law man really yeah it's really interesting it oh you just gave it away i guess i can't go see it no i just kidding no that's okay i didn't give away the whole thing i just gave away just enough to get you interested that does sound good is it one i guess it's a rental yeah it is okay i may have to do that go see it or go rent it and a lot of times what i wind up doing is picking say an actor or an actress yeah and seeing like all i've seen all of James Dean's movies uh-huh uh all of Mae West's movies and just kind of kind of go out and uh rent all the movies and uh uh you know just kind of go i guess you could do that you know get all of David Carradine's movies or uh um Segal to what's his first name uh-huh um i can't remember his first name it's not David is it is it David Segal i don't know he was on uh on uh uh Arsenio oh i don't i don't watch that um just recently it was really kind of interesting because Arsenio was asking him about uh really what he thought of uh one of the other action guys God i can't even remember the name he said well he wouldn't really talk about it didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such a uh a good action guy huh it wasn't Stallone it was uh i can't remember shoot i can't remember the guys name but i like all the the Rambo movies oh see i didn't really care that's that's one side of the action i guess that i didn't really care for but see i don't really like Sylvester Stallone yeah i don't think he's really a very good actor i know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful but i just have never been a Stallone fan yo Adrian hey that's pretty good no i guess like i say i just have i don't know i just have never seen any interest in him but no we we actually rent uh probably a good good combination of movies with the exception of horror films oh don't watch really very many horror films at all yeah i don't either you know i don't know there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you or something you know it's just you know yeah you're right coming out of the TV that just doesn't make my day you know well it's so i guess i'm a real i'm a realist and so when i watch movies like that it's like this can not happen so i just don't enjoy it you know because it's just like come on give me a break you know i mean i just and so many of them are done so poorly yeah yeah you know that it just doesn't even give you the effect i mean some of them are done good and they do scare you but um so many of them are just done real i don't know i'm not really into those i just saw uh uh a really interesting movie called uh Flatliners oh that was one of my favorites yes i thought that was a very good movie yeah i was really impress ed with that one i mean it was what i liked about it was that it was a new subject nobody had ever touched it before yeah you know and it was just it was done so well you know it was just it was just crazy enough for the you know students might try to do it you know i mean and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it right well that's probably true but it was a very good movie it was done real well too i mean there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like no this can't happen it seemed real it seemed real you know it was really good yeah that that was one i mean it's not my all time favorite movie but it was good it was really good yeah and um i don't know if you like this kind but i thought Pretty Woman was a really good movie too oh yeah that was a great movie yeah i've we've seen that two or three times we waited and we rented it you know but but it was really good yeah uh have you seen Shrimp on the Barbie no i haven't i don't know if i've even heard of that one it must have uh what's his name in it yeah it's got no no it doesn't no uh Hogan yeah no no really yeah Paul Hogan no really i'm surprised no it's got uh uh Cheech Marin oh really that must be pretty good then was it good yeah yeah it is it's kind of uh kind of a poor man's Pretty Woman in reverse oh but it was kind of cute actually did you see Dirty Rotten Scoundrels yes yes i though that was a really cute movie i enjoyed that yeah it was Twins was good too because when i thought of that i thought of anyway um yeah oh there was another one what's the one that just oh Dances with Wolves have you seen that yet oh you've got to see that one no i haven't i hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video it's really right that's probably true that's probably true it's it's very very good very good that's another one that i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it uh well my wife uh has got a uh a picture from Kevin Costner and he signed it it's from Dances with Wolves yeah and he signed it he he happens to be uh a friend of one of her her business associates really oh wow that's impressive and all right not not a friend a cousin oh neat a cousin so uh uh but anyhow we got uh we got a nice uh picture and it came in an envelope that says Dances with Wolves so we've got to uh try to get out there and see that one oh yeah it's really worth it i mean it's a very good movie and yes i would suggest seeing it at the theater i know that they're still playing it and they pushed it back to playing it in the theaters until like August huh i think because they were they were scheduling a video release of it in July and then when it won all those awards uh they pushed it back to August so but yeah that one is definitely worth seeing it's really good now did you see uh Driving Miss Daisy yeah and you know i didn't think that one was near as good okay you know i guess it was okay i mean it was all right but um when i compare like the winners of this year and last year it it just i don't know maybe it's it's not  well do you like to do your yard work yeah this is actually a duplex that we're in so and it's rented uh-huh uh-huh we're looking into buying a house but um the landlord is supposed to do the yard work although he doesn't do it any frequency every once in a while he comes around so in the meantime we have our own lawn mower and we probably do it a little more than him uh-huh but we don't do a whole lot since it's a rental property we've added a few things like around the patio and i've tried to get a few shrubs to grow around here but since it's you know rental we haven't spent a whole lot of time and effort in trying to do landscaping we just kind of maintain what's here and mow the grass and trim and that kind of stuff when it's needed oh great what kind of lawn do you have you mean the type of grass um yeah what kind of a grass we have oh Saint Augustine yeah it's Bermuda in the back it's the kind that has those you know grows sideways yeah that stuff oh it grows in runners right right i just love that in the middle of the summer when that gets real thick that's so nice to walk on isn't it well the problem has been in the winter of um yeah two winters ago eight nine yeah a lot of it got zapped and it's it's slow coming back like our landlord didn't really replant any last year a lot of front lawn look looks pretty bad yeah yeah yeah and he didn't redo anything so it's it's coming back a little bit now this year well you know you know mine did and it was late at this time last year i held out no hope for it but i watered and fertilized the hell out of it and i by July and August it was as strong and thick as it had ever been oh really and uh and of course this year it never really died out that much i mean this year here it is only April and it's looking good yeah we had we had a mild winter we you know everybody in my neighborhood hires their yard work done and i think i think the fun of owning a house is doing the yard work it was very mild mild winter yeah and i mean i thought so i've owned a house for um twenty five of the of the thirty two years that i've been here in Dallas and i just enjoy it so much and uh and and particularly the lawn i love it dark i love to see it get a deep dark green uh-huh i love to uh i i love to mow it i don't like weeding the flower beds around the house and my son's supposed to do that but pretty every once and a while they get ahead of him so i end up doing that for him and and my wife sometimes takes care of the flowers uh and so between us we got all our own little things to do yeah and we got we got two girls off in college they don't do anything but uh i uh and i love to be out in the summertime i love to be out when the sun is really nice and hot and just go out there and sweat a bit mowing the lawn um i just love it in fact i uh mow my lawn but there's a gigantic vacant field in back of us uh that belongs to Richland College uh-huh and everybody that we have that backs up to it mows about uh oh maybe ten or fifteen or twenty yards into the vacant lot to keep weeds from growing and coming over and seeding in your yard uh-huh so so we all even get more uh get more lawn to mow that way but uh it's fun do you back up to it on the south side or the east side uh i am on the east side of Richland in fact so Richland's on my west side when i look out my back door to see the sun set i look across the Richland field oh oh okay okay and because we had one of our uh a person similar similar stature to uh Gahouli from the legal department Mel Sharp he lives around in that area too he lives on Whiteman Place i think okay i i live on Wharton Drive okay and Wharton intersects uh uh it dead ends into Chimney Hill yeah yeah okay and then it it dead ends just dead ends up here where i live it runs uh it runs north and south from Chimney Hill north okay um uh anyway i love to do that and the other thing that i love is that i am a distance runner by hobby oh and some nights i'll come home from work like i did last night and with rain in the forecast and the lawn was getting pretty high i said i got to mow the lawn but i want to go out and run now which do i do first and i'm sitting around thinking well if i go out and run now because i messed around until almost seven uh six thirty or so if i go out and run now i'm going to get back and i'm going to be mowing the lawn and it's going to get dark and i'm going to have to guess where where the line is to mow so if i mow now then i'll go out and run afterwards and what the mowing does it limbers you up so that you go out and have a good run i finished up right at about dark and then i went out and ran four and a half miles and it was great just because the mowing it i i don't i didn't i don't have to do any stretching before running if i've been pushing the lawn mower around for an hour for an hour and ten minutes or so uh so that's just you know i just i i i just really enjoy it and i hate to here see people gripe and moan about doing uh yard work what about trees do you have any trees around we got a couple of big trees out front um i guess right along our street there used to be one of the um lines i guess there was fields here many many years ago cotton fields or something and uh-huh you bet and i remember that yeah well we have a lot of trees that that go across our front yards that are very old that must have been like where the line was in between the fields so we have couple of huge trees out front that's pretty nice no trees really in the back yeah where the fence was or something yeah yeah how how how long have you live there Maureen almost two years oh do you have children oh okay no not yet we've only been married two years oh okay okay because you've got a a excellent elementary school over there uh our middle daughter went over there one year while ours was being built here and uh Richland Park is just a super neat school oh oh and they got a lot of neat programs the uh uh how often do you when when the when the uh growing season's good how often do you have to mow your lawn uh nearly every week yeah yeah i got i got so carried away with water and fertilizer last year in uh June July and the first part of August i was mowing every four days and i talked to my parents i'm from Massachusetts originally uh-huh and i talked to my parents on the phone i said you know we Texans are a funny breed we we water we water we spend hundreds of dollars a month during the dry part of July August watering our lawn we go out and spend thirty or forty dollars a whack on fertilizer and then we bitch and gripe about having to mow it so often we said because we Massachusetters weren't like that we never did anything to it except mow it and and it always looked nice yeah that's right we never did this watering stuff everybody waters yeah we didn't do all that stuff here but they get more natural rain than we do you know we get so much rain in the spring and then we go sometimes entire June July and August without any so i guess we're where are you from originally yeah uh Philadelphia area oh okay so you've been in Texas how long eight years oh well you're you're almost a Texan i've been here thirty two years that's a long time yeah thirty two years and my wife's a Texan so of course naturally my children but they still think i'm a Yankee uh-huh and i was never called that until i came here yeah isn't that funny i wasn't either i have uh and i i was just taken aback by that yeah when i got here my uh uh best friend who was my office mate when i first got here in nineteen fifty nine said the only Yankees he could ever stand wore pinstripes suits and played baseball but but people weren't as mobile then as they are now i mean i will bet half of your neighborhood or three quarters of it and i know it's true with ours is not from Dallas is not even from Texas well i keep reminding these people that it's good thing we came down here and got some changes made like yeah shopping on Sunday i said it's a little hard to do everything on Saturday no pass no play uh kind of thing i said you know we had that for years in Ohio and Pennsylvania yeah huh yeah uh i yeah that's true that's true we did we did and uh do you all do you all uh do you all have to water a lot over there uh pretty much and our landlord always asks us to uh continue doing that even though we pay for the water because of you know foundation problems around here oh yeah because of the foundation problem you know that's an interesting thing i've had two overseas assignments with TI uh i was in uh Malaysia eighty one eighty two eighty three and eighty four and i was in the Philippines eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and i had two different tenants uh-huh uh-huh and my first one kept the inside of the house nice this is a two story five bedroom and uh uh they only lived in the downstairs because he was divorced and had two children and they only visited him one weekend a month uh-huh um and that was the only time the upstairs was so the upstairs looked as new as we left uh they only lived downstairs uh and and his wife was an interior decorator and the house was just kept very nice you know i've i've heard horror stories from other TIers that have had tenants but he didn't like yard work and what happened was the Saint Augustine grew up you know if you don't watch it and keep it trimmed back it will totally take over your flower beds um oh yeah well when we came back what used to be our flower beds were solid Saint Augustine we had to we had to dig it out and the second tenant when we went to the Philippines the second tenant he had two little girls oh uh-huh and so they lived throughout the entire house he also had a dog in the house that i didn't know about and so our carpeting was in bad shape when i got back but uh my yard was immaculate he did a great job on the yard so you so i guess you can't have everything um but but you're right and i guess that's very important because of this black earth with have here that cracks terribly uh and it shifts badly in the summertime that uh if you don't water around the foundation you're going to lose it yeah and uh and boy i'll tell you you've really got to have a conscientious tenant and it's hard for him to be conscientious when he's thinking of paying a hundred dollar water bill uh every uh uh i you know every month when you get into the June July and August time period yeah and how how big is your duplex um each side has three bedrooms and two baths living room and then a big uh kitchen that has uh dining area in it oh okay they're they're fairly big yeah uh-huh so each side is like seventeen hundred square feet yeah yeah well where uh where did you go to school uh Ohio State oh you went to Ohio State oh you're uh up in the Woody Hays country huh right and i was i was going to school in his prime back when we had Archie Griffin and we were winning all the Heisman trophies and going to Rose Bowl that was when i was going to school there uh yeah yeah yeah yeah we were really excited about the we're  why don't you go ahead and start okay my hobby is uh sewing i i've just uh started learning how to sew and uh i've taken some classes and i've made a few few garments do you sew at all i used to uh i i sewed you know in high school and when i went to college i think everything in my closet i had made but i haven't sewed since then and that's been fifteen years did you so uh you know i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college oh and uh my sister sewed and she needed the money so i would pay her and she'd make my clothes oh and uh and then just in the last you know ten or twenty i just haven't sewn anything i would love to i would like to get back to it yeah uh-huh uh clothes are getting so expensive now in in the stores and the the quality is is sometimes so poor that uh it it really is worth while to sew yeah it is you know an even back then i remember you could make something for you know half what it cost to buy and of course the quality was just exceptional right an uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because you you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it yeah it certainly is and the patterns have gone up tremendously too the prices for them you used to could get you know a pattern for two or three dollars now they're like you know five six seven eight you're kidding me oh no i'm not see i can remember paying seventy five cents for a pattern huh-uh no the the cheapest ones now are like maybe four uh four or five five dollars um-hum six seven and then you get into the vogues they get up to into twelve and fifteen and on like that good night well do you have kids and a husband are you sewing for a whole family or uh right now i'm just sewing for myself i i do have two daughters that you know out they're they're grown now though i wish that i had started sewing you know when they were younger uh-huh and uh it would have helped me out tremendously but um oh i guess i i just you know i always i have always tried to sew and uh i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything but now i i really have bought some uh new sewing equipment i bought the Serger machine yeah uh-huh and uh it really makes it look professional and i've taken some classes here in in uh Dallas well and that always is helpful for starters you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going yeah right i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes it's just there's just so many people sewing now days that's true well do you do anything else do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that uh-huh huh-uh no i'm not that talented no see i'm not i've not ever been a real craft type person i have a sister-in-law that i mean if it can be done with your hands she does it she makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces and i look at them and i think God you know i i should be able to do things like this right i have a sister that can can uh crochet real well or or knit i i guess i mean knit and she knits things like hats and uh sweaters an you know yeah yeah well when my sister oh when my sister had her first uh child my niece and this is we're talking fifteen years ago i was it was my last year of college bed throws uh-huh uh-huh and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares so she did and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby oh and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time uh-huh and when we broke things off actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college so when we broke things off i quit crocheting it and i've never picked up a needle since then in fact i think it's still sitting in the top of the closet oh my goodness one of these days i keep thinking i'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread but yeah now now they have the uh knitting machines that will do it for you fast um-hum my problem i guess is time you know i i talk to my husband we kind of planning for the time eventually when you know maybe i can quit work while my kids because i my kids are young i have a three and a half and a two year old uh-huh um and he says but Bev i think you'll be so bored because you know all you've ever done is work and i said but there's so many things i want to do i'd like to start sewing again i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these you know knit these things and i think that would be fascinating he kind of laughs yeah are you familiar with what a Serger is uh the Serger sewing machine i don't think so well you know in when we used to sew we'd sew the seam and then we'd finish the edges and we we would uh trim the seams and finish the edges sure uh-huh well this machine does it all in one step it's you're kidding so like as you're sewing the seam it's finishing off the inside edge right and it's cutting off the uh the there there are two knives and it cuts off the uh you know excess seam allowance well that takes all the work out of it right and uh it it really makes it look professional well how neat especially on you know i mean from the inside you know how you look under under something that you've made and it doesn't really uh-huh but uh the Serger really makes it look professional well that's neat they're pretty expensive i like i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine for the machine yeah uh-huh so since i bought it and paid that much for it i guess i'd better might as well get some use out of it yes i'm going to have to do it you have to learn how to do it that's right otherwise they hold it over your head forever right right now i bought you that machine well that sounds really good ah yeah do you paint or anything like that no no i i play the piano never oh so do i oh you do except well i have one here it's the one that i grew up with and my folks gave it to me and uh a couple years ago when they uh they sail and so they sold their home and they they've been sailing and uh uh-huh so it's here but i haven't touched one like since college so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again and of course my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it and i'd love to teach them to play too uh-huh yeah so i'm not great but i remember it uh-huh well i'm not that great either i used to be a lot better than i am now i i have played for uh the church choir and uh yeah i played for the choral club in high school and but i you know i don't practice a lot anymore and uh you know you get rusty you do you really you do i never thought i would get rusty but i'm rusty now well i i figure it takes practice and i i don't i say i don't have the time that's not true by the time i put my kids in bed at night i don't want to do anything uh-huh yeah i you know i've worked all day and i come home and i do that i and you know even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that i i think gee i could do this or that i have an hour here i don't want to do them sometimes i'm too tired right uh-huh yeah right so i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though uh-huh well sewing does take up take an awful lot of time takes an awful lot of time now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out if if somebody would lay it out for me then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it i could do that all day long and i i can remember once in high school i wanted some extra money yeah and my mom wanted some pants so she laid out the material and i cut it and sewed it and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants yeah but i i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and make sure it's on the right lines and not on the bias and yeah on the on the right on the straight grain and all that stuff uh-huh yes on the grain of the fabric it drives me crazy yeah that that's that's the part that i don't like too yeah yeah i i like sewing sewing up the garment itself i really like to do that but the the cutting and the all the even the cutting i don't like well what are some of the other features on this machine it sounds wonderful well that's about it really it's it has four uh four threads instead of the the regular basic two threads oh okay and uh it's is that for designs or is that for the regular seam in the fabric or no you you can either use three or four of the threads oh okay uh it's kind of it the stitch is kind of like a knitting machine like the they're loopers under the bottom and then the there's a seam stitch and it's the loopers that form the the edge you know that edge finish uh-huh and uh that's what really makes it look professional you can do a lot with the Serger though you can make uh piping and cording and uh you can use all kinds of different uh textures of thread so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do and well yes but you you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine you can't throw your sewing machine away you you you need it to do things like button holes and uh uh-huh seams that need to be really strong need to be done on the sewing machine so the Serger is not a sewing machine itself it's something that goes with it it's uh like an attachment or no it's it's a it's a it's a machine it's not exactly a sewing machine but it does it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff but there are other are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do like you can't top stitch with it oh okay you know you can't do top stitching or um there's there's a few few things that you just can't do with it it will also do a rolled edge um uh-huh gee it's just so versatile like i remember well i'm going to have to go check it out that's just something i hadn't heard of but it  all right um there was a crime here in McKinney uh a rather heinous murder there was no um remorse shown by uh uh-huh at least one of the perpetrators and yet for whatever reason um his crime was not considered a capital crime uh-huh uh-huh an and quite honestly i i feel very strongly that the man has the has no redeeming social values and if if and when he comes gets free again he will have no compunction but to complete that that same kind of lifestyle i mean continue that same kind of lifestyle and perhaps do the same thing again so it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever really i think that i don't know i don't i don't think our prison system isn't set up where we um rehabilitate or you know restore anybody i think it'll only make them worse but i i believe that God can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it but that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow and if you do kill a person and it is you know you're found to be guilty i believe God establishes the authority of our court system and i believe that you know that i do believe that capital punishment is uh alternative even you know God can still change your heart but that doesn't mean like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card or the shopaholic you know you get your life right with God but you still have to pay your Visa bill you still have to that's that's right you know so but God sent us his grace and they give pardons but i believe if it's a genuine conversion there's a genuine and those prison people know they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character they see that and i i worked in a prison in Fort Worth but yeah did you yeah i have a degree in social work you see it you know the ones that have a genuine character change it is obvious and they know that they're they're not going to pardon someone from the governor uh-huh you know what i'm saying they're not going to go without going through every channel of authority in the prison so i feel like you know that's is there is occasions where there are they do spare lives and you know i leave that with the governor who of course is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected so yes but my concern is first of all that not all all persons who i think should be receiving capital uh whatever capital uh that uh that uh-huh hum punishment thank you i'm sorry i just got home from work and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit uh that not all of them are being um punishment uh-huh no that's okay convicted of it that that the the they're not even being charged with that appropriate i agree with you that that a person's heart can be changed uh-huh but the same God that can work that miracle also established the laws that said um for certain kinds of sin certain kinds of sins certain kinds of of uh breaking of the law there would be a capital punishment right then it was it was uh almost immediate as soon as as the trial was over then it was stoning we don't have a speedy trial we don't have speedy um punishment and so it kind of loses its meaning if you sit on death row for months and years uh-huh right but in in the Old Testament yeah and so forth right we don't well yeah we definitely have lost the Judeo-Christian ethic of the judicial system for sure but the base the base is still there the foundation is still there though but of the system but i know what you're saying uh but also they're under a law because we haven't been removed from the law we've just been taken out from under under a law because under the law if your child mocked back talked you he would be stoned that's correct yeah under the law he would be stoned so we've been removed from the law of under from being under the law but we're still you know we're still accountable to it we don't need to back talk but you know it's like God changes your heart to not do that he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust because in the Old Testament they could look all they wanted just couldn't do it but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and those and then any of if i don't think see if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree that this person needs to be excused i believe for murder uh rape i even believe incest things uh-huh that will permanently damage uh the character of the child i believe crimes against children should be punished but by by death i believe i tend to agree on that very strongly sexual crimes unless there's a true change of character and that's where we just have to to trust the authorities and they're not going to excuse people if it was was run like that i don't there would probably be very few exceptions to that and if it was done quickly and done swiftly and but it's not because the judicial system has rejected they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have pretty much plus the all the judicial system is overloaded with all kinds of um problems and crimes and so forth and then all of the um civil things that clog the courts right uh-huh and having sat on both uh uh criminal and a civil uh jury some of what goes through our courts is a total waste of time uh-huh yeah because we're suit happy but but back to the to the capital situation sounds like you and i have a lot of of of uh common ground at least as as far as as yeah yeah capital punishment is concerned i would like to see some some kind of reform or some kind of streamlining so that if a person is um convicted uh-huh and sentenced to to death that that automatic appeal which goes in could be more quickly dealt with uh-hum yeah and and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family or or any of us the taxpayer any good to have him sitting around for months and years yeah anybody yeah yeah an an but him could be a her right but you see i know in Jamaica uh it think it's Jamaica i think it's Jamaica i know that they have you know crimes punishable by death and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then and i wouldn't want to be one of them that are not guilty but i know that they have like uh their crime rate it's not Jamaica i don't think i can't remember which it's uh one of the Caribbean Islands and and they Singapore is it like that my husband's going Singapore and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law and the law is enforced and that's what what when you have lawlessness i mean the law's not being enforced and all that does is lawlessness we were we went on a mission trip to Manhattan and to the Bronx and stuff two years ago and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack and everyone was out uh we were across from that big bus station i forget what you call it but anyway and everyone they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence and within two hours there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing um and you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days that's sad because there's no the answer is not being given to them in the court system and i think initially when our country was set up it was set up with God and it was really an integral part and no you can't you can't force people but i think people are hurting and they're out doing crack sitting on the street they were the kind of people that i think mostly we would want to receive it if it was presented to see i don't know i guess i'm kind of frustrated that you know we've gotten away from the Christian basis that our court system was founded upon i mean it reeks of the Bible just the whole thing the whole system and so i feel like if that was presented more openly and not just relying upon and para church ministr y to come in and do it but that the system itself you know you know what i mean yeah i feel like that might be better if it was run on a more scriptural basis which would include you know you know and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with however certain uh very liberal minded groups who do not um subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do such as the uh civil liberties unions and so forth right will lobby against that and hold that out as long as they have breath which is most unfortunate because we all lose out when people go so far out to the extreme on either side right yeah yeah because too too often they're can be extremism that that hurts from from any direction regardless of whatever whatever you're arguing or concerned about and right right we all lose out yeah i know you're right they would lobby that and and i see that and that's why you know i'm like okay what's my role in this thing you know what's my part because i don't think the system is going to get fixed i think it's crippled yeah  hi Jim the um well how do you get the most of your information uh generally the most of my information i'll get in the morning with my newspaper uh-huh periodically updated through the day i try to catch the news at least once before i go to work either on TV or on the radio most days it's just catching it on the radio drive on the drive in to work uh-huh do you enjoy mainly network news or like CNN uh for world events i'll take CNN any day yeah any day yeah but for local local coverage or statewide coverage i'll take the local news yeah a lot more indepth do you um do you do you get them do you feel like the newspapers are generally biased either liberal or conservative views i extremely so i that's how it is here too that one newspaper is very liberal one of them is very conservative and there's no mid ground anywhere in it uh doesn't seem to be um granted i i i read primarily the more controversial topics so i'm sure that it's easier for them to uh be you know polarized more so on the topic on the the news items that interest me most but uh it doesn't seem like there's much middle ground in either of the papers with what i'm involved with doing is kind of a controversial job anyway really i work with the uh state prison system so i'm always kind of interested i look at the what the liberal view is on the inmates need more rights and i hear the more conservative lines that we need to get back to making the punishment fit the crime but they never do go far enough yeah after four years with the system i've got an extreme almost an extremist view on get into the criminal justice system uh-huh because what they got now sure isn't working well i think that it's been proven since somewhere in the early nineteen hundreds that rehabilitation in the forms that we have been attempting it is not realistic um i can't remember the study but it was there was a quite a long-term study done in Europe that uh evaluated the incarceration systems that America has based their systems on and uh it's been proven useless for rehabilitation uh which is what a lot of people tend to believe happens in a prison and um there are amount of reforms that could be helpful in that area are numerous and costly and would require require a lot of task forces and et cetera and um there is a lot of people in our country that would go right off the roof um are do you work with the inmates themselves yes that's i'm a inside guard i also work in the segregation department for the ones that mess up goodness yeah so i get the real sweethearts but i get a aside aside from that i i'd almost say i've got extremist views on gun controls on personal crime convention uh personal crime prevention to to which end there was a thing recently in the paper there was a bill in front of the state legislature that was going to allow the average citizen to be able to pack his own weapon again uh-huh concealed or unconcealed i'm all for that why is that do you think the average citizen has the the um uh the wherewithals in order to use it i don't know if every citizen does or not but just you having lived in Houston you know what it's like out there it's when i go to a shopping mall if i i feel under dressed if i'm carrying less than two blades from the training i had in the military i'd rather take somebody with a blade at close range than i would with a pistol because i know they're going to go down i know i can keep them down uh-huh but if the if the option came up to where i could pack a side arm in the open i i don't worry about carrying it concealed i want them to know i'm packing it yeah uh-huh and given the option of that i would definitely when i went shopping to the malls i would definitely be packing all kind of power firepower yeah i uh i i lived in a part of Houston that was uh unpleasant i lived south down in uh the Montrose area Wisdom City okay yeah and it was it i was um keenly aware of the the the danger in my area um my roommate was attacked and she got away unharmed but scared to pieces and had had all of her clothing ripped off of her um and then i had another friend that was also approached and got away and this was in broad daylight both times so i was keenly aware of the danger in those areas but i didn't i guess i didn't feel like i was competent enough with any kind of weapon to to carry one or to feel like carrying one would be a benefit to me rather than just having them take it you know i mean that's i that's that's truly how i felt i felt like if i were carrying something and if i actually pulled it on somebody that was trying to attack me that their chances of getting it from me would be higher than my chances of using it effectively on them that's where the only stipulation i'd like to see tacked on to the legislation saying that there had to be some form of formal firearms instruction N R say NRA certified firearms instruction uh-huh you can't train somebody how to shoot in a combat situation until they've been there i've seen it in Lebanon i was in in the Granada invasion in eighty three uh-huh i was an advisor down in Central America in eighty four i'm very accustomed to knowing when i pull a piece out whether it's a full sized firearm or a handgun uh-huh when it clears leather shot the shot's going to be fired you don't pull it out for show you pull it out to take care of business the same way with the blade it it comes out of my back pocket or it comes out of a sheath on my web gear it's coming out and it's going to draw blood you don't pull it trying to think is it uh in the Gurkha forces out of India had a legend that went along with their legendary side arm the Khukri which is their blade uh-huh uh-huh you never drew that thing out unless it was going to draw blood which is a good huh mental training aspect for it uh-huh that that or any side arm whether it be a blade or whether it be a handgun or whatever uh-huh oh i feel that is certainly if you're going to carry one you need to be uh very comfortable with the piece and have enough uh knowledge and insight for your own self on whether or not you're going to use it in that situation and not pull it unless you intend to because i i feel like that's you know i mean i'm i'm i'm all for uh people having having firearms or having whatever form of protection they prefer because you know even though the odds is you know the criminal ends up getting the gun and shooting the people to begin with you know the people that had it in the beginning but if the if if you're talking about uh two people if you're talking about a criminal an assailant that is coming at you with a gun and you don't have a gun at all well the chances are a hundred percent they're going to get you if you if you both of you have a firearm you've at least got that fifty percent chance that you may get them first and so i believe in that but i i've not ever felt comfortable in it i guess it's i'm glad i i'm glad i um i'm that i'm married to someone who feels comfortable with them you know it's it's one of those things um i was reared in Texas so t here's also a moral aspect to it a lot of people have not either mentally sat down and gone over the moral aspect can i take human life even in a life threatening situation to myself or to a loved one uh-huh and when it actually comes down they don't have time to think about it uh-huh in that fraction of a succeed that they're caught i don't know if i can do this there's a bullet already on the way to them or there's a blade already cutting them somewhere because they they had the time to react but they hesitated uh-huh yeah and that's impossible to in a classroom setting explain that to somebody they've got to on their own have made that decision long before they ever decided to carry a weapon of any type whether it be a fighting staff uh-huh up to a forty four magnum any any of them in the correct hands they're an absolutely fantastic weapon uh-huh but if you haven't made that moral decision can i take a human life even under those situations where either my life or a life of a friend or a life of a family member is threatened yeah can you do you defeated the purpose of even having the gun uh or the or whatever the weapon is uh i agree i agree that would be something that would have to be uh evaluated i feel prior to ownership the uh i think a lot of people hear only the sensation stories of this child being killed or  all right what do you think about it like well you can go first well uh i guess uh i hadn't hadn't had a lot of time to think about voters but uh wow i dropped the phone that was loud sorry uh i i guess i voter apathy of course i is uh is a universal thing uh not just i don't think just United States really i think other places have uh-huh the same problem and it's basically because the voters don't really feel like that their vote really has any influence on the outcome not just of the election but of the results of the election the uh the congressman and the senators and you know the legislators don't really do uh-huh uh most of the time what the what the their constituents uh really want them to do uh-huh uh they do what they think is either best for the you know the the uh economy or whatever's best for the people that are the lobbyists that are paying you know part of their way yeah and and and i think it's you know the voters don't feel like they really have as much say so in the government as uh they would like to have so they they kind of drift away because of that uh-huh really i think that that's a big part of it i think that's probably the root and then also that added with all the pressures on the American family today it's a real it's a real pain for us to go vote i mean huh yeah i remember the last time that we had to go vote it was like man just to get up there and do it was major effort you know right and we ran in there it was like right at seven and my husband had worked late and i was going to go we wanted to go together to do it and take our son but it was like we ran in and whew we were the last people in there and i thought you know Kyle gets off usually about oh by five but we live in Tarrant County and he drives from Dallas so you know it's a drive but he still had a lot more cushion to be able to go vote a lot easier than most people you know what i mean right and because he doesn't hit the North Dallas traffic and all then he might have worked an hour late it was just like ah we had so many things to do and we just couldn't get them done and i i remember thinking that man it i'm a Christian and i really feel like we have a responsibility to vote but i tell you what if i wasn't a Christian i would there's no way i would have gone to vote just because of the pressures uh-huh the you know just the time factor and just the anyway and i felt like i was listening to Dobson this morning and i i guess i even thought that then this morning so it's funny i got this topic because there were talking about how the Congress it pays the Congress to make you know legislation that encourages women to work outside the home because then you have two people you can tax and you you put both of those people in a higher bracket uh-huh and that it's probably not going to end anytime soon the pressure you know to work and just the pressure it puts on the American family and um i i thought about that and i said yeah that's funny you hardly have time to go vote for this Congressman because you know women are expected to do so much now and i just kind of laughed and i thought God i never thought of it like that you know uh-huh so anyway i think that's the other side that yeah i think that's that's a good observation and and true yes uh yeah but i agree too with what everything you said but i think the two go and then you put those two things together and you're going to have you know no one going to vote but then um i don't know disillusion what's the solution yeah oh what's the solution huh start over again you know that's we've the people have talked you know about having about redoing the Constitution completely or changing the government a little you know to some extent i know now come on uh-huh and i think that's a you know we really ought to take a long hard look at at the system and and see if there's a way to improve it not just say that's the way it is or it's been that way for two hundred years let's you know see if there are some some improvements uh not a not a change but some improvements i think the system itself basic system is but i think that is uh appropriate but i think there are some some modifications even that could be made uh uh-huh limitations on Congress and restrictions you know restrictions that could be put on on the government itself uh-huh to get them out of our everyday life yeah there's yeah i know they're i know you can't even spank your children these days without uh-huh you know with this you know i don't know you we don't have we don't have a little child but i know that when you go in a restaurant we had some foster twins and it was last year and it wasn't through the state but boy howdy man these kids needed a whipping sometimes not to be beaten not to be abused but to firmly be told you are not going to do that and you are not going to spit in my face i said no yeah he uh-huh and if you do that this is going to be the consequence but it you couldn't do that even through the state even the mother it wasn't through the state but even though um the mother really would given approval but because of the situation we just didn't think it was wisdom you know you go in a restaurant and they start spitting their food out at the table now come on but you know you couldn't do really a lot because of the state's control so that's that's a good idea there too i like that but uh-huh anyway you know have you ever had a two year olds twins start spitting their food at you at Luby's you know i mean you're like going i mean yes uh yeah i i remember our our our daughter's twenty five uh-huh and i remember when she was at you know at that age and and how she was and that that's exactly of course there was only one of her it wasn't twins uh-huh but that's exactly the you know the way it was and of course twenty five years ago you could you could uh you could you could go in the bathroom at Luby's and take care of it yeah yeah you could could uh yeah i did i stood there and i did take care of it it took forever though and i think God just had some grace there because i don't think if it had been my child i don't think that would have worked what i did in order to get them to eat that food you know uh-huh but it took like twenty five minutes but it was the whole thing was the state but i don't want to rewrite the Constitution i just wish people i wish it would be interpreted like the founding fathers wrote it to be interpreted by uh-huh right and that they would begin to teach it in the yeah i guess the the Constitution is not the part that needs to be changed it's the right our society is so messed up though it's like no wonder they interpret it wrong we were in Dallas last night and we ate dinner at Meadow Road and seventy five at a restaurant there it's the rest of it huh you know the uh-huh and i couldn't believe it it was like this kid was like Saturday Night Live we were the only normal seeming human people in the whole place almost and i'm not kidding and it's like these it's this it this i told Kyle i said if this is reflective of our society no wonder we are in such a mess and yeah well i t's there are some some strange things you know these were the rich people these were the you know these were i mean just the things that happened we had a bulimic in front of us and she just looked crazy but yet she had money uh-huh and um she was just so friendly and i asked the manager as we checked out i said is that lady a ballerina or what and he goes he said no she's a bulimic um because she was so skinny and then all these other people are coming up around us and yeah uh this one man they went to check on their ticket and the other man at their table started taking their plates and and in fear just piling their food on his plate and shoving it in his mouth i mean this was in one night and i was just sitting there thinking now you're yeah you're kidding i he did it's like said they you mean it's that at a like a stranger a total stranger uh no he was sitting at the table with um another couple oh he was sitting at the table with them right but he took their plates up and made sure they didn't see him and i think he was the one i heard him mention about the tickets were messed up so they went to take care of the tickets he took their plates and began eating his eating their food i'm not kidding my husband was like totally freaking out he said i can't believe it look at that but and i you know what i mean i they were right next to us and it was obvious that they didn't know and so and he ate it all before they got back and everything and so yeah i just thought no i don't know if there's an answer to the people not going to vote when they when our society is falling apart like it is i don't know if people yes yeah maybe we don't want those people voting i know yeah i know and they you know these are probably some of the lobbyists in Washington i can't help but think that either yeah yes yeah that's that's is it no seriously because these were this was a nice North Dallas this was not we weren't over on Cedar Springs or Harry Hines or anything you know yeah yeah that's uh so anyway i think our society is just worse off than i realized that's what i thought that's i'm going to have to start going out to eat more often i'd i guess i would like to see some things like that we live in Euless now we don't see that in Euless too much but you know that's what it i mean it was just absolutely maybe it was just that night right yeah a a full moon last night or something but i don't think so i i have a feeling that's more reflective of our government and everything then yeah well that's our time well there's your another call well i think we had a good call and so okay have a good day bye okay yeah i enjoyed it thank you uh-huh okay bye-bye  well what's your views on it i personally feel like as long as the Soviet Union exists it's going to be a threat to the United States and sure an anybody that's got that much military might is going to be a threat that's right and i i think that we've made a lot of strides in the last several years with them but i don't feel like that we can ever turn our back on them and not yet no i i just think that course we're in a good position they're they're quite dependent on us right now yeah but that doesn't necessarily mean anything but i don't know the i and i i have to wonder sometimes how much of their dependence is um you know if it's it's sort of a false dependence just to while they're building their own uh way of doing things that they're making us think that they depend that much on us so that we don't watch them more closely you know i'm very suspicious of them well i don't know i yeah i mean first and foremost i mean everybody loves Gorby but you know that the one thing they have to keep in mind he's a communist and communists have their own little ideology about the way things are going to be yeah that's right i think i think they're in pretty bad shape right now i i think their i think their reliance on us is is probably real course that's not to say that once we get them on their feet again things won't go back the way they were that's right so i don't know and i don't know you know they they want to know what it would take to convince us that they aren't a threat and i don't know that there's anything that can be done to convince us of that because you know we just see how if if you let your guard down in any situation how you know how quickly that Persian Gulf situation arose uh-huh um i don't i i don't think that that we can ever be convinced as a country that that they're going to change or you know not be a threat well only unless they change their form of government yeah and even even the strides that were made toward that though uh you know Gorbachev seems to have he seems to have lost his steam in in that direction and you know he seems to be repressing his own people again and i don't think that i think that a lot of the the forward progress that was made came to a halt you know in the middle of that Persian Grulf Gulf crisis uh-huh uh-huh well it's going to be interesting in the next few years to see what happens because there's quite a strong democratic um um group over there yeah see so many of them have gotten a taste of of democracy and they're kind of in between right now they're they're not uh they're not getting the benefits of being a democratic place but they they know what they are and uh the country tells them that you know this is what it's like to be a democracy and they're still hurting um-hum uh-huh so you know they're getting i guess the worst of all worlds right now um yeah well there was a interesting cartoon in the editorial the other day it was a there was a picture of a shop keeper with this really mean look on his face and empty shelves in back of him and a little rat and a couple of spider webs and uh a couple of Russians walk in and look at it and say well we have the worst of both worlds communism and capitalism that's true but you know i i i think that i think or at least i hope that they understood that's what was going to happen now you can't go from a a communist economy to a democratic one and expect things to be great overnight right it's just like Poland and East Germany and East Germany i mean the the only saving grace for East Germany is that West Germany had lots of money yeah that's right and uh they're bailing them out on everything but even even now the West Germans are grumbling uh-huh you know which i i would hope they had thought about that while they were busily engaged in tearing down the wall i mean they talk about unification unification and now they're unified and now all they can do is gripe right uh-huh but oh well i don't know it's one of those things that all looks good on paper but putting it into reality is a whole different ball game yeah yeah i know we we've shoveled so much aid to Poland and i don't know of course you don't hear hear the bad things out of there like you used to but it doesn't mean they're not going on it just means the press decided to cover something else that's true that's right yeah of course you know you always wonder about the information you're getting anyway that's right i you know that's another thing the news media in the in the Soviet Union i wouldn't trust them either you know i wouldn't trust them to send to send a story about the United States to their people correctly huh-uh huh-uh huh-uh and uh there has been a lot more openness yeah um we can only hope that that continues it's a precursor of things to come i think our next biggest threat is the Japanese Japanese yeah yeah first economic battle we've ever been involved in yeah yeah it's like our car industry and it would have it would it would have gone under a long time ago if it hadn't have been for the Japanese helping us out yeah and i guess they they feel a bit ashamed they've done so well yeah well here's the poor United States they helped us get on our feet so let's help them it's amazing we got a lot of problems here too i do mean yeah and and and i have a real problem with the government you know giving away things to the the other countries that have as as much ability to to do harm to us as anyone uh-huh and you know like giving them plans plans for the some of the uh top secret aircraft that we have and things like that i mean that's ridiculous that is only asking for trouble yeah well it's like it's like Saddam you know we're going to build them up and then have to go in there and take care of them yeah so that's exactly right well gosh i can't think of anything else nope me either well i guess that'll about do it okay same here have a good weekend bye-bye good talking to you you too bye-bye  well what's your views on it i think it's uh a good idea um i grew up uh my teenage years were spent during the sixties graduating uh high school in sixty eight um i remember when the Peace Corps movement first came about and i thought it was a very good idea at the time i was one of those uh Kennedy children if you know what i mean and uh uh-huh right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school have no idea what they want to do yeah and there's a lot of things out there that we could do uh for our own country let alone other countries and i think that we've got the the people power to do it it's just uh we need sure sure to channel it and focus it on some things that that need some fixing up um yeah some examples are this uh some of the things like Jimmy Carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people uh-huh and there's a lot of housing ah i know in the area that i live in that's run down and beat up but it could be fixed up and used and it's just you know sitting there wasting away yeah uh-huh yeah we're not too far behind i graduated in seventy one so i'm i'm same generation i i'm it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you i i think uh i don't i don't even think it ought to be uh voluntary i think it ought to be mandatory uh for kids to either either do military service or public service one of the two uh a lot of reasons for that not not just because i'm a i'm a hard ass or anything it's just that uh-huh like you say kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus and i think that it might stop us some problems later on i mean you know you these kids will get their their heads on straight and and figure out what they want to do instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something uh it's i think it would be good for them uh it helps mature them a little bit and helps them understand the world the way it really is yeah i think a lot of people grow up with uh with uh preconceived notions like what the world's about oh yeah a lot of it has to do from too much TV oh yeah yeah and uh you know it's there's there's a heck of a lot of difference between you know the intake that you get from TV and and movies and what you hear in school and then what reality is uh-huh uh i remember uh i've i've worked since i was well i started delivering papers when i was ten and i had a real job when i was thirteen so i've you know worked most of my life but i remember when i got out of high school all through high school was boy i can't wait to get out of high school i can't wait to get out of high school and i wanted to go to college and i had the grades to go to college and i got accepted to college but when i got out of high school i kind of said you know what am i going to do now you know it's like uh-huh you know when i actually started working full time and i i got married shortly after getting out of high school i uh thought i was smart ran away and got married and uh i remember there was a time and within the first year of marriage i said boy wouldn't i give to get be back in school uh-huh and just have to do homework and and go work my part time job because life and the reality of working for a living and trying to make ends meet is just so overwhelming to someone yeah yeah if they aren't prepared for it and and most of them aren't i mean you look you look at the number of marriages that are occurring right out i mean even in high school that's true and you know you you wonder where are the parents in all of this you know why isn't somebody stepping in and and stop putting a stop to this kids in high school are just too young to be married they have they have no idea what the world is like they don't how tough it is out there to make a living yeah yeah a uh i mean i was in the same boat when i left high school i my parents wanted me to go straight to college and i didn't you know i was ready i was ready i had wanderlust i wanted to get out and see some things so i joined the Air Force and ended up staying there for thirteen years um um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem yeah and i i did a lot of growing up there uh yeah i think once once kids get out and see how other people really live and know how bad off some people really are and how good they've got it uh-huh yeah that's right and what it takes to have that good life and if you're willing to work for it then they're probably be more inclined to work for it that's right uh-huh well you know it's just like you say there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country and uh you know if if you could have a thought of something like uh like a uh uh a Peace Corps sort of organization i mean this would be so useful just in uh for instance just helping old folks uh-huh exactly you know they you know they need help they don't have anybody to depend on and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house or do minor repairs or something like that and you know i've i've so i my my parents are in their late sixties now and um so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore yeah and it's it's really hard on them and the you know the thought that i i see the uh the mall rats you know walking around the mall nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long when they could be doing something to help someone uh yeah and uh you know you there's a uh a nice warm feeling i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger i mean i was a Boy Scout and the whole bit and yeah yeah my mom's in the same position late sixties and and it got to the got to the point where i mean me and my brother both were were gone and she couldn't maintain the house without large expenditures of money you know it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment yeah and uh i i'm not i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things you know like the like the yard work and little repairs and painting and stuff like that yeah i think there'd there'd be a you know a uh economic benefit for you know everyone concerned those doing the work and those receiving the the uh the services oh yeah sure sure i mean i mean the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money you know that i i remember when i was a kid i used to do little little things for the old folks around the neighborhood and uh i know how it made me feel yeah you know you so uh people people just don't help people anymore they're they're out for themselves yeah i think uh President Bush covered that in his uh State of the Union address this year when he said that you know it's time for you know the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything yeah well that's that's the that's the point we've gotten to you know every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government and you the government's going to be limited i where are they going to get the money they're going to get it from us and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program yeah exactly um the thing that Carter works on uh Habitat For Humanity i was involved in that was uh in Montgomery before i came up to North Carolina uh-huh and u h it was it was a pretty neat little program we'd just go out and they would buy a plot of land and contractors and builders and everybody else would donate their their time and uh the materials were at cost and we'd put up houses and that was kind that was kind of neat i uh in a way i think it's a little bit inefficient but but it's better than nothing yeah and and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing um course on the other hand i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves but just won't yes because it's far more advantageous for them to sit there and just draw uh welfare money than it is to work uh we did a uh a cost comparison in one of my courses and we took all the benefits that a family that a a married couple with two kids would get under welfare and what they would be making at minimum wage and they came out four thousand dollars better a year by taking welfare yes so there's no incentive for them to do anything far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money yeah one of the things they tried to push through in Maryland and uh weren't very successful was that if you were an able bodied person on welfare you had to do something you had to do some work and yeah and and and that's been tried that was tried in Alabama too and it got shot down yeah i don't and i don't understand the reasoning for it i really don't it it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money then they should return something to the public i mean if nothing else go out along an interstate and pick up garbage that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do yeah what do they what do they do in Maryland do they use highway people or do they use prisoners um both yeah that that's the way they did it in Alabama too yeah they use both usually usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there picking up trash uh they have a they have another program in Maryland that's called Adopt-A-Highway uh-huh uh-huh yeah we have that here in North Carolina  here we go okay um now we're supposed to talk about social activities right well the changes that's occurred like it how was it maybe ten twenty thirty years ago as opposed to what it is today uh-huh how we're living socially in comparison to maybe from that time period from ten twenty or whatever you remember it to be i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh uh they're they're they're polite they have more respect for other people just in in general i think and just just towards people and property and um i i guess they would would be more conservative some of them i guess yeah we are uh somewhat conservative but as far as the uh socially our crime rate has increased and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like uh-huh violent crime is on the increase from what i've seen and um our prison population has significantly increased i would say um our economy too is really it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read and uh-huh uh even the well it started spiraling down i suppose in the seventies and uh our recovery uh economically has not been like it used to be to me also our nuclear family is is not the same because more people are living together that aren't married uh uh-huh uh-huh i don't i don't know if uh can't make any judgments of that nature but uh i don't really want to either because i have no problems about it either way uh-huh and um kids are i i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to yes i agree with women are more on the rise too so far as getting their careers established and uh they don't no longer feel dependent upon men uh-huh well well do you think that that maybe i mean uh i've heard different you know like um like i know my mom and like other ladies they complain because they think that um the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids that's probably true i mean they they are a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care or having more with baby sitters and especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands and uh i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected uh-huh yeah uh in fact uh there was one lady in this area she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day oh my gosh just a baby not a baby uh she was old enough to uh i would say she was five to eight years old somewhere along that range but that's just an extreme example i would imagine you know the situations are out there oh my gosh uh-huh yeah um well as um well i think the education like our education has um increased dramatically but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things like we should know i agree there like i i think well um in the morals and values of like my generation for the most for most people are totally different from the morals and valleys um values of like per se your generation but i think as we get older it gets to your you know what i mean i think the kids now are are i would say louder now until after they reach like twenty five and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things yeah um i could agree with that because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age uh-huh yeah because i think we're given more now whereas you had to work for everything and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work and you know and they they don't have any intent to go working until they have to uh-huh that's an agreeable topic there um what else considering beside family economics um our transportation system has changed for us i mean we can it we can now travel around the world in no time it's just a hop skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast and um uh-huh well i i think what's happened too is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day uh-huh and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there we got to constantly read go to school uh TV watching has sure hasn't gone too much out the door because TV is still well the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular TV programming and watch a lot of other a variety of programs out there as well as use of the VCR uh-huh so that i don't know if it really hampers or it helps our education system i don't know because i know i don't watch while i'm up here at school i don't watch hardly any TV like Thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows but other than that do you watch LA Law no i don't watch that i used to but i don't any more i like that but all i mean there are even though there's a few up here we call them couch potatoes they love to sit in front of the TV i i said but for the for the most part i will i will well i live in an all girls dorm but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twenty one uh-huh and there isn't really a lot of TV watching well that's good at least you're hitting the books right yeah well they're either hitting the books or something else i don't know what but i know oh well i guess they have their crowds like during the soap operas you know like in between classes or something uh-huh but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the TV all day well that's a change then oh of course going to school too it's different from the home environment uh-huh but then um like i know this girl she's doing her student teaching or she's just working like within the school and um yesterday she was at the kindergarten and there's this little boy he like didn't want to do anything and he said i'm not doing this i don't like it and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand and pretend like he's playing Nintendo um you know so uh i don't know how i mean i never really watched that a lot of TV when i was younger but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much TV so i don't know i agree with your parents because uh TV kind of ruined me because that's that's all that we had uh-huh well not really but i mean it's uh for the top medium of entertainment yeah well we watch a lot of i guess we watched a lot of TV in the winter time but in the summer like right now my mom well like she doesn't let us watch TV until like eight o'clock at night you know are like it was even at your age well like my younger brothers and sisters at home like when it starts getting nice outside in the summer and everything she'll she makes us go outside even now when i go home for the summer she makes us go outside and we're allowed to come in and watch TV until it's dark because she doesn't like the TV herself uh-huh uh-huh i see and if it was up to her we wouldn't have one so you know she feels that kids are too dependent on it also uh-huh oh is there anything else um um what about in our work ethics work ethics oh right now it's getting it's maybe getting better i i um a little of course we're we're we're having to weather through the savings and loans and uh-huh all the other scandalous items that well the greed that overwhelmed us in the eighties uh-huh and uh i think i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us um because we have so much to pay for now it's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others yeah including what's left of ours well i really can't think of anything else well it was nice talking to you uh-huh it was nice talking to you too and uh what are majoring in  uh several years ago my very best friend moved to back to Grand Island Nebraska and we had ridden bicycles and it was bothering my knees that spring and we have lots of wind in Indiana and i thought oh shoot i'll just walk to town and i guess that probably started me on a career because i walk a lot in fact it's a part of my life every day i walk at least two miles uh as a side effect i noticed that i was firming up so i thought well gosh maybe if i diet you know this might be work out real well so i ended up losing about thirty five pounds that spring and summer and i had not thought of myself as a fat person and people would say to me gosh i didn't you know well that's great you're really skinny where'd this weight go well evidently i had some weight that i could afford to lose because i'm certainly not skinny now but i guess everything just shook into place so walking uh is very much a part of my life and since my husband's retirement he has also started walking with me and i guess i'd have to say it's a part of both of our lives and we just recommend it to anyone who'll listen to us oh i don't blame you walking is uh you know it's interesting because i think we went through a a phase there where it was jogging everybody should jog you should get out you should jog and then i started hearing about well i'm not able to jog because i'm i have asthma and um well yeah uh-huh uh but i did like to walk and my neighbor and i get out we'd walk and walk and uh unfortunately we haven't done it well i've been in class until it's like seven thirty at night and she having is having a flare up of arthritis and we haven't done it for in about a month uh-huh um-hum now and oh gosh do i notice a difference um-hum well i was at the point where if i hadn't gotten my walk in i was a real grouch that day um-hum and uh a friend gave me this Prevention walking magazine a year ago at Christmas time and they recommend that you only walk five times a week that you do not walk every day but for me the days that i don't i'm not much fun to be around oh neat right well you know now walking relieves a lot of tension and it's a good way to work off vent frustration and things like this i i can't i think sure uh uh it depends on how far you walk how many days a week um-hum you know if you if you're walking ten miles you know seven days a week maybe that uh has some effect but uh i think if you're not walking how many just out of curiosity how many miles do you usually walk at least two uh-huh well you see now that's what i do and um but that that's just about enough and uh uh i mean not that i wouldn't like to walk more but uh um i've um-hum uh-huh i am a widow so uh and i have a handicapped son so i have to really set my priorities of what you know but this is one thing that i do enjoy very much doing um-hum um-hum and uh so but you know i have tried aerobics and i have trouble with that uh ah i jig when they jog yeah i know i i can't i just can't keep and uh the jogging was never for me because my knees are not i just don't think they could stand that so no right well i i have trouble right well i have trouble with one too in fact sometimes if i even just twist wrong my kneecap will pop off so you know um walking seems to be the one and it it really seems to be um-hum um the most beneficial all the way around it gets your circulation going good it uh uh um-hum um it seems to have so many other benefits you know besides just the exercise um uh we're golfers also uh have you done that well uh no my when my husband was living he tried to get he loved to golf he was the avid golfer i used to go with him but only to uh uh um-hum be caddy because um i have a very severe perceptual problem and uh i tried it a few time but uh i can't get you you have to make it down to the hole um yes in in six or seven times you know and when it get more than that and uh so i just yeah it went out for the walk with him and enjoyed you know uh pushing the cart or pulling it or whatever you know but that is that's great my stepfather is seventy four and he goes golfing every day um-hum um-hum um-hum i think that's the beauty of the game that we it's it's a sport that we can participate in as we sink into the sunset so to speak and of course here in Indiana the weather limits us um-hum quite a bit our golf season will start and then stop due to weather and then start we had a right sure last weekend it was just absolutely beautiful and this weekend it's cold and rainy so so we're pretty limited and i guess maybe that might be the one reason that we would be forced into going um-hum right uh south for part of the winter um-hum uh our children live here and our home will always be here but right i know what you mean for better weather we might consider that next winter i'm not well you know it's interesting what they've been what they have what has really caught on here is mall walking yeah oh yes yes yes yes now that has been something i think is really neat the mall actually opens an hour and a half earlier than the stores um-hum um-hum um-hum and it so that people can come in in the winter time and walk and it's so interesting because we made an extended drive as far west as San Diego which i guess is as far west as you can go and down into Texas and then through Colorado on the way home yes and we went to the malls to walk a lot and that's a brotherhood out there those people are you know gosh if Sophie wasn't here today let's go find her and they're really they know who's supposed to be there and what time they're supposed to come and when they're through walking they stopped for coffee and it's it's really neat it's that is neat you know i like that yeah it's really neat i and i even as an outsider passing through town you know after three laps around the exterior of this mall they pretty well know you so it's it's a fun thing to do um-hum that's right yes yes i think so well i i must get back to work nice chatting with you okay it was nice chatting with you bye-bye bye-bye  well there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new Nancy Reagan book out by uh Kitty Kelly the unauthorized biography are you interested in that at all not really i'm not much of a fan of Nancy Reagan so i i don't particularly read um biographies or autobiographies no uh-huh no i haven't read too many i i'm more of a fiction and nonfiction reader that not not of that nature though so uh-huh well i the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to i'm not a fan of Nancy Reagan and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it and i thought just purely for entertainment i might enjoy that but i i wouldn't want to go out and buy it like you know the hard back copy of it yeah but i might check if they if they had it i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though you know i i just you know i'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree you know unless maybe they lived a long long time ago really uh-huh for me it would be interesting to find out what life was that life you know in that period but uh-huh not not really interested no in biographies well i uh i have read some biographies i prefer to read if i read a biography it's mostly because maybe i have to uh you know back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or um preparing some kind of lesson and i need to have um-hum more information about people but i i do like to read some biographies but that one just sounded like gossipy and i wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover but flip through just for just to get a good laugh um-hum yeah i think the last biography that i read i'm not i think it was was um on Lady Randolph Churchill Churchill's mother and that was excellent uh-huh was it uh yeah it was it's in two parts i think the first one is called Jenny or something like that uh because that was her name and um i only got to read one part of it and i've been looking for uh-huh you know the other half but didn't read the i read the half where she was in her later years and it was absolutely excellent and it was very descriptive of of people with money back then and uh affluents in in England uh uh that you know were associated to the king and all and it was um-hum it was really pretty fascinating and i and that was actually a couple of years ago so uh-huh it's it's been a while since i've read any biographies well but i love to read i mean i'm constantly reading i read i like uh mysteries and i like um as far as improving myself uh i haven't read any lately but i was reading classical works that i hadn't read before you know that you might have needed to read in school but that i just didn't read for some reason or another another or that you know that you can only um-hum read so many in school that they make a requirement of and yet there are so many out there right that uh that you you know you never get a chance to read and so i said well i think it was because i read um Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities and i just uh-huh i mean that even when i read it now it still makes me cry the ending of it and i couldn't believe i i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book i'd read some Dickens before but i hadn't read that one and i i was like i thought to myself uh-huh you know what other things are out there that are that are classics you know that have withstood time and that are just excellent something's excellent about them uh-huh whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material they were written you know that was written about and um so i started reading i had this like you know i had a binge of my mother uh i was living in Bermuda at the time with my husband but my uh mother sent me you know like booklet you know uh boxes full of different books oh and uh she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over but she she is quite familiar with i guess because it seems like uh older people have much better um in their schooling they they got more of the classics than i did you know and she knows so much more of them than i do i wouldn't even know you know to go look for that author or that book uh-huh right yeah so well i like the classics too uh i think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books and i well i don't prefer to read a lot of the things like you might find at uh well like at a Target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out paperback type books usually i um-hum i'm going to the book store for a particular reason um uh-hum probably you read a book review or something some kind of review on it yes yes and and uh i buy some of the not self-improvement books but uh self-help books like we just bought a new house so i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for you know and or how to um-hum repair this or repair that in your own home i bought that for my husband and or how to how to do something books you know for reference and uh um-hum and those are really helpful i think in helping um well you know like some what symptoms medical symptoms like when how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not yeah yeah type books which i have use as reference and have been real handy but purely just for enjoyment i i had a major in English and linguistics and so i have have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics and i do enjoy those quite a bit and um so i tend to for reading just day to day uh you know i have a particular book i'm looking for or i just enjoy uh you know the newspaper magazine yeah it's handy well what i do is i usually have two books at one time i have a classic which i have to work on basically you know what uh just depending well some authors i can just you know basically drink in but others i really do have to work at them and then um whether you know they're a foreign author or whatever uh-huh um or if it's their style or or just understanding the material and then i you know it some of those it's like i said it's like school you have to work at it but to me it's worthwhile in the end i feel good about it and i usually remember those a long time later and then i have the books that i read just right purely for enjoyment you know i mean just light reading that i particularly like Dick Francis books and just some of the the authors that are uh for mysteries just you know just light reading uh purely for entertainment you know that's it i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it except to be momentarily pleased you know because i don't i can never remember the plots or anything uh-huh uh-huh right later on those books well i think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things it's not like uh most television where you you know you just you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but still understand what was going on yeah oh yeah that television it gives you everything uh-huh so it's basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your your sight uh your sight but they give you everything else right right it's usually the television that we see nowadays seems like that it's it it doesn't even have some of the underlying uh things to it you know that maybe the old movies and things had you know the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out or you know like with Hitchcock or something where you're you're you're expecting something or um-hum well i i don't know it just i don't really care much for TV at all i just i mean i sometimes get hooked into it but i really i really get mad at myself when i do because i realize i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for T TV no not too much not too much well that's right well i think it is good to to read books and and because even if it's like you say it's light reading you are still getting some mental exercise yeah you're developing your imagination which you know when you develop your imagination that can take you into a lot of other areas because you've developed uh your your your mind in in seeing things you know even if it's your own set way right you know it's you're you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind that's right so i mean that's good and it's it's excellent i i'm we haven't got children yet but i hope to uh set an example for ours that you know that reading is can it can be your best friend basically i mean even if you haven't got a a a human friend around you can pick pick up a book and and uh-huh right and be with somebody basically uh-huh i think so well i guess i'd better close now so i can oh it sounds like your kids are doing stuff so are are you a teacher i gathered you might be a teacher uh well i i was i'm home now full time but uh so yeah we're we think books are important around here well you have a good day stay out of the rain okay bye-bye oh okay uh-huh yeah okay okay you too take care bye bye  well good afternoon to you Mary first let me ask you what's what's the weather like up there to begin with and good well well today uh when i got up it was twenty nine degrees yes and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon but it's been cloudy overcast and threatening rain all day that sounds more like our winter weather down here and we've also had extremely strong winds fifteen to twenty miles an hour for the day well you know i bet that's what we that storm we had last night is that right oh we had a frog strangler go sweeping sweeping through here uh yesterday and last night and we're expecting another one tonight oh really oh i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street we had one of those two days ago uh-huh but not uh but uh no rain at all yesterday and uh no rain today well it's probably on its way up there it was heading north thanks a lot could couldn't you send us some nice weather well it was nice today oh was it uh in between the thunder showers yes well the one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather how some ever we can't do very much to change it well you know what they say about the weather here in Texas what's that if you if you don't like it wait five minutes it'll change oh yes well that's about the way our weather is here also uh-huh what and i grew up in Saint Louis and Saint Louis was much the same uh-huh well tell me uh is is it normally that cold up there in the in the Spring no it's not this is uh about uh ten degrees cooler than usual but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eighty five degrees you're kidding no no it uh it fluctuates from one extreme to the other it seems you are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open i'm sure i didn't i was ready to turn on the air conditioning it no it really was extremely warm it only got down to about sixty five in the evening um-hum we had about three or four days of that and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and uh temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time and uh it has gone down gradually each day this morning it was twenty nine yesterday it was about thirty two uh cars were scraping ice off their cars this morning if they've been sitting out all night it really wasn't too wasn't too pleasant oh mother macree no i should say not well i i sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had oh i hope not i hope it doesn't reach you up there well they are predicting rain and thunderstorms and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had well i let's hope it well it if it's the same as what we had at least it'll be warmer uh yeah yes warm rain well of course by the time it gets up here it may run run into a cold front coming down from Canada yeah oh boy the the that whew that would be tear disastrous if you had that rain storm and freezing weather yes yes oh we had uh a week ago they had golf ball size hail coming down in one part of the uh of the city of Dayton itself uh-huh and uh then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning it it wasn't uh it wasn't conditions to being out in it and i had just gotten home we had a lot of tornado warnings also oh yes and i had gotten home shortly before that uh the rain started so uh i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it uh-huh well uh i heard on the news this morning that um one of our local schools uh lost the roof of their gymnasium is that right and they suspected may have been a tornado uh-huh but uh uh thank God for small favors the uh uh what do they call them the the marching band or something yeah uh uh had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before oh they that was very very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous oh and how well of course this is tornado season uh in to uh we have many tornadoes spawned in this area and northern Indiana now we're in the southwestern part of uh Ohio uh-huh just forty miles north due north of Cincinnati and uh but uh northern Indiana has many tornadoes come roaring across and we get the backlash off of it if not the part of the tornado itself uh-huh so uh we you know we get a lot of bad weather in this area but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion oh yeah well during the winter yes we do uh we've had uh well past four or five years i guess at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain um-hum and uh of course people down here they just don't know how to handle themselves and right yes i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed oh not only that but we're we're either either don't have the equipment to handle it either to uh having to drive in it right right and uh they go out there and the well all you can do with with uh freezing rain of course is spread sand on the ice right and but uh you know we don't even have vehicles that will do that they they have to get uh a truck of sand and uh uh four or five laborers up there just spreading it by hand um-hum right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt and of course the salt does melt the ice but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes uh a perpetual problem well and then to make matters worse it destroys your vehicles too oh it sure does do that yeah they well we they do that down here too they mix the salt in with the sand well sand and uh but i have learned to do is uh now that i am alone is uh to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car um not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight in the back of the car and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that yes uh-huh i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of that but i've no i'm a dog lover myself yeah well the dogs don't use litter but kitty litter is excellent for uh getting under the wheels of cars and what have you and giving you traction uh-huh yeah i guess it would be yeah it uh works out uh really quite well course i have i have a dog also my son brought me a little Lhasa Apso uh for my birthday last Thanksgiving he brought him from Dallas he oh oh wasn't that nice of him yes that uh he just thought i had been without a dog uh for three years that was long enough uh i have uh a a chowperd myself he he had oh a what a chowperd now that one i'm not familiar with well she's part Chow and part shepherd uh okay okay that makes sense then i believe uh-huh but she's the best the best of both breeds yes right well i've always had big dogs before never had a little dog before and well June is medium sized but she is scared to death of thunder storms yes well oh well i had a German short hair that was frightened of storms the minute it would begin to storm he would just panic uh-huh and uh i had to put him down when he was fourteen and two months later i had to put my yellow Lab down because he had leukemia oh and uh then uh then there was no point in having all my acreage i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides oh that must be nice oh well it was great i loved it but then i didn't need all that anymore so i finally sold that and i'm in a fair size condo and i have a nice size patio uh-huh and uh so this little dog has plenty of room to run well good yeah and he is a a cutie and uh but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either and it's no well now you know it sounds like you ought to be in a condo down in Miami Beach somewhere or better yet down around Saint Petersburg Florida is that right uh-huh that's what i call home oh is that right i lived there for ten years oh well i was there once way way back in nineteen sixty i think for just a week's vacation uh-huh but uh i that's about the only time i've been to Florida except passing through on the way to someplace else yep well i lived there in the seventies but uh uh-huh and uh i i love it i have two sons still living down there um-hum well uh uh most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in Florida but uh i have just that's just not been my thing we used to always head west or head north now that i'm alone why uh i uh prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere oh uh-huh and uh course there too you never know what the weather's going to be when you start getting over to well that's that's why i was suggesting uh that Saint Petersburg is got got to be the finest weather in the world oh is that right oh i i loved it down there um course you could tell always tell which were the the natives natives yeah and which ones were the snowbirds oh is that right yeah the snowbirds were the  okay yeah how many times have you called or or participated uh this i'm about my fifteenth call okay i i'm a little less than that i was going to call this week i forgot about it just until i was going to do it tonight uh i have i was i called i think every day last week and i forgot about this week i got so tied up with some other things yeah i got about ten i think yeah well let's see our our topic is uh elections voting uh uh the reason i think the elections are are so low and i'm not sure what they mean by eligible voters are they talking about people that have registered or people that are are old enough to vote but haven't registered oh yeah i'm sure i would think they would talk about people who are already registered and and uh you know the ones that are on the rolls already you know yeah i'm amazed myself sometimes i've got some ideas and they've tried a few things but you first yeah uh well i think one of the reasons uh only fifty percent or so vote in the national is uh well for one thing just just uh having to get to the polls yeah because a lot of people work and not every place will give you time to get off to go to the polls yeah yeah i i'm kind of with you in fact i even think that the there's a conspiracy i wouldn't call it a conspiracy but you know if you really wanted uh you know hundred and hundred million people to vote why would you have voting from seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night for a national election yeah to me you need to have two what's wrong with having two days uh Thursday Friday or three two and a days Thursday Friday and Saturday or something you know where people can vote uh i don't think there's a i don't think there's a lot of politicians want a heavy vote out because uh i can agree in local elections elections which usually are on Saturdays and i'm not too sure that's the best idea i think maybe you should have it you know Friday noon till Saturday so that people who i like do things during the week yeah and i might do it and i i really think that they don't try you know i i really think it's obvious the answers to me is just to have longer you know have at least two days for a national election my goodness yeah and either that or all either have also uh uh second shifts right right because a lot of people work uh you know hours that oh they may have two or three hours there that they could either go before or after work right but uh uh that pushes some people well yeah the seven o'clock in the morning to seven o'clock at night is is usually the average time that most workers go to work you know right and i'm amazed by that that uh the only good thing they've done lately is have these uh uh elections uh what do they call it when you can vote ahead of time uh uh absentee uh absentee and i've done that and actually we've got some high turn outs here in Arlington on some of the absentee because you can vote like two Saturdays before or something like that yeah but i think it's amazing that they they keep complaining about people not voting and and national elections should be more than one day i mean i don't see how you can have tens of or hundreds of thousands of people that you know just can't quite make it on that particular day for one reason or another you know yeah yeah two days to me doesn't seem to be too unrealistic for a national election yeah and as far as local local elections are concerned pardon me i can understand you know why a lot of people don't vote on those because in the first place not many people are are really that knowledgeable knowledgeable about what the uh what the uh candidates are for or against right and uh uh a lot of the uh uh what do you call them not bonds but uh yeah the bonds we had some here in Arlington recently but yeah a lot of the bonds and uh other things that you're voting on people just don't know really what the whole thing's about yeah i i don't really know why you have uh uh you know in a small city or whatever medium size city you have a couple hundred thousand people eligible you know and you get ten thousand to vote i don't have an answer for that i think that uh it is apathy without question uh we are we are not taking it as serious as yeah yeah the people who have lost their rights and everything overseas and everything and i think uh i don't know how to change that plus i always try to vote for those and but i and there are some that if when they have them on Saturday i'll say all right i'm going to work i'm going to go vote this afternoon and then i'll get busy and if no one reminds me then i will forget so i'm not too sure course i guess that's part of being apathy too but i do try to vote in every one but uh yeah i don't i don't have an answer for the local elections and why you have ten percent of the people voting that's really so low i'm amazed plus yeah plus i think a lot of people are just flat disgusted oh that too that too yeah uh uh not realizing the way you change it is to vote yeah but uh but i think in national elections uh again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days you're voting for president yeah uh why is it so sacred to have it on Tuesday and uh why couldn't it be Friday and Saturday i don't know what the ideal day is if you're trying to catch a weekend or maybe just Tuesday and Wednesday i'll bet you'd get a lot more people i think the news media has really they jump in there and they uh tell you the the that who won before seven thirty and before the elections before the polls are closed yeah and i think they jump in way way too early i think that ought to be restricted somehow yeah uh they will not restrict it but they just ought to not release i don't know i don't know what districts are releasing the numbers to these newsmen that they can predict uh i i thought the polls had to be closed before you were allowed why would you release it to the newsmen first i i don't even know how the news media get these numbers from the polls i would think that ought to be sacred and and until it's all over plus also i i'm sure that there's a legitimate reason for it but i don't understand uh personally why you have to register as a Democrat or Republican or whatever and then being being able only to vote in that that race that primary that primary uh yeah i don't i i can see in one way that the right people would try to cancel out votes yeah uh but uh well i think you can say you are an independent too but i don't know uh yeah yeah i haven't thought about that much i i've uh wondered about it but i haven't really got concerned about it one way or another you know yeah uh what that holds back or anything yeah but you're right it it that that is a funny rule at least uh yeah men and women can vote it's amazing that we can still look overseas and see you know this thing in Saudi Arabia and all and they still don't allow women to vote it is still amazing of course we we don't have such a wonderful history that yeah you know we didn't allow Blacks to vote uh and we didn't allow women to vote until i don't even know what the year was for women yeah nineteen nine or something like that when was that yeah so well we're changing at least at least we're trying and and maybe this absentee thing will will take a hold and uh get more people to vote yeah and i'm not i'm not real sure what the well i guess i do what the purpose was i started to say what the purpose of the registration is uh it seems like to me they could use uh either your driver's license or your social security number or something like that because um-hum a lot of people don't vote because they didn't register yeah i don't know why well i think it ultimately i could see why you wouldn't register necessarily when you're eighteen or nineteen because you don't get around to it but i i think that people should register you know after a year or so i don't it's not really that hard uh i haven't thought that people don't vote because they're not registered i really think uh of course that apathy too you don't bother to register yeah uh i am amazed i don't have an answer for why the numbers are so low yeah yeah i think you've got to have a good fight you know you have to have a lot of controversy well i guess it's kind of like watching a ballgame uh or or sports if you're not if you're not interested in the game you wouldn't you don't care whether you see it or not right or if it's close you know you like to see them close you don't like to see someone just totally run away with it and in football in a football game or anything even if you're for one team or the other you always like to see let's have a good game which means you want to see a close game you know oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so if there's no controversy if you're not worried about who's going to win if you think it's going to be a shoo-in then uh you know you don't vote so uh yeah but at at least i guess we're so far ahead of some of the other countries uh that we've still got a better system and and we are we have been doing this for two hundred years so uh uh i guess it's still better that a lot of others yeah i i think usually as a general rule the best man wins most of the time yeah yeah it is surprising how uh uh even with low numbers uh although i was a Goldwater man and he didn't win yeah well i here in Arlington we had this baseball thing and it was a big controversy and everyone was talking about it yet the voting was so low it was unbelievable and they were spending a lot of money yeah you would have thought we would have had close to half of the people in the city voting for this that was going to raise your taxes and it was like twenty five thousand or something like that you know yeah so that part of it is still uh there's something that people for some reason they don't really want to vote uh yeah and maybe maybe absent maybe you ought to be able to do it on your telephone you know i mean i don't know yeah yeah i think uh if they made it a little more convenient they might get more votes yeah yeah and it may come to that you know with the electronic age yeah yeah you put in your code  hi Rick how you doing pretty good you say you live in your own home or you do not no i don't i'm uh renting a townhouse right now but i'm moving uh the end of May i'm going to move into renting a house uh-huh wow i've i've never heard of that before i'm uh well actually this will be the second time i've done it how does i am uh in grad school right now uh-huh and on my kind of salary you just it's kind of hard to come up with money to make a house payment well i i'll bet you end up spending more money renting a house than you would if you put a down payment on it and and uh yeah well down payment is a tough problem i guess yeah if you can get by that hurdle yeah i can remember when i uh when i brought my house i needed help uh and my folks helped me out to get started and now my rent uh well my mortgage if you will is uh cheaper than uh you know one room uh apartments yeah well i don't know you're in Massachusetts i think the the market is a little bit different here it's a lot cheaper in uh in uh Texas oh no i'm in i'm in Raleigh North Carolina oh oh North Carolina yeah uh it's probably what i'm paying now for an apartment is six twenty five uh-huh and this this house we're moving into is only five hundred dollars a month so you'll actually be saving money yeah how about the utilities for the uh for the house that you're in now well the one now is is uh it's got a heat pump um-hum so it's it's kind i mean it's not that cold in Raleigh in the wintertime but i mean the air conditioning is probably your biggest threat um-hum and the new place doesn't have air conditioning and has gas heating so it's going to be i know it's going to be cheaper maybe hotter but i i uh probably make you sick if i told you what my uh my mortgage is with with the taxes yeah i can imagine i know how things are up there i'm paying uh two hundred and thirty dollars a month what with taxes what i bought you have some kind of deal no no deal it when i bought my home uh twenty five years ago it was it was very expensive oh oh twenty five years ago okay yeah that makes yeah i'm an old i'm an old guy well that makes it more my parents have the same kind of deal too they've had their house that long well it works that way with uh with anybody who buys it's very difficult when you first buy your house uh but once but once you do that and hang on to it you'd be surprised what inflation does to uh yeah yeah to the housing market and even though we're in a slump right now it's not going to last forever it's going to catch up sooner or later and uh you got you got to live in a house some day uh yeah yeah see the problem i have now is uh i i want mobile because i'm not really sure what is going to happen a year from now i've moved like um-hum three times in the last two years when you rent the home do they uh force you to lease and guarantee payment uh yeah they usually do put a a year lease on it um-hum i was living in Colorado and i didn't have a lease which was really nice oh the the lease but i just kind of a verbal agreement yeah i'm going to stay a year and i'll be nice to you if you'll be nice to me yeah the the lease can work uh work two ways it can work to your benefit too where uh they can't increase your your rent uh if something goes wrong with with a written lease but with an oral lease they can so it works both ways yeah yeah yeah huh well what would you suggest think it would be a good idea even i think i might be moving to buy a house well buying a house is is should be your ultimate goal because you're going to have to live somewhere yeah and uh even if uh if you hang on to it for five years put a little bit of uh uh money into it you're going to get it back again with uh with premium just like putting money in a bank it's forced forced savings yeah if uh yeah you know living in a house is something you're going to have to do whether you you're doing it alone whether you're doing it with a with a a partner or you're going to have to you know yeah yeah see i'm single now and and see i may be going back and getting a PhD um-hum and i know i can't afford a house if i'm going to be doing that you you sound like a young guy and and uh yeah i'm i'm twenty five all right when i was uh in my early twenty twenty one twenty two years old i was working for a a guy in a gas station yeah and he tried to convince me to buy this single family house that he saw for sale and uh hum uh the price will sound odd because it was uh you know about thirty years ago but it they wanted uh forty nine hundred dollars for it wow and the buying a house was the last thing that i wanted to do yeah so i didn't buy it and i'm sorry now because I i you know i wasted a lot of money uh when you're twenty twenty one twenty two years old you you throw it away you and i wasn't paying rent i was living at home you wish you did paying it on rent oh well that's the ideal thing but uh but you know i was throwing my money away with that on girls cars you know typical things yeah yeah i had to waste a lot of money on my car that was the biggest mistake i ever bought you buy a car it depreciates you buy a home and it inpreciates it it it i know it was the s tupidest thing i why didn't someone tell me that you you buy a car uh and have it a week and you've lost half of it already i know i bought a a brand new i bought a Jeep with everything on it um-hum and it was just i don't know big mistake i don't even use it i rode my bike to class so there i live uh i live in a a ranch um-hum uh five rooms upstairs one uh room downstairs a basement full cellar um-hum uh i i've been painting it white only because uh that's the way it was when i bought it it's a white with black shutters on it hum uh uh i've got a garage under the house so where where are you near uh Boston outside of Boston yeah i'm about thirty five miles south of Boston oh are you are you near uh i have relatives in-laws that live there uh-huh where about what is it Duxbury uh that's still a good hour ride i guess north or south of you i'm south they're north of me okay so you're like at the bottom of Cape Cod no i'm not in Cape Cod i'm uh oh about a you know five minute ride from Rhode Island oh okay way down there i see i see i was i was up there Christmas my sister got married in Duxbury and the housing market up here is uh is really slumped so you can buy a houses relatively inexpensive right now huh Raleigh well uh have you ever do you read uh US News no i don't Raleigh was in the top twenty five housing market i mean it was a good place to buy a house but the problem is that the average house cost is really high what about the tax structure it's i mean it's it's good to buy a house if you have the money it's just that the houses are like um-hum two hundred to three hundred thousand dollar houses wow what is the tax structure like up there how much a thousand i'm i'm not really sure to tell you the truth as my uh being a renter not even caring about that you don't care about that huh no my uh my taxes exceed my mortgage payment wow it wasn't like that when i first that's like my car where the insurance is almost you go to the yeah i can imagine it wasn't like that when i first bought my house uh this gentleman that i was talking to when i did buy my house told me that's what happened to him hum and uh this was you know thirty years ago and it's happening to me my tax is exceeding my mortgage payment yeah i'm paying a hundred and twenty one dollars a month uh i've got another uh year to pay on my house hum and my my uh taxes are a hundred and thirty five wow that that just doesn't seem to make make any sense why if you have to tax something for something you already own yeah but they're going to tax you just like they tax you your automobile they're going to tax your home yeah yeah and then you've got maintenance expenses but the overall cost is is a a lot cheaper now and where you're single now's the time to do it when you're married you know got to have time you're not going to have money you're not going to have yeah well i did see a house for sale in the area i wanted to move into but i don't know where i could come up with the down payment what is what the what is the down payments look like now twenty five percent i don't know i don't know you didn't even didn't even look huh i didn't even look uh see i'm living with two other people so when i when we break five hundred dollars in in three ways oh it isn't bad yeah it's not bad at all you're living with three other people no two other people two that's still tough yeah i can't even live with one well i don't know i still like being a student i guess yeah well it's it's nice to get somebody to help you with the rent and everything but uh at the end of ten years what are you going to have um-hum nothing what are you majoring in school i'm in computer science actually i'm uh today i had uh i'm in a Masters program oh yeah and today was my thesis defense and i passed wow oh i see so we're getting ready for a big party as you can imagine so you're graduating this year yeah i'm going to graduate this semester so actually i'm going into the uh job market uh-huh what i really want to do is pay off my car and then lots of lots of lots of luck on the job market yeah although the computer uh science areas are booming right now but the uh yeah the thing that's holding everything back right now is the economy yeah i i really didn't have any problem i mean i had companies knocking on my door i didn't even like interview they came looking for me no kidding now that's good yeah they're they're always looking for a lot of uh good computer people because there's a lot of equipment out there and no one knows how to run it yeah yeah i i run a little uh computer business at at my home at night oh really yeah i'm working with uh Texas Instruments home computer okay and i do repair work sell software and hardware hum uh we're supposed to be talking about houses though right well i run the business in my home out of your out of your house yeah that's great so what kind of a house do you expect to buy when you do buy uh something on a lake all right um-hum or on a body of water this is the ideal house right yeah right big garage a big basement just like my parents house except for on the water huh well maybe some day you'll own your parents' homes that's true because i think they're going to move to Arizona when they get old my dad is into hot air ballooning and that's like balloon heaven is Arizona wow so it doesn't sound like he's ready to retire yet no well he retired from one job and then took another one you know took that early retirement deal now has two salaries wow do you do ballooning too uh i've crewed for him some oh but uh i've never never gone up in a balloon he's the pilot excuse me  the uh public school system system seems to be getting a lot of uh criticism lately i guess over the years it's always seemed worse uh to the parents that have kids in there than it was when they were there so uh i don't know how much of it is well a lot of it is deserved but then a lot of it's not i mean the the kids are coming out learning uh things a lot faster uh whether or not they actually have it learned that that that yet uh remains to be seen at least in our kids case it's they're still in it but uh i know they're learning things that uh um-hum we never learned plus they have the burden of uh well this is the burden they have the task of learning computers uh even in uh kindergarten they had uh a requirements that they had to meet for learning the uh terms like keyboard and monitor and they wanted know what a computer was and what a disk was and oh really that's great you know all the uh yeah it is but it's interesting that that there's that much more knowledge to be learned at this at this uh age you know not just the colors and begin on the alphabet it's so much more complex yeah learn your colors learn your alphabet learn all your your little terms here and and learn how to uh begin learning some of the reading and by the second or third grade uh the little school system that we're in they have uh really a lot of computers uh it's a very wealthy district as as all that fighting's going on over who gets the money and the like but they have great yeah i've been hearing about that they have uh twenty seven computers for each of the little labs and each lab serves uh two grades so the first and second graders have their own batch of computers that they've cycled the kids through and goodness and so there's uh well i guess three or four different labs and they're all very nice uh computers all tied together on the LAN and one server that handles all the software so that the teachers don't have to go around to each machine and do their work they can control it from the machine the server it's it's a beautiful system but uh the only bad thing it seems to do is uh not the computer necessarily but the company the school system seems to put a little bit more pressure on the kids than uh than we had of course of course i guess with that learning comes that pressure um-hum we also managed to land in a school that uh they decided to build one big rectangular building and then not have any walls for the classroom and so it gets a little noisy it's a little hard to keep the kids that quiet from one class to the next and they can't really oh be rowdy at any one given time so they they put them outside a lot they try you know to get a lot of good breaks here and there and but uh they just took bookcases and things to move around and sort of what you know sort of build a an idea of a wall and the kids seem to handle it okay but it's it's got some drawbacks to it and uh as if that wasn't bad enough they they also experimented with a particular size school most of the elementary schools were uh seven hundred uh kids in in it only goes from kindergarten up to fifth grade for our elementaries and our particular schools run uh thousand fifty right now oh goodness so they they put a few more warm bodies in there than the teachers really needed to have they still have a twenty three to twenty five or so to one teacher ratio but it's still that can be a disadvantage to the kids yeah still a lot of people and you just can't get them in and out of the school in a reasonable length of time you know traffic is a bit of a problem i mean of all the decisions they could have made on this particular school they uh they located it in a up against a creek and there's no street access to it except for one turn around driveway and that feeds onto a street that is right across the street from oh no another school and they all get out at the same time and it's just uh so we we spend a little time getting i get get it go over there to pick up uh my son about two thirty and he gets out at two forty five and that gives me a little bit of time to get parked and then i wait for between between kids rather than drive all the way home i wait a little while and and at two thirty i mean at three thirty my daughter gets out and we usually let them play if the weather's nice play outside until the traffic dies down and then we go home so i'm there from two thirty until four o'clock i'm just waiting for oh that's a good idea to pick up the kids that's how much of a chunk it takes out of the old day but uh it is better just to let them you know play outside than it is to fight the traffic so and there's it's real nice park lands on both sides of the school they have you know climbers and stuff like that but well great the the school system in and of itself as far as what they're teaching um they cannot keep up with the private as far as because of the ratio there's just no way plus the private tends to have um-hum the more disciplined kids you know they're not dealing with the whole gamut of personalities here they're they're private schools do not put up with a child that is uh that much of a problem like most schools have to that's right so you have that kind of a situation but uh by the same token you have kids coming out of private schools that they've spent very much time with them not able to social cope socially with the other types of people in the world yeah um i remember i mean during my i went to a private school during the junior junior high years which was uh you know really during the development development time of my life and it was a small school we had like maybe twenty people in junior high i mean in my class like in seventh grade we had twenty in them and whenever we moved up to the eighth eighth grade we had like twenty or twenty five in the whole eighth grade and we had two different classes so the ratio was real good um as far as the we had real good teachers and i learned a lot i feel like that if i had of gone to a private school during junior high i probably wouldn't have developed such good study skills because um i thought the private school was difficult i mean it gave a lot of homework and everything and it really helped me develop my skills my uh my memorization i can memorize things real well now and things like that but and then whenever i got to high school it was kind of a disadvantage to me to to the fact that i was going from a class of twenty to a class of five hundred and uh and i do feel like that i was socially withdrawn to a certain extent because i didn't know anyone uh-huh and i was a freshman in high school you know and i was the peon but uh it probably took i don't know maybe the first semester to get to get to where i was really comfortable with school because um i hadn't been in the public school system for so long and it is just it's really different it uh the children there are a lot a lot wilder than what i was used to i was grew i grew up in a very protective home and then whenever i got to high school things were just so much different especially nowadays i mean even the high school that i went to just recently they put up these little metal detectors at each door when you walk in to make sure you don't have a gun and things like that and uh uh-huh i mean it's it's gotten worse i graduated about two years ago and even in the past two years it's gotten i mean it's just increased the the crime and the the drugs and the violence and everything have just crime increased enormously uh-huh so um well another thing that we've noticed that's uh changed over the years and uh we're not really sure exactly what we're going what we want to do with it publicly but uh the teachings uh the ideas that are taught uh don't always agree with what we would teach them either from a standpoint of morals or from a standpoint of how to handle a given situation um-hum and there seems to be a a large degree of violence not necessarily taught but but ingrained in a majority of the kids either from TV or from uh quite a few kids like in the second to third grade take uh karate lessons and take various uh self-defense things and it's it's it's given to them or it's proposed golly it seems to be socially acceptable as a self-esteem you know building building the person's confidence up and you have um-hum uh third and fourth graders that are uh you know when they get into a fight they they tend to use some of the the maneuvers that they have and they feel a little more confident about their fighting ability they tend to get into a few more fights and several of them have ended with uh police calls and and having uh broken bones down at that level of oh goodness of kids i know more than one kid that has has got a uh record already just because of fighting of that that nature oh no and it's it's not something that necessarily happens at school but just in their their uh relationships as they after school times and the like um-hum and then you get into the whole area of of uh well what what i would deem the new age thinking where they have these little extra classes but they offer to come in about fifteen to twenty minutes early in the mornings and all the kids will sit around in a little circle and they're they're asked to empty their minds and to to think about uh they have a name of a particular dinosaur that they they're to uh think about that dinosaur and they're encouraged  okay do you go camping very much no i've haven't gone camping in years but it's something that i've done in the past how about you uh we try to go once maybe twice a summer uh well that that's pretty avid to me we uh just you know for like a short weekend or something we don't go for the long you know week long thing uh-hum but uh we usually go to uh a lake area you know where the campsites are and do that uh right do you tent camp or do you have a camper oh no no no a tent that's what i i you know that's how i camp too that's how i define camping the rest of the rest of that is really really not the same as a matter of fact my my my me me too you're really roughing it yeah you know the majority of the amount of camping i've done has been really roughing it um as a little girl i'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother and we went to the Boundary Waters area in Minnesota so oh that's that's really wild yeah are you here in local Texas i mean yes i'm in Austin where are you i'm in Garland oh right outside of Dallas so we um we have a five year old and we started taking her she was pretty young when we started uh camping with her uh-huh oh the kids love they they just love it it's wonderful for them to be outside i know i know i know and then they and they you know there's no TV and they don't have all these modern toys and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like that to play with exactly yes and i like that it's pretty fun well how it really is a good a good family thing to do yeah and um-hum yeah we we try to uh go with another couple that have children also and uh that makes it a lot more enjoyable plus you know we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff you know we kind of split it up uh um-hum good planning yeah because it gets it really does get expensive if you if if you don't want to rough it all the way exactly you know even with sleeping bags those are running you know good thirty dollars a pop and so we've built that up but no want one bad do you you're right you're right do you have a boat no oh i well actually i would you know what i would love i would absolutely love a sail boat that doesn't go along with camping but now that that that's what i would like to have oh yeah yes i would too yeah would too we usually uh like i said we try to go to a lake my husband and this uh other couple that we go with her husband um they like to um is it scuba dive and so we'll go to a lake and uh where they can go do that we're close enough so they can do that and the girls can play on the beach area okay um-hum and i wanna play on the beach area too that's what i would do you know i'm just sitting here listening listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer's going to have with that yes yes that's fun really am i pretty Texan you're pretty Texan yes but you know you know what's really funny um i've had people tell me that i have a Texas accent and i mean there just is no way i've not picked one up no you don't you don't sound like it to me i've only lived here about six years so if if if i have one it must be very very slight but the Yankees can hear it yes yes oh well that's true that's true i see i don't think i do but um but a lot of people do say i sound like i guess i have i guess more of a twang to my voice but sure am i've lived here all my life but anyway uh um-hum are you a a native Texan oh well good for you have you ever been to Austin yes yes we went last summer actually there how was i'm wondering i'm really not that familiar i know there're some good places to go camping along the uh the lakes oh is there okay well we didn't go camping we just uh we did like um we drove down to Houston to visit friends and went went to Galveston and uh to San Antonio and then up to Austin and and kind of uh you know doing the sight seeing type um-hum stuff so we didn't go camping that would be fun though to go that's one thing my husband wanted to do was on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went and i said well i'd love that but it takes a lot more planning it does and and ever once you know on my summer vacation you know my week long vacation i want to be a little bit pampered you know by a hotel or whatever um-hum right exactly exactly yeah so we're hoping to do like a three day weekend there's um a thing called Pfeiffer Rim i don't know if you've ever heard of it no i haven't it's uh there's a town called Glenrose i think it's around two hours from here and uh it's got it has like dinosaur tracks oh that sounds and stuff like that and it's got one of those wildlife parks that sounds great yeah i think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there and have you ever camped out of state no i haven't you know where you should try sometime is Colorado it is beautiful absolutely beautiful where is it i've just been up there skiing and well we've driven through you know but but not you know camping or anything but i would love to camp in the mountains um-hum um-hum yeah Estes State Park is fantastic that's what my girlfriend says yes she loves that place she loves that she says that's where we need to go sometime well see you need to go there it is it's you know it's it's high canyon and uh and there's this little mountain lakes and it's very peaceful and um in in the early fall time um oh um-hum i can't remember what type of trees they are but they all the leaves turn yellow and it's just brilliant and yes you would you'd like it very much i know you would oh i love that that's neat that's neat well i used to go camping all the time as a a Girl Scout i was too all the time i got real used to it then i felt like we roughed it then yeah uh well we did well we did you know we really did i mean i just don't understand these people that think taking an RV and parking it and sitting inside and watching TV and having your microwave it's not camping right yes exactly i mean we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything exactly right right i mean that is it you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff to really be camping yeah well do you you haven't say you haven't been in years right oh no i haven't i'm um i'm a struggling single mom and um yeah thank you um it's you know time is precious money's precious um and oh gosh bless your heart yes it it it it i just haven't haven't been able to do it and you know what that was one of the things i really thought i'd like to do with my children you know again and the i'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women you know i i uh-huh uh-huh i don't blame you i don't blame you at all years ago it would have been fine but yeah and i i really now now now i i have gone on one little vacation just the girls and i we drove down to Port Aransas and rented a little efficiency you know and and had a marvelous like two nights and oh yeah yeah that was great and even at that it it was like the first time that i ventured you know out of the city by myself and and you know i i stayed in a nice place but it's still it's real different not to have another adult with you um-hum yes i know i can imagine no i don't blame you not nowadays you know i'm just a chicken i know lots of women would do it all the time but i haven't i haven't quite adjusted you know yeah now are you with TI down there well i i was with TI until January i uh i left TI in January hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money good so well it it was a it it was a good plan but i haven't yet i got into sales and i'm selling um telephone systems have you okay oh oh that's neat and it's it's fun and it's interesting but it also um pretty challenging and i haven't i haven't started making money yet hum it's hard isn't it so yeah it's it's hard so now how old are your girls eleven and fourteen oh goodness they're yeah so i'm old oh oh you're not old you're not old at all well excuse me just second honey i'll be with yeah go ahead sure there's some one at the door so well i'm i'm going to listen we always oh okay do you need to go check and see if we should answer the door at night so yeah so well i've enjoyed this and uh yeah well that's very smart yeah me too and good luck how many have you made so far calls i i haven't made any i've been just a recipient oh have you oh well this is only about my second one i've ever made i've been a recipient on the others how many have you had so far do you know i think i've had about four yeah yeah yeah it's well you know when i had to set huh this is my my Gemini nature you know it's like what are you interested in and it's like virtually anything i'll talk about anything with anybody four that's good very good yes yeah i don't and it's it's been real interesting the different personalities that i that i run across you bet you bet i know yes i always try to find out where they're from you know because it because it is neat neat it really is well then i guess i'll let you go so you can go get the door and exactly um-hum um-hum well thank you and um i enjoyed talking with you you have a good time camping when you go next time think of me all right bye-bye you me too thank you okay thank you bye-bye  hello hello i was i was thinking about our topic for the night um immigration problems we have immigration problems and what do do you think about it well i think it's a very very complicated and i sort of i see perspectives on all sides uh and i've really have no hope for solutions but um i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue i have worked with uh uh a little bit with refugees from Southeast Asia uh who've come over um you know to escape the genocide programs that are over there and seen you know heard about some of the problems that they've had and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be because i in general like a smaller rather than a larger population to the land area and um um-hum um-hum where are you i'm in California which has a lot of immigration probably more than any where else in the country though i'm not sure if that's the case well we've got a lot too i'm in Texas in Garland right outside of Dallas uh-huh yeah um-hum um-hum so we're getting a large oh gosh i don't know i think there's like twenty six different languages now that are spoken in i the DISD Dallas Inner City School District um-hum um-hum Cambodians uh Asians Vietnamese we we're getting a lot of um Mexican Americans you know we've had those for a long time yeah sure well Texas used to be part of Mexico or most of it yes oh yes no i'm busy right now Steven Steven wants me to do popcorn right now okay and i don't know what the solution is i i don't either it's a really delicate uh moral issue because if if you have well i guess the one thing i do see that is is that needs to be a solution is that if you do let people into the country i do feel you have a certain obligation to get them on their to to get them on their feet because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in and you're you're dooming them to being underclass people yeah right you know you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever and i know that that the Southeast Asians the Hmong people that i've done some work with uh feel really quite hurt and and unsure of themselves when here because they're coming from you know from the slash and burn intercultural society you know they're coming from the middle ages basically and they're being plunked down in plunked down into America many of them had been promised by the CIA during the war over there that because they cooperated with the CIA and they helped the CIA out that when they came here the CIA would help establish them in America and the CIA of course isn't doing that and uh hum so they come here and they don't know what what the heck they're doing and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities and of course there are people in the big cities who would do like nothing better than to take advantage of them uh-huh and they're they're incredible victims of crime and part of it is this lack of lack of basic information being dissimilated and i'm not saying it's easy to do and i know there are a few people who are trying but but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on and there's a lot of graft like people trying to tell them oh giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it uh yeah exactly yeah have i mean these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what America's like um and it's very it's i yeah right i couldn't really conceptualize how hard it was to understand that until i until i met with them and i realized that they some of the information that i just you know don't even realize and know is information they don't have and i never thought well i guess that is something you need to know you know people getting into trouble because they come here and so they start farming on uh available land you know like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it but then someone comes along and says you can't do that you know why can't they they have no idea why not some some of them you know the ones that have been here longer and have been in you know understand now but when they initially come over you mean really trying to plant something that's what you're saying farming yeah because they're farmers these are all farmers coming over and they're being put in the middle of the city ah oh oh that's terrible i mean they're nomadic farmers you know they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside uh-huh these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before you know these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war and uh they have you know so i i i do have a lot of sympathy for them and i feel that America could try a little bit harder to to help people adjusting to the American way because if they don't you're just going to produce you know you're going to produce an underclass you know you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks being sort of led out of slavery and then then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then and there was no real up upward movement and not being yeah um and not being cared for yeah that's true well what did you do when you helped these people how did you what did you do through well i i wasn't helping them i worked with them not to help them but actually for my own purposes i'm i'm a linguist and i was uh doing a language trying to learn their language a little bit and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that oh i uh-huh uh-huh i do have friends who have tried to do more social work you know by explaining to people how the language and what the problems learning English might be and such because all the models of teaching English are based on teaching English to Spanish speakers or to other European language speakers and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are well i'm an ESL teacher yes i got my certification but actually they did not teach us very many things oh you are uh-huh well you about how really to go about helping people to learn another language i mean it's like people don't know what to say it's not step to step that's that's been my impression yeah it's it's not they're not withholding information they just don't have that information they they haven't the foggiest idea yeah but anyway i enjoy it they the kids i've worked with so far have been Spanish speaking yes and but i'm applying for what yeah it is a lot of the words are the same or you know they just change the pronunciation a little bit but i love it i love the culture the that they way they respect education and Spanish is pretty close to English really and Spanish is a lot like English yeah yeah yeah and their teachers and um-hum um-hum their parents so much more than than my children do you know and um-hum um-hum i like it and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this uh Asian center that a Doctor Falk has started that works with the school district and doing what um-hum um-hum trying to get them set and inculturated um-hum um-hum um-hum into the system i thought that would be good experience for me and i've applied at another district where many of the children are Asian oh i'm sure it would um-hum um-hum and i think that would be wonderful too yeah it would be a good experience and you'd be helping people i'm sure very much and and i i mean not to put not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the Asian groups are having a lot of trouble i mean and part of the problem is that a lot of Chinese and Japanese immigration from you know decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth they became a very successful immigrant group right but and but a lot of people coming over from Vietnam right now coming from war torn countries are are not not having the same success i think some people have just assumed well why why can't you be successful the Japanese were or the Chinese were or something And it's really much more complicated well and times were different too yeah the times are different yeah my neighbor let's see is Jewish and he's going through the i don't know Jewish League or something and helping a family that's come over from Russia um-hum um-hum um-hum and he spends well right now he's down to like once a week but he was going over there several times a week to meet with the family and help them with the language and he thoroughly enjoyed it um-hum um-hum oh yeah i i think it's a wonderful thing to do and there's a lot there's a lot more i guess another possible solution is since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it no uh more of the volunteer network service because everyone gains from it um-hum would be would might be really useful um and if it's you know uh just people helping people i think makes makes the community so much happier uh-huh what's so sad about this is both of the the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers but their training isn't what we need in this country and because they're so deficient in English they haven't been able to get jobs um-hum yes um-hum um-hum so they'll have to go back and get a degree here you know almost start all over yes yes i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country i mean and they're highly educated people but of course if you're educated and you don't speak English no one thinks anything of you no no and this woman was um stocking the shelves in a drugstore um-hum um-hum feel sorry for her yeah i do too well it's been good talking with you well same here have a good night okay yes i do okay bye uh okay okay it does sound like you have some children to take care of uh okay bye-bye  so do you fish oh yeah my dad has a lake cabin and so we go there for the small lake uh just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area it takes us about three hours to get there and we go and we fish and we catch a bunch of junk nothing nothing to talk about for the most part but it's fun uh from a boat or from shore from the dock from shore oh that's nice uh mostly catfish or oh mostly we catch carp if we're doing good we catch a catfish or two once in a while and you know we go ahead and eat those but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry what we normally do is just uh go ahead and clean it up and then uh you know put it in a bag and freeze it and and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd usually there's a pretty good crowd there so we don't ever catch enough to eat carp is usually pretty much fun because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on a little you know a little pole with twenty pound test line and that that's a pretty good fight so that's a lot of fun yeah a real light line real light rig well that sounds like fun yeah they fight hard fish in Colorado so different than that mostly trout yeah in the mountains yeah and in the rivers and stuff yeah yeah mountain streams and rivers are they good to eat uh yeah very yeah there isn't much there you know oh you mean size wise they're not very big um by and large no but but they're big fun yeah well i've been is that mostly uh fly fishing when you're doing that or are you fly fishing or are you using a bobber what i i i'm a fly fisherman yeah yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun i've never even tried that my if i don't have a reel with a button on it i tend to get so much backlash it's not worth the trouble well let me explain fly fly fishing to you then you're not casting a weight on the end of the line uh-huh you're casting the weight of the line with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight yeah well the fly on the end weighs nothing it weighs less than the line oh so what you do is you strip off oh four five six little rolls coils of line into your hand uh-huh and you whip the line hum as you whip it over your head or side to side uh-huh you slowly feed out more and more hum so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some well no no you fish upstream oh you fish upstream right and then you let it carry it downstream uh-huh and then you reel it in and you do it again you hope that they think it's a bug and yeah exactly jump at it and eat it yeah uh from what i'm seeing and hearing and all the the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern that's a fish no no it it looks like a grub yeah okay whenever you yeah a lure a fly oh it's a it's a lure i see whenever you have a something that looks like something else uh-huh and it's a fly you call it a pattern oh all right uh you know there's bumble bee patterns uh-huh there's excuse me uh there's bumble patterns there's mosquito patterns there's wasp patterns there's grub patterns uh um did someone just come up with this design and and you're going to make one for yourself or are you going to buy it uh you can buy them uh i've got some and uh-huh they seemed to have been hitting real heavy on it in Fall oh it's just that that just happens to be what the fish like this year huh yeah yeah you know how that changes um the phase of the moon and i guess so we tend to use just bait and a few lures but bait tends to work the best just some blood bait yeah yeah i i yeah i'm from west Texas oh are you where are you from oh i'm from Midland yeah Lubbock oh another west Texan i went to college at Tech so you've been out to Buffalo Gap fishing yeah yeah yeah i've been up there it i didn't catch anything but i've been up there it it's kind of nice way to get away from everything for the day yeah it's fun it's lazy take a picnic lunch i used to do that with my dad every once in a while we'd go out on a Saturday and just spend the day before it got too hot yeah it's well there you fish mornings and evenings yeah yeah we do most of our fishing at night and nights yeah just from the heat of it all that's one advantage you've certainly got on us it at times gets incredibly hot here it does i've only been up there once in the summer well no i've been up there twice in the summer but both times it was really pleasant in fact it snowed on us in in gosh when was that we were in Mesa Verde Park and it was like the end of June it was just before July fourth June oh and it was twenty eight twenty nine degrees we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags not knowing any better and here it went and it froze and it snowed on us we did not know what to do about it yeah fishing is not just just dragging fish out of the water it's it's a total experience you know getting out in nature and yeah hearing the crickets and listening to the birds and seeing the squirrels and camping out and eating out of doors and uh-huh do you yeah do you have to do you wear waders when you fish uh i probably ought to i just freeze oh goodness it must be a little bit cold yeah yeah well you know ankle deep or standing on the bank and slipping it out there that's cold water around there slipping it out there um you know i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it out there and do you have any oh i see you know how it is the water's kind of yeah and you get you get a little more carried away with it and you move a little closer and then you're in to it just a little bit and then you splash in and the next thing you know your knees are wet yeah do you have any kids that you take fishing uh got a stepdaughter she's real sweet and uh uh-huh at times she enjoys it at times not and yeah a fuzzy little dog i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old and the little one of course is could care less the uh three and a half year old has just gotten to the point we got him a little pole last year and just put uh ah yeah yeah his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up that was what he considered fishing this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond we were out at their farm and and they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we walked we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish and he started trying to cast it yeah yeah so he he was kind of getting there but he's yeah you guys sure want to be out of range he's at a dangerous point right now he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in it takes time yeah last year we had a oh just a wonderful trip up to Trappers Lake oh it was cold and rain the whole time and yeah we still had a good time out of the deal yeah well that's good uh and Colorado is a beautiful place to live oh yeah my husband would like to live there but i don't know all of our family is here so well and you've got to have you've got to work for a living to well yeah but TI is up there so that part of it would probably work out what division y'all in i'm sorry what what division are y'all in we're both uh i was uh military but he's division three it goes back and forth Division well maybe division one right now he's in computers oh so and he's in school and everything else i have some friends who work up there well the only thing up here is division one oh yeah Kathy and Kevin Guy okay yeah yeah and they like to fish they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer her dad has a cabin and they go fishing up there oh fishing's fishing is fun up here it's not so that would be neat to try it some time it seems like the success ratio the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there but it is fun you know it yeah long as you have a good time that's the main point so the the experience is is better up here i think you know it seems more relaxing there's more to look at uh-huh definitely more to look at and and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul yeah you know if you're if you're just sitting on a nice hot lake yeah the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up we camped next to one one time when we were there a couple of summers ago and we figured we were up a long way off and then it rained that night and we thought well wonder how far off we are and we got up the next day and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away and it's like oh well maybe we ought to move just a touch so that was kind of funny yeah it it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden yeah i just love the way it looks i could almost just watch the water we in fact we have gotten out on on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much and if you were there i mean it was one time we were there and i guess it was late May so it was really your spring almost you know at even though it was it was really summer down here and and the i guess the creek the mountains were really starting to melt and the creek was just wild just running uh-huh and and all the white water and noise and the it was just beautiful yeah it it gets foamy foamy almost and you know it's just pure and pristine uh-huh yeah and the froth and  go ahead oh um uh i usually don't get to hear hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news uh-huh uh you know being uh i mean by the time you get off work go by and pick up the uh baby from the baby sitter it's you know after six and by the time everything is settled in it's ten o'clock before i can catch up on anything yeah i guess that's the way i am too i sometimes i hear some things on on the radio uh-huh oh yeah i only get the newspaper on the weekends so oh uh-huh oh i don't even have get time to read the newspaper except in passing uh-huh you know i'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on but uh i i guess occasionally i'll hear someone at work say something though yeah we have uh a news thing on the computer that uh i'll i'll try to look at every day uh-huh and uh it it's pretty much headline news yeah which isn't you know pretty much what we look look for anyway uh-huh but uh i do you think that the quality of the uh the you know the news events that you get are what do you think about it well i i guess it's pretty good and and like the Dallas area and i get i uh-huh i guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this or i guess a lot of pressure in that business to yeah well you know there's a lot of competition in the media borderline at that uh-huh and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines and that they'll run a topic into the ground yeah and uh you know they try to play public's opinion which i think is awful because it usually works uh-huh true i'll bet that was the case of the the war in the Middle East yes uh-huh that uh lots lots of new uh newsmen were created during that so it will be interesting to see what happens uh-huh it's true trying to think what else is is current right uh uh well um i don't know what to say uh that's a bad one they uh looks like we're going to have an income tax in Texas yeah i hate to see that but it's uh that that you know if what it's going to take well you know we can deduct that from our income tax our federal income tax uh-huh but uh you know but we need good schools uh we're more involved in that now and i i i i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools yeah that's true so i would think they could find a better way to fund it though but they haven't for no you know i wish they could have gotten a lottery well they're struggling with it yeah i think you know the lottery could have helped so i mean it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax i mean probably would have paid the same amount but you know it's not the idea of your paying uh income tax uh-huh true so i i'm not sure there's a positive solution for that no it'll be interesting to see what happens trying to think what else is current i you know i haven't seen the news in a couple of days so it uh i'm a little behind on things well the other thing i can think of is uh what is still going on in Iraq yes that's that's sad and the Kurd refugees yeah they uh yeah they had to choose between the better of the two two bad situations and uh-huh uh i don't know what i've would have done in the situation yeah it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and yeah finish the job while we were in there right but i understand why Bush you know doesn't want to go in and and uh take sides i mean because that would definitely look like another Korea uh-huh and he'd have all these people jumping down his back even though i'd agree with it i think he ought to should've gone in there and blew them away seems to have helped him though popularity wise yeah it it it did a lot he did a real good job i believe i have uh in-laws that live in Saudi Arabia that stayed there during all of it too hm it uh you know we so we kept very much abreast of what was going on yeah were were they in any of the areas where they some of the Scuds yeah they were on the the near near uh Dahran on the um um-hum on the west east coast yeah they were just north of it probably about a hundred fifty miles hundred miles from uh the Kuwaiti border uh and they stayed active was the uh the military there taking supplies out to them in the desert uh-huh it was it was a new situation yeah i'll bet i don't really have much more to say i don't know anything else that's current other than the weather you're right and that's that's awful in Texas and have have you all been getting rain storms down there we got some awful rain uh the other morning and today's just been real drizzly we did we did last night uh some real massive thunderstorms yeah apparently i i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too uh-huh caused some damage it did we may get some more tonight oh well we we've just got slight chances of rain but uh oh well we we've just got slight chances of rain but uh we had the we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning course while everybody was getting ready to go to work uh-huh making nice traffic jams well the the ground here is so flat and it's all saturated now we're getting some flooding right uh when was it last week we had all the rain but uh we i think we had about eight inches hm it was between six and eight inches here where we are goodness and uh it you walk out on the ground i mean you i mean it's awful it's just so soggy yeah it's a lot more humid down that way yeah in fact miserable well today it was i mean the air was just so sticky so damp yeah i think there were places around downtown Fort Worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time like an hour or so just goodness a bunch well i guess that's it that's about as much as we can do with current events right well it was right well it was nice talking to you good talking to you Michelle all right bye-bye bye-bye  yeah um okay i'm uh we're not that we're not that big at dining out but uh in fact i guess since since uh we don't make it uh uh make a big hobby of it or anything we're we're really into uh we're interested in economy and uh you know a nice enough atmosphere that you can carry on a conversation uh-huh good food i mean that's important too yeah that sounds about what we i mean we go out to places i mean we don't go to places where we all dress up and all that you know and all that we try to get uh you know some place that you know that's a little better than home and all but you know it's not going to cost a ton of money either right right yeah well well we've got three kids and so uh and so uh i guess there's there's two kinds of dining out there's dining out with the kids and dining out without the kids huh all right and uh when we're dining out with the kids the the great places are those where you you know i don't uh are you uh you in Texas no i'm in uh Maryland Maryland well they've got a couple of places here i'm in i'm calling from Texas um there's a place that you know i can feed the five of us for under fifteen dollars and and it's all you can eat and uh that that's the kind of place that you take the kids to yeah well i'd go there all five i mean how how old are the kids well they they range from four to eleven and that's pretty impressive uh yeah oh well i i was amazed because we lived uh i'd lived uh in Virginia i was born and raised in Virginia and then uh we spent uh about ten years in New Hampshire uh-huh uh-huh and dining out especially with the kids has always been a major you know thing yeah we're we're having a kid in October and it's like well you know no more no more eating out for a while oh right but uh i was i was just amazed there's this one place called CC's pizza uh-huh and it's all you can eat and it's for for grown ups its like four dollars and it's like i don't even think it's four dollars it's three dollars and something and for the for the the uh eight year old and the eleven year old it's it's like uh two dollars and something and for the four year old it's a dollar something oh that's incredible and it's all you can eat and it's decent pizza you know and it comes with a salad bar too but i mean the salad bar is essentially lettuce and carrots uh-huh but uh but you know it's good enough to eat and then um there's uh another place called Pancho's Course they have to have Mexican food and uh the uh uh-huh the uh the grown ups eat for four dollars and something and the and the uh the eight and eleven year old eat for uh two dollars and something and the four year old eats for free and uh the grown ups get all you can eat and the kids have to have can only have like four items uh-huh but you go sit down at a table the great thing about this is you sit down at the table and they have a little Mexican flag and when you raise the Mexican flag the waiter comes over and he just gives you whatever you want we got to look around here find out if there's anything like that around here oh you'll find something like that uh especially when you have kids that's yeah that's incredible i mean we just we're like well we're not going out for a while you know my folks live close you know fairly close here so it's like well we if we're going out to dinner we can drop the kid off at my folks and yeah i know and it's like oh great grandpa you know well Maryland Maryland has some i mean um Maryland has some great seafood doesn't it yeah there's um there's a place i live just outside of Baltimore in a town called Olicott City and uh there's a seafood place here called the Crab Shanty that's really good it's like rated higher than like the the seafood restaurants down in the inner harbor in Baltimore you know the the trendy section of Baltimore uh-huh wow yeah and uh you know we've eaten there sometimes and it's pretty good it's you know it's a little more expensive than than i normally like to spend plus the other thing is i'm not uh i'm not a big seafood fan yeah so you know it's like great we go to the Crab Shanty and i'm going to have veal you know oh so what's what's eating out cheap for you is McDonald's or something like that not that bad there's some well actually we've been we end up doing a lot is uh there's a couple of places around that are like uh yuppie i mean it it seems like a big thing now with uh with diners uh diners oh yeah the back to the fifties yeah there's um there's a place up in my my folks actually live up in Delaware and there's a place up there that we like to go to called um The Hop which is you know just a fifties diner basically and then there's um a chain around here called Silver Diner uh-huh right yeah um and you know you and uh let's see there's another one up in uh just north of Baltimore called Ralphie's Diner huh Ralphie's yeah um it was fun i'm uh i'm a baseball fan i you know my my girlfriend's like you know she she puts up with me being a baseball fan you know but uh we go we walk into this place Ralphie's Diner and i look on the wall and there's like uh yeah there's like uh like a relief of the of of the guy who Ralphie's Diner is named after and it turns out he used to work for the Orioles and she's like no not more baseball yeah oh no kidding but um all these places you know you can get like you know a hamburger or um you know um i've had turkey and meatloaf at all these diners and you know we usually get out of there for around twenty bucks yeah yeah that's okay yeah you know it's good food and everything and um you know you get malts or whatever so it's really good you know my only big gripe is every time i've gone to Silver Diner i have tried to get the banana cream pie and they they are always out yeah yeah always out yeah we had a place like that that had uh in Virginia it was called Bill's Barbecue and they had the grest uh-huh greatest banana cream pie and it was was uh you could take it home it was was just it was so popular it was great stuff and now now my mouth mouth's watering i'm beginning to think about that yeah the uh yeah twenty dollar that's oh sorry we can do pretty that's that's what we try to aim for just the two of us or naw you know if we want to have some wine or something we start get into the forty dollar range i guess and well neither of us are big wine d rinkers yeah we went out tonight and i had a you know i had a beer and and you know obviously since you know she's we're not we've been kind of laying off the alcohol since she's expecting and all that yeah yeah yeah sure sure but we i mean even before i mean usually we you know we might have a beer but that's about it so yeah yeah that's the same well we'll go to a place and of course being in Texas we'll go to a place and the big thing is frozen margaritas margaritas and uh so we'll have some nachos and drink and they they serve these margaritas in yeah i don't know do do you ever go to Howard Johnson's in uh i i don't know if there are even any Howard Johnson's around any more you used to get an ice cream sundae in that big old goblet yeah there are yeah well that's how that's what they serve these margaritas in these frozen margaritas it's just huge things yes i've seen them i know that uh Chi Chi's has margaritas in big glasses like that yeah yeah yeah Chi Chi's they they have Chi Chi's down here too but that's that's sort of looked down upon because they're a chain oh oh yeah well i i i would i mean you know they've got them out here because it's you know they don't actually know what Mexican you know what Mexican food is here right yeah right well i didn't either i mean you know to me Pancho's where i can where i can eat for less than fifteen bucks to me that's gourmet and everybody i say i went to Pancho's they all down at me down their noses you know it's like uh it's all right with me yeah well we've been to some what what have been rated fancy Mexican restaurants and uh they were good i have to say they were good huh yeah i've got to try i um years ago um we we're uh my folks were um we were visiting Los Angeles or something and i remember being taken to a real fancy Mexican restaurant there called Senor something Senor Pico or something like that and yeah you know i hated everything at the time i just hated Mexican food i'd i'd love to go to some place like that now where it's you know a real Mexican restaurant and see if i like it did you Mexican yeah yeah yeah yeah what kind of what kind do you like uh like Chinese or Italian or i um i like Chinese and i should experiment more the problem is that my favorite food in the world is cashew chicken so any time i go to a Chinese restaurant i want cashew chicken oh yeah my wife too that's her favorite too yeah you know it's funny with Chinese restaurants since you can't read the menu or anything you tend to stick with one thing i used to it used to always be sweet and sour pork for me and then i just i i started getting a little more health conscious uh-huh and i try to uh you know try something else you know something with a little more vegetables or something but yeah i was the same way but we haven't really eaten Chinese that much since we've been in uh Texas it's funny i was just thinking the same thing it's like we haven't had Chinese in a while let's have a shake up we get this uh there's this take out Chinese place that i mean you know stone's throw from my apartment here yeah right yeah yeah and uh we can get they do this thing for dinner for two where we can get like um Kung Pao chicken you know it's a big you know container full Kung Pao chicken um pork fried rice two egg rolls and like you know um yeah um you know i don't know a pint or two pints or whatever of a wanton soup for like twelve fifty yeah ooh what a deal yeah yeah it's great we should have done that tonight that sounds great well you know it's funny because the grocery store down the street it's one of these you know super grocery stores they have a a Chinese take-out um in the corner of it and the food's decent but it's expensive i think especially since it's all take out uh-huh uh yeah i'm well i like Italian food too but you don't there aren't that many Italian restaurants around here there's um i'm trying to think there's a French restaurant real close but we've never gone there because i'm not yeah oh i'm you know i'm not a big French you know i i don't eat i'm into quantity and French the French restaurants aren't yeah well i also i also don't do snails so right it seems to me there's an Italian deli nearby that's pretty good uh well of course when we  okay the public school systems well everybody's known has known they've needed renovation for years but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it uh-huh the first direction that i can see or i wish i would love to see them go with kids learn at different rates and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together you'd learn at this rate and that's the only way it's going to happen yeah that's true you've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it and the rest the other fifty seven minutes you've been talking about a subject you've bored them yeah yeah that's that's very true um i guess i can relate to that because i have two kids that are opposites like that uh one picks up real quick and the other one doesn't and you're right they do get bored uh really fast if they already know what you're talking about what do you propose that they do what what is your suggestions the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with uh the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person uh-huh out of each child out of each child some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff other kids are going to be each individual child really into math some are really going to be heavy into reading right instead of pushing the scales too far either direction i mean it's great to be well rounded and have be exposed to all this stuff yeah that's but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in because if he's interested he's going to study it and he's going to learn it and he's going to remember it that's true the only i think the only thing that they would argue about that is that you know every child needs to learn every subject i mean that's that might be the only thing but i mean i i definitely agree with you um they need exposure to every subject they don't need to be masters of it right right that's true everything i learned about ancient Rome has has not helped me anywhere in my adult life um yes i definitely agree there's no doubt about that i uh i i mean i can relate to that because i'm i'm going to college right now and i feel like i mean i'm taking this history class and i mean it's so boring and i just hate it and i think why do they make us take this stuff i mean what does this have to do with getting you know a computer science degree or whatever you know what what type of history class is it that you're having to take uh American History we have to take um like this is like early seventeen hundreds through i don't know i think like mid eighteen hundreds and then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up to basically present well the early ones they could actually combine two two levels of it the one from seventeen hundred until yeah say the end of the Civil War combine that into one and then from eighteen sixty five to present and make that your second step because yeah that's well that's basically what they're doing to a point to a point the bottom you know the early parts of it you're giving the foundations of the nation and but even then they're skimming over they're very trivial almost trivial with it yeah oh yes definitely i agree they want if i mean if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter i mean there's yeah there's they make all these people out to be oh they were great men and they're the father of the country and all this he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else if not more the man was not a saint yeah that's true yeah any way this this um school system thing i i tell you i saw something on the news oh i don't know maybe two weeks ago and they were talking about i don't know where you're from but i'm from the Dallas area and they were talking about the Plano school system that they had one school that uh if the students did something wrong i mean whether it was behavioral or uh you know they weren't learning properly or something they took these students and put them basically in a closet with no windows they had a a table or not a table but a desk in this closet and they had to sit in there by themselves well parents were getting really angry about this because they said why is my child being put in this closet well how is that helping my child you know and uh the the thing you know they said well we're giving them isolation time and this helps them to think but a lot of kids i mean if a child has uh claustrophobia i mean that's just going to terrify him you know and if if the isolation concept really works that good why are our prisons overcrowded uh that's true that's true but no i mean they were uh i mean i definitely agree with parents i think that is a very wrong way to handle uh disciplining a child putting them in i mean they were they were called they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms they didn't call them closets but they showed these rooms on uh you know on the news and i mean they looked like a closet to me you know with a desk in it a real small but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms i said now what good does this i mean how is this helping i mean either way you know i i definitely had to disagree with that i think that is that's not the way to handle a child you know discipline a child by putting him in a closet the the um as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that level the public school system i want to see changed too when i was brought brought up if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough you were going to get spanked well then the extreme came in and now we can no longer spank them so we now isolate them right right yep uh okay we've swung the pendulum both ways let's find a middle ground instead of there has to be some sort of discipline and there has to be some sort of punishment right short of physically isolating the child and short of physically hitting the child well let's put him into a situation where okay you crossed the line you broke the rule you're going to have to pay for it right but it's going to tax you physically uh-huh i i don't have the i mean instead instead have have them pick up around the school yard have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yard do something to beautify the school property yeah that's true but you cut you know the the kid's having to give up his quote play time to uh pay his debt for what he did wrong but he's seeing something c onstructive come out of it well um i have to i think one of the positive things i mean one of the things that can come out of uh is not just discipline discipline okay but okay for instance one of the things they do at uh my kids school uh they have what they call uh caught being good slips and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good i mean just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on they're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips and then when they collect them at the end of each week they get to go to this little what they call their caught being good store and then they get to spend these like money well see to me that's positive reinforcement is much better much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids because they're going to be good and try and earn those things you know to get the positive part of it i mean they'd rather much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked so they're definitely going to work towards being good you know rather than trying to act up and be bad you know i think that not only applies inside the public school system but in society itself we've been too long there's been too much negative reinforcement how much day like the caught being good slips how about just the John Q citizen out there on the street yeah well that's true i think i think really though i mean that's one thing that i mean my kids definitely get spanked when they need they need to be spanked but i really do try to use positive uh reinforcement with them at home also and it really helps and i mean they they don't get spanked very often but they they do when they deserve it you know but uh i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked i mean i i think i wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child but you know that's just my personal opinion and that's not going to i mean i don't think that law will ever change they are never going to let a a teacher spank a child again but i don't think i mean some kids don't get don't get spanked at home and some kids need to be spanked at home i mean don't you think i most most most wholeheartedly agree but i don't know i mean there's a point of over kill but somewhere in you've got to find an even line right right well there's so many parents that say you can deal with a child without spanking them which is true you can but there are times when a child needs to be spanked i mean they do things that they need that need that shock effect where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked right  the uh whole savings and loan thing seems to be uh a bit of a system whereby the the natural human greed was able to flourish and some people were able to do some things that that uh they they felt that since the government was backing them they could just uh go ahead and make these transactions and make these loans and get all this money as it were and it was rather difficult to catch all if if any of the people that were really responsible for it and even those who were caught didn't seem to get get much in the way of punishment as far as getting a restitution made so it seems like a a really set up you know the whole thing was set up to to be abused and so human nature did so yeah i think the oh yeah yeah i think the government is it's own worst enemy about the time it was all going on they were trying to run a loose monetary policy anyhow to stimulate the economy and plus they had cut back on the way of government regulators to even investigate or keep a watchdog on the whole industry and uh i think the whole economic situation was set up to uh put the savings and loans in the position they were in and they mainly the banks too uh economically we had gotten into pretty unsound conditions and so the idea of trying to make the money supply good and loose via whatever medium whether it be savings and loans or banks either one was the order of the day so needless to say they did and uh since they didn't really regulate it well or watch it well uh by cutting back on uh government uh uh uh monitoring in that respect then it did get out of hand and you're right you're absolutely right there were some people who saw the situation for what it was and they took advantage of it and uh because of it you and i are the main taxpayers now are going to have to pay not only for the burden of the bad investments that they made but we're going to have to pay for the uh mistakes in the uh uh taking advantage of the system to some of these well really when you get right down to it crooks uh uh took advantage of the system with and yeah they've seem to caught a few i i've heard on TV or read in uh the newspaper about a couple of these guys i forget the the name of one of them but i heard that they did uh prosecute him and maybe a couple of others i think you all had a major crisis down there in Texas right yeah there were quite a few down here mainly by just because of the sheer numbers that were here and you know the and the chances of getting a bad one would be greater just out of the sheer population of them being here and the whole problem seemed to start start toward uh uh not that California was the instigator of it but it seemed to start out that way and then then work its way here and it wasn't kind of funny that it wasn't a national problem until it hit the east coast yeah yeah that's always interesting isn't it see he's right you know when it started hitting the big New York banks and the up then it became a nationwide problem and Congress got to do something but oh yeah uh Texas is on basically on the way to recovery as far as uh the banking industry goes and they oh i'm glad to hear that because i've been concerned that the banks may be going the same direction that the savings and loans primarily because uh what got the savings and loans in trouble is the same sort of things that's beginning to get the banks in trouble and that was uh the real estate uh backing in investment and just building in general backing contractors and those kinds of uh corporations uh who were trying to build a lot of uh uh rental business space and uh mall type space and things like that and uh it looked like in the seventies that that was going to be a real booming thing uh a infinitum i guess um-hum and uh anybody if they just stop and use a little common sense would realize well you can't soak up this much real estate uh and continue to have this kind of growth indefinitely i mean you you it's it's like anything eventually reach sort of a plateau where you've overbuilt if you're not careful right uh and uh it it's as if uh they went crazy just just like in gambling almost um-hum and there there was no regulation or anything like that uh i i frankly though and and i'm glad to hear you say what you said about Texas because i have been concerned that the banking system uh which is going through some economic difficulty now and with all the foreign investments that they uh put money into also i i've been concerned that the banking system is going to find itself in dire straits or if they even didn't find themselves in dire straits we're going to find ourselves with so much of our money uh lent out to foreign owners who are willing to soak up some of this this uh capital to keep us afloat you might say hoping to make a buck off of us in interest in the future but uh we find our own economic economy even though it may not have slipped into so so some kind of either deflationary or inflationary depression uh we find ourselves having sold out our futures in terms of what we are going to have to pay off all this debt with to foreign investors who have the money to build to buy up all the debt um-hum and uh i'm glad to hear that you do you know uh how uh they're beginning to get over the feet in Texas are are is a lot of the money in loans and and the like that uh uh is that being covered by foreign investments maybe or or uh well part of the problem as i see it uh my family's involved in in both industries as it were i've i've got a grandfather that was in the um-hum um-hum S and L back in the sixties and the seventies and in another part of Texas and in a uh okay my immediate parents were both in banking as it were and so uh we've we've kept up with the industry as it were and the the feeling has been in some of the discussions that that get started on that topic has been that you know we went through the the bad times of a number of bad loans and fortunately the the banks and the S and Ls that uh our family were associated with really didn't have that much problem they were fairly conservative and um-hum they just had to ride out the storm with the the reputational problems that came with the news media as it were and yeah uh there were a number of banks that made the bad loans and basically it's been a good weeding out process there's just been a lot of people a lot of banks a lot of whole organizations that were going to make these kinds of loans and and they are no longer in business uh so you know you you have some all your bank failures that the government's having to take over you know that's gone up in the hundred and twenty or thirty or so for the state yeah it's been quite a few every year yeah and that's pretty well leveled off and and the that's well do you think maybe it's peaked you think yeah yeah i don't think there's going to be that many more of them i i would so you you you you would uh predict based on at least your knowledge and experience that in time we'll see the numbers of banks and maybe savings and loans too if they're still failing uh that that that the the number beginning to sort of taper off now instead of a hundred to two hundred a year you begin to see it go down to maybe fifty to a hundred a year and maybe right right there's just not that many more what kind of time frame frame would you guess that's going to take to wring itself out well it's hard to say how many more bad bad systems or bad apples there are out in the system but i would i'd be willing to bet that uh it shouldn't be more than a couple more years that that oh you think two years i i would have guessed five to ten but you really think two years well the as far as as far as not having this getting over this peak as it is now uh there's still going to be an unusual uh-huh uh-huh you know it depends on how far back you want to go let's say if you went back ten years and said here's a failure rate we could live with well then it may take us three to five years to get back to that level of failure oh okay but if you want to just say we're over the hump and we're starting to get better i think in a couple of years it'll be quite obvious that we're over the hump and getting better well tell me well all this all these bad loans and debts that uh i i know in the case of the savings and loans we're just going to have to pick it up as American taxpayer um-hum but even the banks and the likes some some of those are merging and uh uh the the the the basic question i'm trying to get to is all this bad money that's essentially not going to get paid back how's it going to get covered i'm not sure if uh i mean is inflation going to make some of it go away and the rest of it we're going to pick up the tab as taxpayers or are we going to be able to sell some of these bad loans or pick them up somehow or another uh uh by foreign investors uh buying pieces of our our economy like buying some of our been to some of our banks uh like the things that uh i forget the guy's name downtown here uh was involved in those two banks i think that was in Georgia or someplace uh what what what how do see that this this indebtedness of which is bad loans and the like just not going to get paid back at least by the people who caused the debt uh you you can't just write that off completely you can write off a certain part of it i guess but you just can't just write off the whole somewhere along the line you've got to recoup some of that money some of the even if it's twenty five to fifty cents on the dollar right how how how's that going to happen well like one guy i heard just talking earlier this week on the topic was saying that that there wasn't any one given uh you know sort of like a uh suit guy making a uh suit for you it it's custom made to the individual situation if you you don't try to find well write off all these to the government or have have the the entire uh bank failure covered by the government so you you take each individual situation yeah and if you can find a foreign investor or if you can find any investor that'll that'll finance i guess that's what the majority of the uh RTC is doing is trying to uh-huh to resolve all these individual cases in any way possible i mean they're looking for how good a job do you think they're doing because you know there's been quite a bit in the various news magazines up here and even the Washington Post and various places about uh how they felt that the uh the people on the committee were sort of selling out at uh exorbitantly exorbitantly low prices to some rather astute investors some of this had been misinterpreted who were tending the who were really tend to make the nice killing off that how do you how do you feel about that well i was i was talking with another gentleman about that same topic it's hard to get a feel for what's going on in a nationwide uh system like that when the news media reports the segments that they report you know you hear yeah mainly they look for the the wild news yeah you hear things like uh the  okay well i have two boys actually they're nine years old and uh five and a half actually almost six now and they're in kindergarten and uh fourth grade how about yourself there we go uh how many children do you have Jamie a uh oh we've got we've got three but they're they're kind of older children now uh we've got a daughter twenty three that's a senior in college a daughter nineteen who's a freshman in college and a son seventeen who's a senior in high school okay oh my um-hum i see what what kind of activities do you do with them well you now they're especially the older one uh they they're into their sports and their friends a lot you know the younger one's getting into it more uh what we enjoy doing with them which we started a year ago was um we go on fishing you know day time trips with them the younger one especially is really good at it he enjoys fishing um they like to go to a place here called uh Chuckie Cheese which is really like a crazy arcade type of thing has a lot of games um and we you know we like to do outdoors types of things with them um yeah i just got a bike myself because i'm hoping you know eventually maybe you know for hikes or you know going out along the canal area or whatever to ride bikes with them oh sure and um you know we enjoy um we enjoy doing more things outdoor playing ball with them my husband likes to play freeze tag with them and and i think as American parents we probably we spend more time than is typical i think uh with the kids and part of that is that they're demanding of it you know they they want our time oh yeah uh and uh my husband enjoys you know doing those things with them he spends a lot of time with them and it seems to me anyway from observing other families in the neighborhood that he spends a lot more time i'd say on the average than um a lot of the dads do here and i think that's good i think it's real important i think i think uh i think that is and and we we got involved really in in two ways uh my oldest daughter i guess when she went uh was in the first grade brought home a note saying uh we're getting up a soccer team and we're getting a chance to play soccer um-hum and uh so gee you know this was nineteen seventy three and none of us had ever seen a soccer game so then so then we go out and watch it and she enjoys it and they play the fall season and spring season so she played two seasons in the first grade and right was pretty good at it and then in the second grade they said uh oh the coach moved away uh call all the parents and say well who's going to uh coach well no gee you know well we really don't have enough time for that um-hum uh oh then about the third call they said we want to know we're going to refund the contracts and the money for these kids because nobody's going to coach and think that's terrible so at that point you know you come forward well that started about a fifteen year career of coaching uh coaching administering programs and my wife and i in addition to coaching i think when we finally finished up we were managing oh my goodness uh as our volunteer time managing a program with seventy two hundred kids in it from grades uh kindergarten through twelfth grade and year around baseball softball soccer and i well i think that's really good though because i'm sure those are memories they'll always keep oh they are are and and and you know my twenty three year old she's a senior in college and she comes in now and she just loves to pick out the picture book we took a lot of pictures at the time dad do you remember that sixth grade team we had that year dad God we were great weren't we um-hum yeah that's right i and i really uh i really think it's very important and i'm very sensitive to it because i always felt that my parents are more uh old school and they were older parents and they didn't do a lot of things with us that way and i always felt that i missed out that way and so i want to make sure that we spend a lot of time doing activities with the kids and i think a lot of times the parents have fun as well and uh you know now that summer's coming of course i'm sure in Dallas it's already hot but up here oh yeah i'll say well we've had last weekend we had eighty seven which was extraordinarily hot for now but now we're back down to about fifty and it's raining here but um yeah uh you know soon next end of next month the pools are open the outdoor pools only open over the summer yeah oh sure that'll help yeah and that's an activity that i you know take up with the kids and we're starting to hit some tennis balls around uh but as as they're getting more fun for us as well and i find that starting to doing more of those types of things as they get a little bit older um but yeah i was going to say what do you feel in general do you feel that um American families are spending spending enough time with their children or what changes do you well now i i think that they're not uh uh i see too many uh you i recognize that yes a a lot of families need two incomes in fact my wife's working as we the kids all start college and we're looking forward to the prospect of having three in there uh they they have to right uh both work but another activity that i found very rewarding and i don't know whether you've got it up there are Indian Guides and Indian Princess programs um popular in that area okay well what this is is it's it's really sponsored by the Y but it's nonsectarian uh is that it's the concept was no no i haven't heard of that um-hum that i think it originally started with Indian Guides and uh the idea was that dads are off working all the time and mothers are left to raise the kids i see so uh uh it it it is a program that requires uh dads and just and it started out with with fathers and sons um-hum where they get together in what they call tribes which is a neighborhood with probably five or six maybe up to eight uh father son combinations and they get together and and meet at each other's home uh maybe uh twice a month i see um-hum uh to uh uh have uh uh games and uh work on crafts and work on projects and and refreshments and you take Indian names and wear headbands and act like in and uh learn a little about Indian right uh things but then uh the highlight is that you go camping twice a year like you go out to some uh camping spot and live outdoors uh in the fall and in the spring and you like you go out on a Friday night and come back on Sunday morning and it is uh it's to force oh i see oh that's nice uh the kids away from the mothers for a little a little bit and it's even to the point where the host family at the meetings at each other's homes have to provide uh uh have to provide refreshments and they've got to be cooked by you and you can't say mom make some cookies for us oh i see so part of the thing is when the father and son or father and daughter are hosting this meeting that the week they have to plan it together what they're going to do when they're the host um-hum and what was interesting i got started in Indians and Princesses now an offshoot to this was i think this program went on maybe for thirty years or so and somebody got to thinking well it's even more important i see um-hum it's even more important for dads and daughters yeah to get involved in something like this because a lot of families think well you know i i i'll bring up the son mom and you bring up the daughters yeah and they don't notice the daughters until they're fourteen or fifteen and start getting into trouble so uh uh because my son was the third one i really got into it with both of the girls first right yeah i see and uh we just had a ton of fun and i i look back now as i say the the two girls are both in college but when they're here and we're we're talking about and we're digging out the old pictures books and my twenty we took a lot of eight millimeter movies oh that's good of uh of uh Indian Princess camp and my uh uh my my twenty three year old has has hoarded all the movies now and and and just sets up the projector in her room and watches them every once in a while uh going back to things like that and boy those these are so many precious things that you can't ever buy back and and to answer your question that's right that's right yeah i i don't see it we've got a lot of younger fa milies in our neighborhood and everybody's so busy out there making a living uh you can see why the well i know uh right uh my daughter who's a freshman in college this year her last couple of years in high school she made money money baby sitting and you can tell by the number of people that would have her come and and spend the day um-hum uh my goodness she went out on one job she was only seventeen i can't believe the lady gave it to her she said she interviewed nineteen people and she was the one she hired this was uh a three week old oh my oh boy she went to the house at eight o'clock in the morning and and both these uh uh there were there was an only child um-hum and both parents were professional uh they were professional people i mean he was an engineer and she was a computer programmer yeah but she went to work at eight o'clock in the morning and Tracy'd get there at seven thirty and have complete charge of this then three week old until the mother came home at uh at four or four thirty oh my yeah right right yeah i think and i think that's uh uh part of the problem now i was uh uh i was in engineering myself um right now i'm taking uh a year off but uh it was it's very difficult even when i worked i insisted on working thirty hours not forty so i was really considered part time and that was kind of difficult because that concept when you get into professions like that isn't really there yet so i really had to hound them for that i was a civil engineer what what kind of engineering were you in oh okay and it was really important for me to be able to be out in time to swing by the school and pick my son up um-hum and of course the younger one was in day care but you find even working six hours a day and not eight hours or whatever that it cuts into your time so much and what happens really is that even though i had the time with them in the evenings all the things that you you you know normally you can get done during the week um you save up for the weekend so your whole weekend that your kids really want your attention but you're saying oh can you go play now or whatever because you have so many things to catch up on yeah and i think that's what you know i think it really uh that's what makes it very makes it difficult and uh this year's much more relaxed yeah you know and um a lot of people said they've seen very big changes in my boys for the better you know and um i think that you know i've i've done both sides and it's it's no matter what people say it it is too difficult  so that the topic is hobbies in your spare time yeah who has spare time um i don't really don't really do any handicraft things like that i used to i used to do like salt dough ornaments and things uh-huh but that was oh good many many years ago and i have i really my spare time i usually go do aerobics and yeah read and that's about it yeah yeah i understand that i'm you know i work full time and i have two kids so my spare time usually involves something with the kids yeah you know hobbies we i i can't really say that we have hobbies it's more like maybe yeah projects or something on the weekend you know we like to go out go out yeah family well well that's what i meant by salt that we we did that like as a family little ornaments and things like that and just kind of really got into it like during the Christmas season making them up for other people and things like that but oh uh-huh right um-hum as far as i've just never been very skilled at far you know needle work wise and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good and uh uh-huh i've i guess mostly as far as as crafts go i've done um some needlepoint and i've done mostly cross stitching i used to uh do like um one that i did for both kids are like oh they're plaques with you know different kind of animals and then you have their birth date on them and then you have a little picture of them and you frame them and stuff but nothing steady just yeah um-hum when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it but you know it's nothing that i can really it's not like you sit and knit every night yeah i don't even know how to knit and my mother used to knit you know all the time and and i don't even know how to knit and i'm like that's a lost art from this family no not at all uh-huh yeah so um but it's not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when you're neither neither one of us are really no i i have seen things i really like you know that were done uh-huh especially like needlepoint needlepoint cushions and things but it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it you know that and that the petty point and things like that it's like God it just just seems like it's yeah yeah easier just to go out and buy it already made i don't know what what what is it's like there but here a lot of the country stuff is in you know lot of the woodwork a lot of uh stenciling yeah and you know you can go to any like a flea market and stuff and there's just tons of stuff everywhere and yeah you know people just do it in their garage and then on weekends they go out and sell it and during the week they go back and do some more and see they do that as their job whereas you know for us it and they make it cheaper for us to buy so right yeah definitely but and i i mean i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that because i can remember when i used to do you know those little salt dough figurines and things it was it was relaxing you know creative you felt very creative um-hum but it just was so time time involved you know so much time involved and the different steps and things yeah um-hum so and okay well i think i think we're okay i think we did done five minutes so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore okay well thank you yeah so okay i hope you have a good rest of your weekend okay bye-bye thanks bye-bye  okay so Jan how do they recycle in Texas well i the biggest uh way it's going right now uh lot most of the grocery stores um-hum have got uh things set up so where you can bring in your uh plastic and your cans and newspapers and then they've just got different barrels sitting out i shouldn't say barrels like big John Doors or whatever they're called Gondolas um they've got them set outside and uh-huh yeah yeah and uh is it is it all voluntary yes it's all voluntary now they do have some places where you can take things and get cash but i think the lot of people don't really want the cash you know they just want to uh help recycle which is what we do you know we right um-hum yeah um-hum probably the only thing sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in and we let the kids get the money for that but uh for right yeah there's a a lot of projects where the the Boy Scouts and things and that will collect your cans and it's a good fund raiser for the kids right right yeah that's true but but that's really the the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating you know but um-hum i guess i you see i guess it depends on your landfill space um-hum i know i we're in Maryland but my i from Pennsylvania and my parents how are forced recycling oh really uh yeah all plastic they have all plastic has to go into a recycling bin all cans have to be recycled all newspapers have to be recycled oh wow because they're um they're just running out of space and landfills uh Pennsylvania Ohio and New York are some of the uh they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones yeah so it's really uh it's uh really hard on them now up here in Maryland though we're just just in a voluntary recycling stage right now so uh so my wife and i you know we save our bottles and we save our newspapers and we save all of our plastic and all of our tin cans and just like you say we go to uh a community area where they have it set up and we dump them off there so it's all about you say it is all voluntary do they yeah it's still voluntary though i think i think we're supposed to have something impeme implemented by nineteen ninety three though will it be mandatory where some aspects will be mandatory um-hum is it all um is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff or is it all mostly just the cans okay yeah that's and i and most of the time like i said that's that's a sort of like fund raiser things that the schools do or that the Boy Scouts do or whatever right right yeah that's true that's true yeah um-hum cans are the only thing i think you really get money for well they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers and stuff like that but um-hum you know i think a lot of people like i said are more concerned with you know right now you know the aspects of saving the earth um right um-hum yeah and i think that's mostly well you know we even before as soon as the community said you know we're going to put up bins for recycling you know we automatically um-hum right started doing it it was it's one of those things you know and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be separated you know that's um-hum well i tell you it's kind of funny now at even even at TI i don't do you work for TI okay no hum-um um at TI they're doing recycling i mean for a long time they didn't do this but now they're they're recycling cans and paper we have separate bins um-hum yeah uh separate wastebaskets in our offices for paper um-hum yeah you know and they i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees and you know right it's really i can't believe that you know because they've got it all posted all over the place how much they're saving and how well yeah yeah how much how well they're doing yeah we do i um i i work in a uh speech interface lab at a at a at a college oh okay and we do basically the same thing the state of Maryland has lost asked all the colleges and universities and some of the large organizations you know if they would definitely recycle their office paper um-hum um-hum and the same thing you know every almost every college in Maryland is recycling office paper but you know in the giant bins around and it's surprising how much yeah you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night right yep so you don't think about it you don't notice until you start leaving yeah they don't pick up your recycling until it's full and you just can't believe how much paper that you uh right i know reams of paper come out of an office every day they just asked me to recycle yep yeah well you think about the waste even i mean you know cost wise and and you know like you saving saving trees and stuff like that i mean it's just amazing you know the difference um-hum right yeah so i think hopefully if you know i guess a lot of the large organizations probably TI did they advertise on television how successful they are no i haven't seen anything uh but that doesn't mean that they don't i don't watch much TV but i haven't really seen anything advertised publicly some yeah yeah um-hum i mean like i said they do a lot of internal advertising on that kind of stuff but i haven't seen anything internal um-hum yeah see i don't see a lot of TI advertisements on TV anyway i think they advertise more um other places where they're not located right yeah that would probably be true you know so so i don't see a lot of advertisements for TI um-hum yeah because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television you know they'll just come up and say you know they'll show you they'll to encourage to encourage recycling right they'll say and here those of us at Dalmarva Power which is our power company you know we now recycle forty five percent of our solid waste and they uh-huh right and uh we do this for the community they put those on so i so i think you know we're probably reaching a successful stage and and just with voluntary i think right well even i mean in the kid's schools i mean they do things to try and recycle and um-hum i know my kids um like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say oh look at that somebody is not saving the earth you know so i mean the kids i mean they're really trying to educate all ages you know and it's good to start the kids real young right yeah yeah i think so too yeah and stuff like that because i mean when i was a kid they never did stuff like that i mean it's like nobody was concerned about it you know and it's like right yeah we weren't concerned yeah that's true you know it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things saying hey you know we're ruining the earth you know and now everybody is doing something about which is good um-hum um-hum but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know yeah i i think really probably what hit people's you know i know that here in the up in the uh uh the the New England area and also in in Pennsylvania Ohio and New York the just run all of a sudden we're out of landfill um-hum and then they're saying we we estimate this landfill will be over will be full in two years unless we cut back um-hum and even then you know we're really running out of space so i think that that became that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space in some of the more crowded states well yeah this is so what you know and no no other state i'm sure Texas probably still has some landfill space they're not going to voluntarily say hey ship your garbage here right yeah that's true so you know realistically you know we had we really had to start we have to start recycling in some some uh geographic areas it's really tough i think that it it really surprises me because of the cost savings i mean this is such a tremendous amount of cost savings i mean why um-hum i can't understand why nobody saw that before i mean even even not um-hum even the aspects of not saving the earth i mean it's so cost you know right yeah though well well in some ways i guess it it doesn't become really cost savings until you have an industry around it you know because i know that like in Pennsylvania well yeah they require them to um put their newspaper for recycling but the deinking process that they have to they use to take the ink out of the newspaper so it can be reused um-hum uh-huh um is very expensive and also it waste it produces a a waste a um a liquid waste that they don't know what to do with yet oh oh i see okay so even some aspects of recycling is not real cost efficient oh okay okay oh i understand that though still have cost yeah cost efficient yet yeah so but others you know like tin cans and plastics are are really uh efficient you know they uh they melt they melt on quickly and can be you know just because of the heating and things yeah and glass yeah uh-huh right and glass right um-hum so yeah it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before yeah that's true and even i i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil um-hum yeah um-hum and i mean that kind of surprises me i mean you know because once oil gets so you know thick and yucky you'd wonder how they could you know clean that up enough to use it again but they can yeah um-hum um i don't know how cost efficient that would be i guess yeah i don't i don't know either that's i know that though i even all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your um the water table you know they really pollute quickly and um-hum you know one i was what reading some place that the brake fluid you put brake fluid normally comes in just small little pint containers um-hum that one pint of brake fluid can contaminate so many gallons of water you know like hundreds of gallons of water wow so it's one of those things that they really um and you wonder you know with all these oil spills yeah how how terrible that is yeah how terrible that is so we'll have to we'll have to keep our eyes on all that i guess yeah i know really i know i really i don't know i i think that i mean i think that they really are doing a good thing now and i hope it keeps it well i'm sure it'll keep up um-hum yeah i agree you know i think it's really catching on you know i i think that um-hum i'm not sure if it i don't know i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory i do too um because like we were asking some people that live in um North Dakota well are you saving your you know are you recycling and they said well we're not forced to do it yet so no um-hum you know so i mean i don't know i think that if people are forced if the people are not forced to do it they may not you know i mean i don't know i think a lot of people still still still will but yeah it well you know if they're forced to do it becomes sort of a habit right you know i know that it's really funny my parents are forced to do it and they  so uh have you got any repairs done by auto shops on your car or do you do maintenance work or what i uh try to do what i can and uh we have two vehicles uh and uh on the Honda which is the older vehicle um-hum i try to do as much as i can on that on our newer one uh uh mini vans it's all electronic and computers and everything in it still still under warrantee right yeah uh well some things are some things aren't you know yeah not everything's covered by warrantee i don't try to mess with that at all i mean i i can change the oil and do you do any uh body work on the Honda uh no uh no no i do have a place that's rusting i need to get something on it yeah put some paint on it or something to stop the rust like scrape it and paint it right right right i know if you don't get the rust off that's there already that it's just going yeah scrape it and paint it put primer on it then paint it don't put paint over else it'll just continue rusting under it yeah continue on but yeah i was sitting here looking at my Honda manual when i got the call i got the so you you're ready to talk about it yeah yeah right the uh do you so you change like you change your own oil and oil filters yeah yeah i do my own brake brake work on the Honda i just uh i mean i i just finished working on the brakes yeah i i know where you're coming from because i do the i do the minor things to my car right right not the right the things i know how to do i i'm not an expert i don't claim to be uh but i don't right exactly yeah i just do what i can i don't really you know i don't it's like the simple things changing the oil checking the fluids you know rotating tires hum right things like that that you don't need heavy equipment for right seems anymore you need special tools to do a lot of jobs you know and and yeah i'm afraid i'll get something take it taken apart and not remember how to get it back together and then i'd be in big trouble yeah i do know a couple good shade tree mechanics and i call them once in a while for advice and once in a while for advice and once in a while they'll come over and say oh this is how you do it you know and i try to learn yeah but i think a lot of people learn how to do maintenance from whether their father did it you know my didn't do much at all and didn't know much about cars and um-hum as a result i really didn't have that much interest to learn how to maintain fix and maintain cars right right so i didn't learn much growing up and i just after i we bought the cars you know and things got so expensive to take them someplace all the time yeah because it that i decided that i better start learning you know yeah because things go wrong and you don't know what the hell's going on and you don't you don't know where to start right that's right and that's where it costs money well yeah that's that's when i call some friends or something or sometimes i just take it to a place you know and they'll tell me what's wrong and i'll say oh it'll be this much money and i'll say oh well i'm going to think about that that sounds like too much yeah right now and so you know i got to think about that so they'll put it back together i'll take it home and then i'll fix it myself sometimes they charge you you know just to diagnose the problem right some places do some don't right just depends you know how long how long it takes them to figure it out if they can just tell right away those are electronical diagnostics by just listening to it and then they're usually going to charge you you know yeah i have a a fuel injected engine so i don't do anything to the engine you know it's like uh-huh yeah right they're pretty tricky i don't i don't want to mess with it because since i don't know exactly all the ratios you know and everything that all the proportions the fuel and air and compression and all that stuff that needs to be precise and it's controlled by computer i figure i won't mess with that uh-huh right that's how i figure on those things it's just not worth the worth it but i mean i play with everything else that you know that's not too serious you know you can bend it one way and you bend it right back or you know turn it right right just as long as as like you were saying it's not too hard to take apart and put back together i'll try it uh-huh right now that we have two cars i'm not as scared to play with play around because we always have the other car seems like i before i would get the car all apart and realize i needed a part you know and i'm calling all the neighbors and stuff trying to get them to give me a ride down to get my part you know because i don't have another part so now that we have two cars i'm less leery about just going for it have you had any body work done on your car um no no i haven't had any problem that stuff is expensive yeah i know i had an estimate for that little rust spot and they wanted like three hundred bucks yeah i said forget it i can live with it you know if the car's but ten years old now you know yeah i went i went uh i got in a wreck recently and uh well i didn't do much damage to my car but i did some pretty heavy duty damage to the other car i have a plastic bumper uh-huh and i happened to hit the rim of the tire yeah it made like a little semicircular incision on my plastic bumper uh-huh right and and and kind of put little fissures on the on the paint of the bumper because it's plastic so when it bent you know when the plastic bent it kind of cracked on your plastic bumper uh-huh to to change that bumper covering of the plastic cover right was going to run me five hundred bucks uh-huh whoa that's on the other car or your car on my car is that right that just to change the cover you know because do just had to get the that whole cover my my car's a Beretta they had a big big bumper they got on there big white bumper that covers like the whole bottom front of the car that that whole thing you know to be replaced and repainted would cost five hundred dollars uh-huh right and i got this guy to uh to this this uh company i don't know if you ever heard of Maaco Auto Body Shop yeah i've heard of them i got the i talked to the owner and he said that the best thing to do if i wanted to save money was uh the chain to just go ahead and since there was no major damage he could just kind of like fill in the little ridges where the rim hit with some like bond or something and then paint over it and it would look just like new for only two hundred bucks so i did that instead right uh-huh but and it you can't tell you can't tell the difference you know it just looks like a brand new bumper is that right uh-huh and it hey i saved three hundred bucks yeah well you're a student right right so that's important very important yeah it seems anymore for cars or they want want so much to work on a car we've had our car in the dealer or our van and they want they charge like forty five dollars an hour labor yeah i think that's ridiculous isn't it golly they're yeah i i forty five dollars i mean people people get out of college and work for less than that right well the mechanic doesn't see that you know it's the owner or the dealer who sees the big bucks yeah mechanic probably gets about twenty dollars an hour yeah the thing about automobiles they're so unpredictable too you know they're hard to hard to plan ahead for for things yeah like that commercial that you plan for uh the car new car second garage but you didn't plan on breaking down yeah uh-huh ever see that commercial right no i haven't seen that one it's it's pretty good it's i think it's um a bank commercial or something like that and uh it just kind of flashes out these uh partial sentences like you planned on and it says a new garage second car uh-huh and then all a sudden the music in the background changes and it says but you didn't plan on it breaking down that's true that's true i mean it's hard to you know it's hard to say oh i should set aside this much money for repairs on cars because you never know it could cost you nothing or it could cost you three times as much yeah it's hard to plan for those things and when you need to have it fixed you know a lot of times you can't just take it all over town if it uh you know yeah that's true sometime you can but on some things it's you're just stuck and you got to have it towed somewhere or something you just got to got to got to got to make a quick decision i don't know i don't trust a lot of people who work on your cars too i know this one guy that works for dealerships as a at dealerships they replace things they don't fix that's that's uh that's one thing about dealerships is you don't i don't think you get the real quality work at dealerships because they have to work with so many cars it just kind of so they'd just rather replace something and charge you for the new part rather than just you know fixing the part right and the part could be probably fixed you know for a third of the price of of a new one but they that's dealers don't do that yeah they want as much money as they can oh sure sure they do and then they take your old part and sell it to some reconditioning house and make money off of that too yeah you know so anyway well we got to got to have cars in this society not like uh Europe and Japan and some other countries where they have good enough public transportation where you can just yeah but i think get anywhere you need to go anytime you need to get there yeah i think uh i think public transportation will move up though in the future i mean i think we pretty much phased out the bus well i hope so right but i think maybe uh you know um like subways you know public transportation such as subways and monorails will probably come in uh-huh right right but it it's going to be a while i think but well yeah i mean not nothing like in the next ten years but more like in the next fifty to a hundred if i had a car uh the a bus  well this is a good subject isn't it it it's something that you can really talk about um i don't know what we're going to do about it but it's certainly something that has a lot of things to talk about yeah it is yeah um-hum um you know when they say the Middle East it's such a big area and there's so many different problems there um-hum um what do you want to concentrate on it doesn't matter to me well um i'll tell you something um i i have a sister-in-law from Israel um-hum and and they're really quite um arrogant about it all they they believe that they they belong there and they've belonged there forever and the Palestinians and the Arabs are um more or less they they they consider them second class um-hum so they're really quite arrogant about it i don't uh i don't know if that contributes to the problem well how did they feel about the uh the United States intervening intervening with Patriot missiles did did they oh uh i'm sure i'm sure it this is the one time that the Israelis are really happy to have their big brothers the Americans um-hum but i didn't really talk about that with her she um um my sister-in-law now lives in um Switzerland oh but um when they were living in Israel it was it was the the Palestinians they they come in and they're they're nothing but really servants for them and and they really treat them like second class citizens they they don't really want them around but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such but they they really do they look down on them and um-hum i don't know being i i live in uh Vermont and being up here we pretty much treat everybody um-hum you know as someone that has merit even if they are poor or if they're Hispanic or if they're Black we give everybody pretty much the benefit of the doubt because we don't see all the crime and all the hurt in the big cities you know if um-hum uh if i lived in Washington DC i think i'd have a different attitude about Black people because i've heard that it it the they're terrible you know it's just like it's a dog eat dog world and here you know all my all my Black friends are professionals and they're they don't you know they don't go out and abuse drugs and they they send their kids to school and they they just they uh you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff so it's just a different world um-hum well i live in San Antonio and fifty percent of the population is minority oh um i talked to someone about San Antonio um-hum and um they said that they they have you have quite the problem with uh the ghettos i don't know they call it the barrio down there that's the barrios but it's it's it's i don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city it's just Hispanics here instead of Blacks yeah well i heard that that San Antonio unlike like like a city like San Diego it seems it just has it a really bad problem i i i i grew up outside of Houston and i don't think uh as far as gang violence and things i don't think it's any worse here than in Houston yeah like say Houston now i would now me not even knowing anything about Houston i would think that it's a pretty calm city Houston is not at all no huh there's a lot of crime yes there's quite a bit of crime oh my um yeah like i uh we're we're so protected up here it's it's really strange i mean our red light district i mean uh you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life you know and we're just so protected um-hum but it's it's it's over in the Mid East especially Israel it's just like Israelis have a like a totalitarian system when it comes to the Palestinians you know the Israelis can do anything they want but when it comes to Palestinians if they're out in the street at night it's it's really looked on as odd um usually they're they're bussed in to the the um Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish cities and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories hum so they don't have that but um what what do you think about the mess that's we've created in Iraq i think it's unfortunate uh as far as the Kurds are concerned it it's just what do you do for them you want to do something for them but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the the country i you can't yeah yeah we can't get involved in their civil war um unfortunately but we've kind of driven these people out to do it yeah but you see President Bush is telling them rebel you know um uprise uprise and that's what they did and now they're like asking him for help and he's like no we can't get involved what what my husband had very strong feelings he he he he uh agreed with um the General Schwartzkopf he said um that he should have let that Bush should have let him finish his job sure he should've let he should've let them um corner the Republican Guards well i think the war ended too soon yeah exactly that's what everyone says yeah everyone everyone i talk to they say you know it's real easy to say that we we didn't damage enough of their arsenal we damaged most of it but we we should have gotten made sure we got everything yeah i don't think the higher ups were thinking about what what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine they're going oh well it's not going to hurt us so we're just going to let them go but really we didn't think about the people that he was gonna try and i mean he he's just unfortunately though the the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of Kuwait and once that was accomplished they yeah they they did they stuck right to their goals and right what they were going to say and the American people when this first started they were even reluctant to let them do that so they were they were playing it very safe but it yeah yeah you know it an ounce what do they say an ounce of hind sight is worth you know whatever whatever they they yeah i don't know they it Schwartzkopf Schwartzkopf knew what had to be done and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it to you know the uh the go ahead to do it yeah because he had the few he knew what was going to happen more than any of us because i didn't realize that um it was going to make such a mess i mean i feel really sorry for these people these people are middle class people just like us can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood and yeah and you knew this these people are going to come and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you of course you're gonna just gonna pick everything up that you can carry and you're going to run um-hum and it it's just too bad that we couldn't see that i just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet that i i still feel like there's more to come i don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned well you know what i was hoping i was hoping Iran was going to take a very um dramatic stand and invade you know and and like Iran's the big bad guy you know but really if if they were going to save people's lives they've got sixty or so of Iraq's planes yeah i know it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict but i i you know it's almost where i'm kind of disappointed with the Iranians why they didn't go save save i mean i don't know if the Kurdish i know the Shiite's are their people but i don't know i think they have a bond with the the Kurds um-hum there are some Kurds living in Iran yeah i i think they should have just done more uh and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid it's it's just so complicated i'm just real surprised that Israel stayed out of it as as much as they did oh yeah well you knowing them they're very um oh i don't know almost compare them to a very egotistical man well damn right i'm going to protect my family you know so um-hum i i i was amazed too i was really i was really um proud of them though that they stayed out of it but yeah it from from what i can tell if they had gotten into it it would have started a whole new war oh it would have messed yeah i was i that really that part scared me that that um the Egyptians would pull out and i just saw atomic bomb  do you want to start yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i mean well well we just finished watching uh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on tape you know did you watch Dances With Wolves did you see the movie yeah we we've seen that yeah did you like it yeah it was great have you seen it i thought it was very well done yeah i um how about Ghost we we saw an we liked it but you know i didn't think it was as good as all the uh hype was about it right i feel the same way about that too it was okay yeah i don't i i couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for uh best picture no no and uh what let's see uh the most recent ones that i've seen are those two Ghost and uh Dances With Wolves but i rent uh uh videos do you yeah yeah and so we just uh it depends um you know it depends on what you you watch many do you like the classics like uh Gone With the Wind and uh you know the older movies i'd like to see those i keep you know um you know there's like three movies that i i keep telling myself that i should see one of these you know some day that i haven't seen you know that that are classics you know because i've never seen Citizen Kane and never seen yeah that was good i've never seen Casablanca and never seen Gone With The Wind i think i've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies but in in you know a long time ago and uh like the Maltese Falcon and all those uh uh-huh oh i i definitely we saw part of The African Queen on on TV a couple of years ago and i've i've always i've been wanting to see all of it but we just you know we walk into the video store and we're like well why don't we go see this now so uh yeah that was good yeah yeah yeah it's true but um i think one of the movies we saw recently we saw uh Misery oh i didn't see that one that was good um oh it was great and it you think you know for a Stephen you know it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory but there's only one well there's a couple scenes really at at the end there's there is you know some blood and everything and there's one really bad scene where it's i mean there's not blood but it's pretty graphic but it's um it's a really good movie um yeah yeah really is that the one where uh the guy gets captured by that woman okay yeah yeah yeah he's a writer and um she's his biggest fan and she's also yeah right a little a little on the nutso side uh-huh did you see Pacific Heights no we haven't um i saw that one that one wasn't that great either well i didn't think so no oh it wasn't okay i i got i heard like mixed reviews um of that we saw how about Silence of the Lambs that's that's on our list of things to see i know i i wanted to see i i was curious if you had seen it and that uh no our big thing is um you know movie movie prices up here i think it's like six bucks now in the theaters and you know so it's like you know a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape yeah that's us too yeah yeah true i know it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive yeah one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was uh Edward Scissorhands oh really yeah have you seen that oh it was great yeah it was no really i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more than adults no no it's um it's an odd film and it's really interesting that i like the director a lot um a guy named Tim Burton uh-huh did you ever see the movie Beetlejuice uh part of it i oh okay i never really watched the whole thing oh see yeah well if you if you liked Beetlejuice you'll probably like Edward Scissorhands if you didn't like Beetlejuice you'll probably won't like Edward Scissorhands oh really yeah it's um Burton's kind of uh he he he's a very odd odd man but he's i think he's very interesting and uh i liked those two movies of his a lot he did Batman also which you know uh-huh yeah that was pretty good though really it was good but i mean he was um when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies you know yeah you see it for uh you know a couple of hours or an hour and it really there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars oh yeah oh and all the different stuff like that you know yeah whose your favorite actress or actor um don't really know i like Costner a lot but uh i'm a big i'm a big baseball fan so you know after Bull Durham and Field of Dreams you know um although you know uh-huh yeah that was good i saw that movie too that was very good which one Field of Dreams yeah Field of Dreams was good um and i i think i liked the other movies he's done No Way Out was really good and did you ever see Silverado oh yeah yeah Silverado uh who who was that with um let's see Danny Glover Scott Glen Kevin Kline um Brian Dennehe Jeff Goldblum's in uh John Clease is in it if you don't blink that the name the the title sounds familiar i'm trying to think it was it was a big western i mean i think Roseanne Arquett was in it too another one that if you blink you'd miss her uh it was and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours and and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out oh really um but it was it was really good um i i might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although i would i would remember i think in with him in it uh-huh how about Revenge did you see that with him no i didn't is that any good with uh Anthony Quinn i thought it was i like everything he's done so far oh okay you know it's uh one of those movies that it's not a great movie but it was okay yeah we were in the video store today and somebody was recommending it to somebody you know the the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else yeah it was it was not a bad movie huh well i'll have to catch it one of these days you say you you said you seen No Way Out yeah that was excellent yeah that was very good um he was in The Untouchables too now that's another one i wanted to see that in fact that was advertised not too long ago he yeah it was on um it cable no it was on one of the networks i think last weekend okay i know i saw yeah something about it uh or two weeks ago yeah i um i wish i i mean i'd seen it when when you know it was originally in the theaters and um uh-huh i saw it you know i saw part of it again i mean i like you know i like Costner i like Sean Connery and uh there's this one there's this one actor it's really silly that i enjoy him a lot but i i've really enjoyed him in everything i've seen him in a guy named Charles Martin Smith i don't know him um you've probably seen him and just an you know oh that's who the guy is do you remember did you ever see American Graffiti no i i don't think so oh did you ever see the movie Star Man yes okay in Star Man he was the guy chasing after um Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen or Nancy Allen you know with short nerdy guy with glasses he's okay okay yeah yeah he's just i i don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in he was in the Untouchables he was the accountant oh oh i know who you mean he was in uh uh Honey Don't Shrink the Kids wasn't he yeah no no you're thinking of Rick Moranis he looks like Rick Moranis but he's not oh okay see all right yeah that's the one i was thinking of but i have i've seen quite a few movies i i enjoy them i think that uh it's it's kind of like uh good entertainment an uh an escape type of thing yeah yeah how about some of the ads do you go by the ads when you look at them or the reviews do they influence you a lot uh a little of a review usually won't make me go see a movie i hadn't already wanted to see yeah did you see Goodfellas no it's oh uh i want to see it that was that was pretty good um and um we want to see Godfather Part Three also but my my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago but i've never seen either of the first you know uh-huh of the of the Godfather movies so we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see Godfather Part Three somewhere i was just going to say that you should see those first uh first if you can yeah if you if you read the book it's uh even better the book was excellent oh okay i haven't yeah and uh i was a little disappointed in the third one it's Godfather Three it was not bad but i expected more i think never read it uh-huh we just rented um a couple weeks ago a movie called The Freshmen with um it's got Matthew Broderick in it and um uh Marlon Brando And Brando like does a parody of the character he played in The Godfather oh really um yeah it's it's one of the reasons why you know The Godfather's been on our minds lately um but uh there's a bunch of scenes from uh uh from The Godfather that's used because Matthew Broderick's going to film school and uh in his classes they're using there's a bunch they're running a bunch of scenes from The Godfather and then he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing you know this Mafia you know this uh organized crime head uh-huh so it's um it was it was a fun movie how about Tom Cruise do you like his stuff Cocktails or uh what i liked Rainman i thought i thought it was interesting that he was doing something oh yeah that was good i liked Rainman too yeah well i'm being from Baltimore of course i'm a big Barry Levinson fan since uh he he's you know he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies uh-huh um no i don't Barry Levinson did um Diner and Tinman and Avalon which are all set in Baltimore yeah they sound familiar i probably saw parts of those you know a lot of times i'll watch i'll start watching a movie and i'm tired and it next thing you know it's it's especially if there's commercial in it uh-huh and then the titles might sound familiar but i really don't know what they're all about yeah well yeah of the three of those Diner's probably the best i mean they're they're all pretty good but Diner is really worth seeing is that the one set in the fifties or sixties uh late fifties yeah late fifties yeah i think i saw that one okay and uh yeah how about Meryl Streep  uh i don't know i'm not a real uh great football follower i guess there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year one is the Dallas Cowboys and the other is the Oklahoma Sooners oh okay uh being a a native Okie i uh i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing uh i see so you make it uh to that Longhorns Sooners game every year no no it's funny uh i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh seventy three and uh never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since how about that but i always enjoyed watching them i just growing up in Oklahoma there it was always the home team kind of like Dallas is around here yeah yeah and there's always been an interest there well it's kind of same for me i i grew up in southern New Jersey and the local team was Philadelphia and they were like thirty miles right up the river yeah and i'm still pretty much an Eagle fan i guess i guess you keep those things you grew up with i worked in uh Missouri for a while and uh i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on TV when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals and i was rooting for the Cowboys yeah yeah but they were kind of closer to home when when i struck up with them i really don't know what's going to take place with the Cowboys this year uh everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year in a way that happened this past season and i think there's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe uh these guys are right maybe they will come through and and do something this year i look for it to be a pretty good year boy they uh they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago they did uh they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't weren't familiar with some of them turned out to be pretty good players uh some of them didn't and you know maybe the stuff that uh Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off at least we hope it will yeah i'm i keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump they make it to the play-offs it seems for the last few years but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there and you know they've got a lot of the tools to do it but doggone if they can't just put it together uh you know they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham who's just you know phenomenal but he he's too streaky it seems yeah but they have always been a really strong team yeah yeah and with without a whole lot of big name players they have got a few anchors on offense and defense and you know they they've managed with those guys and i don't know once the pressure gets turned on they they seem to loose it see that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys and and the Oklahoma Sooners it's funny over the years i guess yeah yeah i guess since Staubach left they haven't been able to keep it going yeah it's it's been a rough tow a rough road to hoe ever since he left i don't know why it's so hard to find uh a good quarterback these days yeah well that that says a lot for the for his ability though i think for Staubach's i mean you know well yeah you know he was one of the few who've come through in history that can really perform uh we hope every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through in a way Aikman has done some of that yeah but uh the guy winds up getting hurt every other game yeah i i tell you it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things you know yeah they did they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside uh it's funny watching them them play he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks uh when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best uh-huh and i haven't quite figured that out if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or uh if uh if something happens that that adrenaline starts flowing they say hey we got to do something now and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes yeah so i don't know i'm looking for for a good year i guess we're always looking for a good year so obviously though do you think they're going to do anything in the play-offs to make it to the Super Bowl this year or who do you who do you like to do that this year uh no i don't think the Cowboys have got a chance i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year and they'll get close to it they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end so who's going to beat them who are they going to blow it to uh that's a good question uh i'm figuring either one either the Eagles or possibly San Francisco i'm not real sure boy they'd some big changes speaking of them they did so i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team sometimes it brings in new motivation and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come yeah i'm sure you know my sentimental favorite would have to be Philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them Giants well that's true those guys are tough they are tough and they're big they're mean and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something yeah now that that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year i mean i wasn't pulling for either team but that was just a good football game oh yeah yeah no no and it's funny you know You like to pull for the underdog and for a long time i was pulling for Denver uh-huh uh Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes because of some of the stupid stuff he does but he's a good quarterback he's got a good arm sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard LA you mean i mean LA sorry yeah boy speaking of Denver on another subject i've been up there like five times in the last three four weeks oh yeah yeah we've trying get this new DNB two thousand printer up and running had been uh snowing up there oh boy i was just up there i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so and it was about seven inches of snow on the ground and it snowed all day wow well that will make the skiers happy oh yeah yeah if if it snowed that much in Denver you know they got that much up in the mountains you know just west of there oh you bet oh yeah up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain those guys will love that well good to talk to you yeah enjoyed it Bob you guys have a good time keep those printers coming hey we'll do it all right bye bye-bye
