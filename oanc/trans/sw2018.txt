 i actually just got back from uh U2 uh last week yes they were in Atlanta uh recently yeah they they started down in the south and then they headed up the coast how many shows did they play um they played well we saw them in Wister yes and they played once in Wister and once in Providence and then Saint Patrick's Day in Boston i see i see so you you just caught one show uh yeah um the way they rigged things where you had to call an eight hundred number and and you know two tickets two tickets per a person and yes oh i see there there where two million call attempts in in an hour to get the tickets so it was like by the time we got through there i mean we had separate seats seats but we lucked out we got a second and a third row seat really yes how about that yeah so we were we were pleased yeah yeah um uh so so um specifically um that's the sort of music you like well i mean it it's more my fiance's tastes um i go more into Celtic music um Celtic Celtic folk uh i see really that's interesting sort of new age stuff well Still I Spin and Silly Wizard uh Fair Port Convention you know kind kind of folk rocky kind of stuff but with a strong Celtic element yeah i i i see i see uh also Tangerine you know all sorts of pseudo new agey stuff Tangerine Dream and Micheal Field and and anything semi electronic yes is um so the appeal of that music is the quality you know the relaxing quality to it well i i like the harmonies and and and and the sounds of of Celtic music and i like like the uh um the uh the the uh i'm trying to remember the name of it Tin Whistle the the variety of songs tone you can get out and i find the singers tend to be better less screaming and more more uh yes melodic uh melodic and attention to phrasing and and hitting the notes rather than you know just belting them out yes i see i see uh sound you sound like you probably are down in the uh country and western belt there i yeah well uh well you see um uh down here there is a big you know there's a huge Country Western influence um particularly what i like um the Blues and uh you know various forms of um oh you know of uh um Delta Blues and uh getting back to um really elemental forms well i i find i prefer Delta Blues to like you know what a lot of people think the Blues are because i find you know kind of the more the the more uh conventional as where blues i i find kind of repetitive and unmelodic well it um you know i can see that argument but and as far as the emotion and the feeling that comes out you know even though it might be repetitive um um-hum the the emotion that comes out of it i really think is a lot of it you know it you know where as the quality of the Celtic music seems appealing the raw power and you know whether um um-hum yeah well it it's a very it's a very minimalist form because you've got duh duh duh duh or something like that you've got a very simple base line with uh yeah uh uh just a one four five progression over and over again yeah right yeah i think i was singing like my dog yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i i think with that the quality kind of it it's much more based on you know how much the person can impart i mean i've heard some Blues that it's like you you know did not strike me as as anything special because it's like yeah okay you know life's been tough to me too and you know there's just so much you can hear of that right so uh so so perhaps the connection with it wasn't there uh yeah i i mean you know well i've heard some Blues i really liked where they're imparting more than just you know i'm yet another guy who got treated bad yes yes i'm trying to think whether there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on the actual message being imparted it it certainly certainly you're not listening to it for its lifting melodies right right right right um i also like Jazz and um you know how do you think the two um you know complement each other do do right well uh Jazz is is a much more i i i think you've got to be a much more uh spontaneous person to be playing Jazz you know you've got a long time to think about that next verse in uh Blues yes right where as in Jazz you know it just is is moving and um and create a flowing in different directions right i mean and you've got to be very i mean in many ways Jazz and Celtic if you ever go to like a yes um it's very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh uh you know just a a jam session Jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if you're playing a reel or a jig you know that's the basic melody of the jig but people are just going off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played uh-huh uh uh never played together and uh never there uh apparently in the Celtic is there any set form that um right um there is to some extent i mean you know there's the basic tune of the jig or the real yes but you know someone will just come in and you know who's going to who's going to you know take lead on this verse who's going to you know it you know i want to uh there's a group called which is an Irish  well Allen do you think that uh all our politicians are totally dishonest or are they just making mistakes like their uh banking business i think some of them are dishonest and some of them are probably honest mistakes it's hard to me to imagine that somebody's going to overwrite uh what what was the largest amount of checks and write out a check for five thousand dollars and not know they're overdrawing their account yeah but on the other hand somebody you know making a couple of overdrawing checks probably isn't a major phenomena i think they're under a lot of pressure especially when there's money involved and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time oh i think so too and i think that's just about the only thing you can do to to clean up government or clean up the political side of government is to kick the bums out periodically limit the terms well that bothers me because again we ought to have a government where we can choose who we want and when you you know limit terms and you say well even if people want this person they can't have them which is kind of a hard situation too yeah but but the longer they stay i'm and i'm assuming we're just talking about Washington politicians i don't know that much about the state government i figure it's pretty rotten too i mean even the city council's are a little weird if you look at Dallas or a lot weird yeah but but have you been to Washington yes have have you watched those folks in action i mean i visited the House and the Senate and sat there in the gallery and watched those folks up there pontificating to a room of no one yeah and and it it their their posturing their i don't know i it it's like their not in the real world or something and maybe that's why they have have trouble drawing lines as to what's illegal and what's not well i mean the other problem is is that they're always up for reelection sure so that they're always not making the right decision but the politically correct decision yeah and it it i think that's hard for them plus when you you put the lobbyist back there i wish somehow we could limit lobbyist well i think that's a greater problem because they're constantly trying to use their influence in not always the most positive ways yes that's true i i think they do things that make it easier for our elected representatives to have to live the good life yeah i mean if you if you just look at at what goes on in Washington those folks don't live the same way i do anyway no it's almost that they're royalty of some sort and i think that's why they forget sometimes that laws apply to them too uh seems to me somehow if they could draw a straight salary and not have any other benefits and you know i don't know what the salary ought to be but i think that would decrease somewhat the the need for the kinds of things that sometimes happen yeah but aren't they making something like a hundred and ten thousand a year well i was shocked i was happened to be reading the voters guide in the last election and a Senator a a a Representative makes a hundred and twenty nine thousand dollars a year which kind of blew my mind yes yes i'd like to make that much that's more uh that's a lot more than i make huh huh well run for office uh no thanks yeah they i i what gets me is when they pass laws and they always manage to exempt themselves from them or raise they give themselves raises when they're trying to cut government expenses oh yes but i mean is it no wonder that there's not a balanced budget when they can't even handle their own checking accounts yeah i don't know and the other problem is you know one of the other questions it asked is is is there someway we can make all unethical things illegal and i'm just convinced you can't legislate common sense no probably not and that seems to be something that a lot of them are missing that's right i they get caught up i think in the the glamour and the power and whatnot and probably make bad decisions bad choices sometimes and i think part of the other problem is is because government has such a bad reputation people who might really do well in it tend to avoid it because of all the negative uh feelings about politicians you may have some people who could be do a really good job but they just kind of stay out of it because they don't want to be associated with that kind of thing that's true that's true i wonder i wonder if Ross Perot would get elected how he would behave i don't know little nervous about that one too i i think he's an honest person yeah i think he definitely is i don't uh and he and he certainly has no need to have his hands in anybody else's pockets i'm just wondering how he would cope with the fact that he can't just do you know sort of looking at the as an outsider at the way he ran his company you either did what he said or you were out and i'm not sure as a President you could ever run it that  okay i guess they're okay so uh you go first yeah okay um i guess i um haven't really thought about it for a while i guess um the uh job part of the one i have now there is a requirement that kind of came in after the fact that does since they have contracts one of their uh companies they contract with required it and uh you know by then it was it was kind of uh um you know they didn't explain up front that that might be a requirement but it sounded like it was kind of sprung on them by the uh firms they had contracts with uh-huh uh but it's it's not something i think is appropriate i guess there might be exceptions you know if if you're in a critical position like you're a traffic controller or something like that um-hum but um it should it it seems like uh i guess the employer uh is just i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into uh kind of your personal life right yeah that that that's how i feel i feel the um the employee um the employer has concern about you know what's going on in my body to the degree that it affects how i am doing my job and uh-huh um there are lots of factors that affect how i do my job i i don't personally take any drugs but you know that's one factor that could affect something an employee's performance right uh-huh there are plenty of other factors like i know for me how much sleep i got you know what i ate for breakfast those things have a lot big impact on how i perform during the day yeah and unless they're they want to get involved in all these other areas also you know like maybe providing healthy meals healthy breakfast for employees or something like that you know i mean i i uh-huh uh that's you know that's one step and it what it is what they're getting into is the drug testing is a real quick and easy way and politically um feasible way of going about this because you know everybody is going to be against drugs you know well just about everybody is against drug use so let's test everybody for it um but the thing is it's not it's not my company's business what i do on the weekends or in in the evenings you know if i show up for work hungover right then they've got something to say you know so hungover to the extent that i'm not able to do my job well right yeah i know think most impairments would be obvious fairly obvious you know but yeah yeah but on the other hand if i go out and have fifteen thousand beers but then i'm fine the next morning it's none of their business right you know what i do with myself or if if i smoke fifteen joints or something and i hit or whatever um um-hum and that's how i feel about it uh things drug testing for uh marijuana i guess can detect use uh or actually they can do tests with um with hair samples of hair and finger nails uh that can test or detect use like months and months and months previous wow you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair yeah um also especially it's unfair when the companies don't offer some sort of treatment program also it you know it's like oh we find you with drugs so huh you're gone yeah get out of here um luckily my company is doesn't uh do any of that sort of thing they they were talking about doing the policy of testing new people new employees as they come in but not anything it it wouldn't be random it would be everybody um um-hum and it wouldn't be current employees it would only be new employees um but i you know i yeah seems like it's a sneaky way to introduce it because eventually you know then everybody would yeah yeah done it and they they right yeah it it'll be you know the climate would be different then yeah and i i you know i don't think the companies have any cause to do that sort of thing unless there's you know reasonable suspicion you know if you come in obvious glassy eyed everyday from lunch or something it's okay somebody's been smoking some pot here uh-huh then do a drug test if you have some reasonable suspicion but it's right you know there there there's so many things i mean if if i were going through a divorce for instance which is something a lot of people experience that would really negatively affect my performance yeah you know are they going to require that i stay married or that i require me to some how have a perfect marriage or something well then you know that doesn't make sense uh-huh yeah so it's yeah it just seems like it's a intrusion i mean the the only angle they might have is if um yeah i guess if they're paying the insurance premium or something like that then it you know uh-huh uh-huh it might be that they the carrier the carrier they're using has a has higher rates or something like that so there's there's probably an economic argument right well in in in in that case charge the employees extra  well um as far as the as far as spending goes the way um the way i see it in the in the last article i read was that i think US ought to spend the same amount of money that we're spending but i think the states need to take advantage of it more than they are because i know the article i read stated that Texas had um what was it like eleven million not a million but like a hundred and ten thousand um-hum offered to it or more than that and it didn't take advantage of all the money that it was offered um-hum because the state that i'm in has is the fourth largest in AIDS cases and it's just not taking advantage of the money that's being provided i wasn't aware that there was a very large uh gay community in Texas well there's well well we have we have our own you know that we have i guess a fair share um and it's it's spreading outside of of the homosexual community interesting yeah and Atlanta is sort of the homosexual capital of the Southeast so we have quite a few cases here and of course we here a lot about it because the Centers for Disease Control is located here uh-huh uh my feeling on the funding issue is uh uh proportion in proportion to the number of people who are dying of AIDS uh compared to uh other diseases like cancer and heart disease um-hum um-hum um-hum we're spending many many times more on AIDS research than we are for these other diseases um-hum and i think a lot of it's just due to political clout and pressure well also because it's so new yeah and cancer and cancer and such doesn't spread as readily to other people as it does as AIDS does that well yes that's true but also uh we haven't learned enough about cancer to be able to prevent it but it many ways AIDS is completely preventable through uh behavioral changes um-hum um-hum i do think that uh part of the reason that we haven't made as much progress in AIDS research and the reason we're spending so much money on it is that it's almost all of the research is in the hands of the government and we all know how efficient the government is uh the way i look at it is if uh if all the internal bickering between in Center for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health health uh over who's going to get credit for solving it were to be set aside um-hum um-hum and if private industry just through the profit motive more than anything else were set loose to go off and find uh a cure with the promise that they'd be able to get the financial rewards from it uh i feel that we'd find a cure really quick um-hum um-hum uh but as it is it's just being the whole program is just being mismanaged by bureaucrats uh and it's real disappointing uh you know so many of the other uh major advances that we have today are are done by private industry but for some reason in this case no one's really willing to give them a chance that's true i hadn't i hadn't thought about that uh course you know i'm a big advocate of the free market anyway and uh it seems to me that so much of what the government gets involved in just just goes to pot uh but uh i uh i do want there to be a cure um-hum uh uh but like so many other things i think the way just the way that we're going about it is not the best way well um i i think a lot of a lot i mean this is a this is a a an a totally new experience we haven't come really ever come across at least not in my like time that you know where we've come across a disease that has spread this rapidly um and that we've you know is is changing i know just in the last three months the CDC has come back and redefined AIDS sure you know and so i mean it's it's very difficult to put a cure on something that you keep expanding and we keep you know and all the new um you know things that we keep finding you know that you can be HIV positive for you know now what have they bumped it up to eleven years now uh it's a long time yeah you know and it's interesting that there are there do seem to be a lot of people who are HIV positive but who never get the disease um-hum and it seems to me that it's it's likely that there's some other uh it's not just the virus that causes it but it's something else in your body that the virus triggers uh that causes it and if they can find whatever that other that other trigger um-hum  well um i guess the first question is uh what um what do do you have any children at all to begin with well i work with children um i don't have any right now uh myself um but we definitely do want to have um children and i work in the medical field so i work with children during the day quite a bit pediatrics um well i have worked in family practice which in large part was pediatrics i so i'm well aware of child care problems and needs oh are you um what are you a nurse are you a doctor uh i'm a physician assistant is an attendant a physicians assistant um-hum i see so have you ever heard of that i've no well i mean there's all kinds of things i haven't heard of so i i haven't heard of that no not particularly what what do you do exactly hum um well we're train to diagnose and prescribe and um in some states anyway their prescribing laws are different and yeah in the particular job that i recently left um i was functioning as a family practitioner and just seeing patients of all varieties whatever you'd see in normal family practice pretty much what i did and i saw kids a lot they liked to see me because i wasn't an intimidating man doctor i guess um-hum hum hum so they appreciated that oh boy but so do you have children no i do not none that i'm aware of anyway as they say um no i uh no i do not have have any children i'm very i'm mostly happily single hm none that you're aware well that's our topic right uh yeah i i it is i i um uh i don't know i have i have my own opinions on the on the subject it's kind of for me this particular question is is is uh reminiscent of uh answer yes or no have you stopped beating your wife uh um it pre supposes something that isn't necessarily that isn't necessarily true first of all that you think that child care should be done by other people besides the people having the kids um-hum but um i'm i'm a little like i don't know i've i've got my own views on that i well what are your views well uh you can tell me i've doesn't matter if i agree or not oh hey there you go um i don't know i i tend to think that child care is kind of overused i think there's a kind of what kind of overused in a sense it's the idea is that you can have a two income family and nothing is going to be changed you know the idea of quality time over over quantity of time spent with kids which i think is nonsense um-hum yeah that's the reason one of the reasons i think that schools are doing so badly is so many people look at them as a just a just a tax payer financed babysitting service um-hum you know but anyway that's just me well i agree with you there i i guess um i i suppose you know you could call me a career woman but i i do feel that i want to be at home with my kids mainly because i see that as such an important thing um that also i know of what a job takes out of me and i wouldn't have anything left over for my kids and i wouldn't want to do that to myself you know yeah i mean these are human beings that we're trying to raise and help them be constructive members of society there's a good phrase so so i i'm with you there on the other hand i have a lot friends who are mothers and work full time in their careers and i wouldn't you know i their kids are darling too and i i would hate to give them the impression that i judge am judging them um-hum yeah oh yeah i i understand that yeah but on the other hand there some that are sacrificing their kids for the sake of their jobs and you know i'm sure their kids would be much better served if if somebody would at least i don't know it's it's rough and i think that there's a yeah well there a giving an example my girlfriend's uh sister um-hum is um marry married a uh married a uh psychologist and where they're living he they can they can afford for her not to work um-hum which she has not been doing since they since they've had uh children and especially i i think it would be ultimate really impossible because she just had twins not very long ago oh and uh yeah there's no way and uh they you know they tell me that there's they get together and  i work for one of the defense contractors out here actually it's it's not a defense contractor it's uh a federally funded research and development center uh-huh kind of like the Mitre Corporation only uh uh we work mainly with the Air Force in terms of satellites alright and um so um in other words your your bread and butter comes from the federal government the the government yes uh right so your your uh your life sort of follows it's flow that's correct so um how are the benefits set up are they set up like they are in the federal government or are they uh actually no um it turns out that uh we are a non profit organization so the the benefits are different um uh-huh i mean basically you get you know the the health care coverage uh one of the big pluses for this company was you would get um three weeks of vacation to start normally in California when you work for one of the defense contractors they give you three weeks to start but all of the companies shut down between Christmas and New Year's so you end up in essence only getting two weeks of voluntary vacation and one week of involuntary vacation is you want to look at it that way sure i see what you're saying uh where as in our uh for our company they did not have until very recently a plant shutdown between Christmas and New Year's uh the idea is that you've got the three weeks and you can take it whenever you want it um-hum so that was a big plus benefit for this company and that's just recently been taken away from you uh well the past couple of years because of uh cut backs and and whatnot they uh basically have put down and told people that you either take a week of vacation between Christmas and New Year's or take a week of no pay um uh the it's up to you you have the choice and so the the company does shut down between Christmas and New Year's i don't believe that this is a long term solution that they're going to use but uh they have been doing it for the past couple of years and they may do it for a year or two more development yeah well um you say now you say you get your health benefits is this a one hundred percent coverage uh uh-huh no i don't think any of unless of course you go with an HMO yeah uh the thing is that they also do not have uh eye glass coverage so if you need eye glasses you're on your own uh they also do not provide uh well they do provide dental if you go with an HMO though you lose the um the choose choice of doctors if you take their you know they have one of these cafeteria plans so you you either choose the HMO or you choose the ability to choose um-hum um i guess blue cross and blue shield is who they have now and the idea there is that if you go with one of their associated doctors they'll pay eighty percent if you go with a non associated doctor they pay seventy percent um-hum um-hum so that that i have to admit i mean when i first started out you were covered completely and it was not a um an HMO type of thing i i when i first started out in engineering i worked for RCA back in the mid seventies and uh they just covered everything um-hum sure but uh you know i've watched this slowly erode erode erode until the point where now um i figure that the next thing is going to be uh you're going to have to pay big bucks and they're only going to pay cover certain certain uh diseases well that's it certainly looks the way things are headed right now if uh something isn't done at the i guess at the federal level or right yeah or something i don't know about this but it's uh i um worked for a number of years as support staff in law law firms in the Washington Area uh-huh and i kind of had exactly the same experience uh law the especially during the seventies and eighties law firms were just rolling in the money um-hum and uh it's a little bit less that way now the recession has even hurt a lot of the big law firms in this area but um uh-huh the result uh was during that period that not only did we get one hundred percent benefits in terms of health care and so forth but they were rather extravagant plans that we were party to with with uh full dental and huh uh you know optical stuff stuff for our eyes and uh and so forth and i have to confess i had a couple of real bad health scares during that time and found that it really came in handy the HMO idea uh-huh right wow appeared on the scene i guess in the mid eighties and i tried a couple of them out uh and in fact have eventually settled on one of them i've change jobs now but this the same HMO is still available in my current position and and um hum it's it's uh i the interesting thing they've done some interesting things with the HMO's in this area where you there are a number of doctors and you can choose amongst the doctors that are available in fact uh one of them that's run by Prudential has essentially signed up a bunch of private physicians in the the Washington Area  so what do you think of the current jury system oh i think basically it works okay the uh i do think that we need to have unanimous verdicts although that can certainly cause problems sometimes yeah definite definitely you want the benefit of the doubt and as much on the defendant's side as possible yeah absolutely make sure you're not getting into a police state or anything close to it right absolutely the uh i think that when they have unanimous verdicts in some civil trials i think that's okay but uh i'm not sure if they said we're supposed to just talk about civil or criminal or both uh it just said trial by jury it didn't say either okay well for civil i think a i think in a lot of cases in civil trials you can have a i think ten to two is acceptable yeah i i think there's a lot more shades of gray that are possible and acceptable in civil trials than in criminal trials criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didn't it happened where in the civil trial there's a more wider range of you know whether this contract was satisfied fully satisfied partly satisfied or so on right yeah there's a lot more variation there it's not just did they do it or didn't they do it it's so i don't quite like the idea of the in civil trials in sounds like in a lot places the jury comes up with what the award amount should be i think you really want another party you know the the jury just say this is the things we think money should be awarded for and then either the judge or a three judge tribunal coming up with what the award amount should be i agree and i agree that the jury in those kinds of civil trials can even apportion the liability if it's a liability type of thing yeah that it's forty percent this guy sixty the other or whatever but uh in civil trials juries have come up with some really ridiculous awards right that get overturned or changed on the first appeal right where as if they came up with a more reasonable one the first time through maybe you wouldn't need to tie up the system with all these appeals right i agree and i think that uh certainly were i in a paralyzed or something i'd want eighty three zillion dollars but uh i think rationally eighty three million dollars or something is probably acceptive because i think what i'd really want would be someone to you know the money to take care of me for the rest of my life yeah well the the the wish that i had proper care and medical treatment but giving me an extra million and millions of dollars that i couldn't do a damn thing with anyway right and uh wouldn't really help anybody except the lawyers who'd get their cut of it their half and i also think yeah on the same lines the uh punitive damage awards should really go more towards let's say the government and supporting the court system there's no reason an individual person should get the punitive damages i think that's more of right you know it it's something that doesn't really you know the person is already being compensated for his losses and injuries yeah the punitive damages are more of a slap on the wrist of the person doing or the corporation doing the injury and having that go to the person who does the suing doesn't quite make sense right also punitive damages in general i mean if there's if i'm hurt in a car accident and there's punitive damages of five million dollars against you i'd probably never collect it right and if it's because your car was bad and it's five million dollars against General Motors that's probably small change to them and it's not really punitive against either one because General Motors five million is nothing and to you since it's uncollectable it doesn't make much difference anyway no i think five million dollars would definitely cut into the executive bonuses of GM uh i don't know it's a good question i guess it's off the topic we're supposed to be discussing but yes yes the uh and the other thing i guess that was in there was whether the you know the other thing i guess on the topic that i'd bring up is um the insanity defensives i don't never quite liked that temporary insanity well i like what some states have including Colorado and Idaho the wording is something like on the insanity it's instead of not guilty because you're insane so they send you to the mental hospital it's guilty and insane something like right  drug testing hey yeah um my opinion uh is not quite well enough formulated for for real debate but above all i really really believe that uh first of all people are innocent until proven guilty and secondly that there in some sense there's a sort of sanctity of the body issue in that i don't really believe that other people would have the right for someone to under go a blood test without their explicit consent so i think that pretty much clearly leads me to my conviction conviction that i i do not believe that uh spot drug tests or required drug tests should be should be you know mandated however they could be done with the person's consent i'm a little bit more uh against it than that because i see this as an absolute parallel to the McCarthy witch hunts when anybody who held um liberal opinions or supported civil rights was considered an evil satanic agent of Moscow quite often i mean there's the legitimate concern of people who are too stupid not to use chemicals that impair can impair their behavior in a job right where they better be on top of things like running trains flying planes or uh driving buses and also uh the uh strictures against driving uh unimpaired while impaired should apply to any chemical of any kind whether the government has authorized the use of that chemical or not okay well i maybe i should qualify mine and and mention of course there are some legal parameters that need to be observed as well and uh in the case of driving it's not a it it's a privilege to drive and there's certain things that go along with it but even then they don't force you to take any kind of test if you simply don't take the test then you just you know and they take your license on the assumption that you're guilty which makes sense but this is not the issue here yeah right in that case because it clearly clearly endangers someone in that case it's not the issue in question though because what the government is trying to do is to truly impose thought control they are saying there are things you cannot do to your mind and body because we have not authorized to do it and further more if we think that you are uh we're going to make sure that you can't get a job or that you'll be fired from your job if you are engaging in this behavior now blood tests aren't really being called for what they're doing is calling for piss tests which technically it's leaving your body but whatever it is they shouldn't even have the right to ask um-hum they shouldn't have the right to prohibit these chemicals what they should have the right to prohibit is misuse of anything oh i see you're you're a much more baser at at at the issue of uh of the drug issue than i am apparently uh yeah i think that it's just a witch hunt and that the people being hit the hardest are the ones that cause the least impact something like eighty percent of the tests and the positive tests and the arrests contain concern marijuana the only commonly used drug that has no traceable deaths from overuse none even aspirin kills thirty two people a year and if by all standards that can be compared potential for abuse uh general impact on society physical impact on the individual this drug should not be outlawed but the right wing does not want to hear talk like that and so on top of that goes the whole Republican drug testing uh intervention and control of your body attitude an interesting side note of this is the Motorola company lost eighteen months of development on the oh four oh chip because they instituted drug testing and the entire development team for that chip left the company ah wow and that's why it took this long for the oh four oh to get out they scuttled their own boat and cost themselves millions of dollars for that well uh as as far as i i'm not sure you you sort of seem to be kind of saying that you have the right to uh pursue any kind of substance that you'd like except for in certain circumstances like driving is that what you're trying to say i'd say it's pretty much it's uh right to privacy the individual can do whatever they want as long as they don't negatively impact other individuals it is then that negative impact that should be looked at not the uh not the direct cause of it it's under those grounds that we don't have alcohol prohibition or tobacco prohibition right well not having alcohol tobacco prohibition and and uh tobacco prohibition uh i think those are more historical artifact of uh the link between the business and the government though because there yeah that's true too especially with tobacco yeah and alcohol they did try to ban it they failed utterly they failed miserably and led to the creation of the modern day mafia well hey they were successful and that's pretty much what's happen that's pretty much what's happened with other with the the current prohibition well i'm i guess we should get back to to the the drug testing issue to tell yeah that we are getting a stray yeah um well i'm trying to think of of more coherent thought it's kind of difficult to have a debate  why what would you tell someone well i think first thing is they need to talk with their child to their child talk to their child and find exactly what they want to do why are they're going why are they going to college instead of doing something else um-hum once you find out why they want to go to college then you can get a better idea of uh what range of colleges they should go to uh-huh uh obviously if they want to learn trade skills you wouldn't send them to an academic center and vice versa uh-huh and um beyond that i think you need to consider the uh range of expenses of going to college that would probably narrow your ranges down even further um-hum and if you want to go something beyond what you can afford then you need to start investigating scholarship and other things um-hum so i think you start out with something broad like that and then narrow your range as you you know as you find out more about the child and what the their uh needs are and what they want to do how about you well i guess i would agree somewhat i mean in terms of finding out first why they want to go to college if they do want to go to college a lot of times it's the parents who want them to go to college rather than themselves that does happen yes um but uh i think it's probably the the studies have been done looking at uh how well you are and what you do when you end up whether or not you uh have a degree or not uh makes a big difference later on in your life and um you know it'd be good to even to start as early as possible to understand what what you child would desire um-hum and and determine a goal some point uh before like the last moment well and but you know you never know they always a lot of people go to college because they don't know what else is better to do it seems like it's my experience but uh i guess that once they've decided they wanted to go to college i think that's that's also that's something uh important but uh you know have them go through the i guess they have like the Barron's books and various other books that describes all the different colleges that they are in terms of competitiveness and things like that um-hum and they could also narrow it down that way other than just the economic things though it's probably more so now than used to be um but people you know you want to try to match their needs as best they can and then if you know you could always shoot for those places that don't have you know are that might be considered out of your range but sometimes you might be able to get a scholarship or whatever have you so i wouldn't rule them out on the first cut uh i would try to get them to to find the colleges they think that are you know best fit their needs in terms of the size the college the kinds of course offerings the reputation they have in those areas um you know whether a child wants to be closer or away how far away they want to be from home there's a lot of different other aspects to it you know that does enter into it all yeah and uh i think there's things like student uh faculty ratios and and uh all that kind of stuff how well endowed the school is sometimes you that's important because if it's not well endowed school uh then a you know a lot of times they're just they uh the schools go from year to year based on just the enrollment and uh if that's what the school's doing then um it may not be around the following year especially these times yes you know they're not as economically sound right well i have a a daughter now who is a junior who is looking at colleges and uh um-hum it's interesting uh there were a lot more choices years ago when i went to college um-hum and uh she is is going through the process much like what you're you know you've described and i've described described so how far away do they want to go what do they want to do how important is whether it's a private or a public school what are the chances for scholarships and uh a lot of mid range smaller schools that are actually easier to get into if you have pretty good grades of course it's not quite so comparative to say the Ivy League schools oh yeah uh-huh and um yeah they also tend not to be as well endowed and they also have lots of other uh good and bad points sometimes the offerings that they have is better than um-hum you know some of the Ivy schools that's for sure uh but there's also other problems too um you know they tend to they all admit all sorts of people  topic today there's a sound like a panel topic we're talking about uh what we can do to make uh make uh our government get a little more for it's money in other words short and long long-term goals yeah short long-term goals to be able to get a better value out of what we already pay uh-huh and i wanted to say something to you about Ross Perot are you familiar with the man uh i've i've watched him yes he's he's i've been told that that he uh well his ideologies won't work because he's too much of an authoritarian yeah but he does raise some interesting points like he does i i i from just his speaking i i i hear a a very a strong tinge of integrity uh-huh the uh the the question he raised in my mind was uh he was speaking in front of the National Press Club the other day and he said let's think of some wild and crazy things to do to wipe out the four hundred billion dollar deficit that we've got uh-huh um remember we're thinking about wild and crazy things we'll throw anything out he said um let's say we take all the profits of the fortune five hundred uh-huh for a year um-hum not enough money only half as much as we need um-hum so another words four hundred billion dollars is hell of a lot of money right uh and that's just he deficit just this year um-hum there's apparently a hundred and eighty billion dollars that the president's own controller will tell you is fault and mismanagement um-hum i think that would be the short-term goals um-hum get rid of the fraud and mismanagement um-hum um apparently they have plenty of time the boards right now for computer systems and other tracking methods to get rid of the fraud and everyone says well it's going to cost a billion dollars to implement this well a billion stacked against a hundred and eighty billion sounds like a good investment to me but are we what do you think are we talking about the the mechanical element you might say or are we talking about the human element i think it's the human element it's a human element but the mechanical element of it can i mean mechanical meaning a computer could help exactly yes could help track oh sure uh and and find out what's going on you know statistical cross-referencing and and uh you know the the pork barrel and all that other stuff that they uh you know um-hum they do to keep in office to stay in office uh i think term limitations are a viable a viable way to cut the amount of money we spend in government um-hum um if uh you know we we say the president can be limited to two terms and we don't limit um-hum um-hum congress critters at all i think Dave i think one of the another thing is that we have such a great disparity between the consumer and the businesses and that all reflects into the budget also uh-huh we we the American people don't have faith in the government and they don't have faith in business yeah especially now after this rubber gate thing you know they uh it's something that everyone can identify with and exactly and uh if they can't even balance their own check book how in the worlds are they going to balance a trillion plus dollar budget well then you have you have President Bush going over to Japan to try to do some wrangling over there to for the trade deficit and they send the send the top executive from GM and they're they're making four and five times they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year um oh that GM is trying to market their products and is that that's another way is that the consumers just don't trust big business they just don't there's so right there you have an element of of the political government you have an element of big business and you have the consumer watching and they're just going what's this um-hum yeah i think um it's uh i've been studying some libertarian views uh-huh and i've been thinking more and more that maybe we need to get government out of out of business and away from business and out of everybody's hair you know i i i mean i agree with you to a certain extent but the problem is with democracy with you know our capitalistic government um-hum the almighty dollar doesn't have any ethical code with it um-hum and i it's just like how you know what would you do the Exxon Valdez you see what what are we just just say are we taking government out of it we need those controls because the in the our capitalistic society it's just those controls it's just it's the business it starts going and if they can its its the dollar that that dictates and if they can find someplace to dump something or their pollution and we're polluting something unfortunately well  go ahead oh okay yeah the uh subject is child care and how to determine child care and that's uh an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children but i did run a child care facility for a while hm and uh have some well you should've you should have some opinions on that then i do have some thoughts on that yeah and it's uh an interesting experience to be a surrogate parent for or a parent for a lot of people there and um it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities well i guess if i were going to choose i mean my first consideration would be safety right my second consideration would be uh um health right and uh i guess my third consideration would be uh warm environment warm personal environment well right um in Texas we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate on a at an institutional level and at a like a small home level so you meet the standards but then after that there's there's a lot more i think it's important as the safety and health and that kind of stuff is qualification of people who work there and in hiring people who would work at the uh day care the child care facility was very difficult to find qualified people um in terms of not just just because somebody has a child or uh likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training that oh absolutely as a matter of fact i believe that the safety and and health uh issues uh depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children that uh exactly and that was the most difficult thing of all to find the the right people the qualified people and it's the most difficult thing of all for a parent judge uh because a person can be very nice and warm and loving but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children and be aware of what the safety hazards are oh oh exactly and the other thing that's difficult in uh an institutional setting like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child because you don't wanna just warehouse the child and i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four or five years are so important and you have to have the right kind of enrichment and that that includes uh an atmosphere in which the child is safe and and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for but also his uh developmental needs are cared for too maybe the right thing to do is to um when a couple has a child then they should both take you say the first four or five years are the most important and i think i would agree with that they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting that would be lovely get rid of all these child care centers at least for young kids below the age of six um-hum and then um and then of course to make up for that um the uh parents would have to work in their later years longer in in other words they probably would not work may not end may end up not working at all in the twenties oh well that's an interesting thought because but they may have to work from age thirty or or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety that would be okay that would that would help on the other end too in in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be right well you know the uh uh the world is changing from uh uh uh uh from institutional from uh industrial uh base to uh information base and so what that means is you don't have to be physically powerful to work um-hum that's exactly right all you have to do is have a sharp mind and i believe that uh mental acuity is easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind oh so i think a person could work uh into the seventies eighties even nineties for that matter if they didn't have to do a lot of physical uh labor they could maintain maintain uh a  what kind of music you into well i have a uh pretty wide taste uh in music ranging from progressive rock to jazz to uh lot of different forms of uh music in fact it's easier for me to say uh the types of music that i don't like are opera and uh screaming heavy metal the opera yeah it's right on track i like classical but i can't deal with opera at all i've and heavy metal uh it's noisy i'm into uh some industrial music that's a a bit even harder than that but it's it's got to have a point to it uh-huh oh i don't mind music that's difficult to listen to but uh the the uh basic point of heavy metal which which seems to be music to annoy you is uh gets a little annoying yeah what kind of progressive stuff oh lot of stuff that actually has uh ended up becoming popular like uh Nirvana and uh oh you know i'm thirty so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the Clash and and the Sex Pistols and REM uh that sort of stuff uh REM makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being uh you know ultra mainstream at this point and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed oh yeah yeah it's a lot of people like like saying that you know bands in that position you know sold out i think that's pretty much you know bull uh-huh because REM really hasn't changed it's it's it's interesting they're producing uh similar music and it's good music but you know people have picked up on it uh-huh that's good i'm impressed i think it is uh for a while there music seemed to really have popular music seemed to have uh not a lot of point to it i was really tired of uh the Michael Bolton Michael Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes oh yeah and i could uh go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money uh but he picked the right songs and i guess and that that's about all he had going for him or still has for that matter that that and a marvelous hairdo oh yeah yeah i'm sure that that sold that sold a lot for him that's all you really need for a lot of lot of pop i'm kind i've kind of like developed a a short hatred for for pop it just seems like there's no no real point you hear the same same tune over and over again in a thousand guises and uh-huh well it's it's interesting because you were you were saying that you liked classical music uh-huh and i like a lot of classical music but i also dislike uh some classical music and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music and feel that if if it's not seventy five years old it hasn't stood the test of time yeah i can i can believe that what kind of things are you do you like in classical what's the standard uh stuff that i like uh i like Bach i tolerate Vivaldi i can't stand uh uh Debussy or Debussy uh uh i like Tchaikovsky he can make a lot of noise when he's uh so inclined uh and some of some oh yes stuff that i like uh for instance Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition uh-huh and that's interesting music but it would not get performed by any uh municipally funded uh philharmonic uh just because number one it's Frank Zappa and he's weird number two isn't he still alive you know we're we're much better off playing uh Beethoven's ninth that's right you know we'll we'll do we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and and hum it it's safe and it it it just isn't chance taking enough for me uh i feel that uh that that music should take chances in one way or another and that uh you know if you've heard a piece oh a hundred a hundred times  well i guess uh start off by saying that i am very much in favor of space travel but i think we're going about it all wrong okay with that what are your thoughts uh i'd like you to expound on that a little bit but uh i am very much in favor of it too and i think that we need to take the approach that so much technology is advanced out of the uh space program that it's amazing to me that we don't put more money into it um yeah well i am uh kind of disappointed by the way things have been going uh basically we've been out this at this for what about thirty five years uh well yeah well it depends on what you're saying yeah that i guess from the first experimental well first experimental vanguard type stuff uh i think that was called the first uh the modified B twos and things like that um-hum okay that was late fifties i believe so yeah and um if you look at the progress that was made at the turn of the century in aviation in a period of thirty five years um-hum in my assessment it was spectacularly better well there's no doubt about that and um i don't think that's because the complexity of the task i think that's because it's being handled by bureaucracy now well you so you're saying you thought uh that well that that implies to me that you would you should've felt like it should've been uh turned over to a commercial market well i'm excited about these fellows who are experimenting commercially i'm excited about uh the commercial end of satellite operations um there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there and uh well i think that uh satellites now that is a that is a market where there's a a valid reason for commercial uh when it comes to research i'm not sure i agree with that well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research oh no reasons i just don't think that uh a commercial organization could successfully uh uh make it profitable for them uh i mean and besides the fact it it also would be extremely limiting as to which research it'd be be whichever one happened to bring in the dollar well they have some organizations out there with some fairly deep pockets and uh i think that but US is notorious for not spending any money on research uh our commercial market uh our commercial percentages are much lower than uh most most of the other major countries as compared to Japan compared to Germany compared to uh most of the Scandinavian countries yeah well maybe the amount of money uh put towards research is is minuscule and had minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years that so i'm not so sure that that would be well you go ahead i i i agree that the bureaucracy in most cases is something which it should be avoided and we have we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it and it seeps over in a lot of different ways um now uh in space i don't think you could do it any other way uh well i'd say fact my opinion is what we ought to do is we ought to get all these all the countries involved in these things and in fact um go ahead oh well because i mean we have um resources across the world i mean i i we're coming out to a global global economy anyways um-hum so why aren't we using the Japanese technology why aren't we using the European technology why aren't see well see space travel is a world issue it's not a US issue and and our our our kind of elitism attitude we had in the sixties about US uh love it or leave it and you know actually we still have it but that whole it's not as effective now as it was then right um that the the the concept of beating the other uh countries i think is somewhat it may be obsolete yeah it's somewhat obsolete and i think yeah yeah you know i uh what do you call it um i think it's important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and that by that i mean you know i don't know about i'm not going to speculate about research across the board but let's suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research right and you're three or four competitors and you're debating whether to um throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years um-hum but it's going to be a real long term uh play or whether you're just going to sit back and watch television and um when you look when you see that your primary competitor is um a government with very deep pockets that's going to give the fruits to your competitors the obvious correct decision is to sit back and wait for them to give it to everybody rather than doing it yourself so i think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount of uh private uh effort put into it uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon it's going to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag i would say that i have absolutely no  well we every we used to when i was younger we used to go every weekend but we hadn't done much a lot whole lot of it lately yeah all right yeah i'm kind of into it i'm uh kind of a sailor i'm up in Minneapolis now but i was in Florida so uh yeah i was kind of getting to it for a while there yeah were you sailboating yeah for the most part yeah i had a little sailboat yeah well we don't get do a whole lot of that up here no just motorboat's all we what part of Texas you from uh Nacogdoches okay whereabouts is that that's between Houston and Dallas okay all right it's the oldest town in Texas yeah we have uh Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches so we do a lot of boating on is that right wow that's pretty wild okay so you got some lakes around you can do that on so you do some skiing and stuff or yeah yeah a little bit just got through snow skiing yeah just came back from Denver but yeah all right yeah all right yeah that sounds good yeah we've uh part of the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now yeah it's it it was it was heavy when we were there though i didn't see any boats there though yeah not not not too many no but uh no i just got back from a weekend where we went and uh had a kind of a picnic in the woods type thing it was pretty nice but uh no i i have uh i had a boat last summer that i took out a catamaran that i do did a lot of sailing on and stuff that's a lot of fun but uh my parents are pretty big sailors too they're kind of into it but yeah uh all we all we have up here mostly bass boats oh yeah i guess it's pretty uh fishing's a pretty big thing huh um-hum lot of lot of fishing going on up here yeah yeah all right so where about in Texas is that is that centrally located or it's uh well you ever heard of Lufkin uh no what what major city is nearby Houston okay and that's south or north of there or something let me see Houston's north yeah okay Dallas is south oh okay all right well that sounds pretty good does uh i guess the weather does that stay pretty constant there or it's it's gets cold at night and then warm in the afternoons probably seventies eighties in the afternoon yeah okay well that's pretty temperate yeah that's not too bad but uh yeah have you done uh any other boating then or no i hadn't done any in a lately uh lately but that's all i used to have uh have a friend that owned his daddy owned a boat shop and we used to when i was in high school we used to go out yeah go boating everyday just about oh that's great yeah i and we had a new different boat everyday oh that's fantastic yeah i used to uh kind of be that way myself when i lived in in northwestern Florida in the panhandle i used to sail about everyday i'd work go to work i'd like to do some sailing yeah it's a lot of fun it's uh especially if you get a a pretty fast boat like those catamarans are pretty fast you can actually yeah what do you if you get one like that they have somebody teach you there or they just well actually i i've known how to sail pretty much my whole life um my my family's pretty into it and uh i took sailing lessons when i was about six and then uh yeah is it pretty easy yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it yeah so it's it's not too bad it's pretty easy to get the hang of i think and uh generally everybody i've i've known has kind of gotten into it but some people are more motorboaters you know which is fun yeah that well that's about all we have yeah yeah a lot of people don't don't see the excitement in sailing but then again they may ne'er may they may never have tried anything like uh catamaran um-hum and uh that's when you really start getting into speed you know you can actually some catamarans can actually pull people behind the skiers they get so fast you know i didn't know that yeah they get pretty quick but uh that that'd be something yeah yeah i haven't i haven't personally done that but um the races i i work with a guy right now that uh races catamarans in the summertime um-hum and uh he's pretty gassed about it he's got a good uh what kind of what lake do y'all use well he uh he's from Detroit so he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes i think and does his sailing um for me i i go back to Orlando uh in about a month um-hum and so down there basically just go to the coast we're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the East Coast and there's a lot of places there you can go you know ooh so uh so that's a good thing yeah but yeah so what do you do for a job uh well i build transformers oh really okay is that for TI or yeah no it's for Cooper Industries okay are they primarily electronic then yeah okay well that well they have a you know worldwide but right well well all we do here is make transformers electronics and stuff like that oh okay great yeah how do you like it down there in Texas it's real nice living here all my life yeah oh no doubt okay i've never been to Texas i've been to Oklahoma but uh that's about as far yep oh it's no Oklahoma's nothing like it yeah okay well that's good because i didn't like Oklahoma that well  so David uh what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of Florida they have the electric chair i believe remember Ted Bundy oh that's right couple years ago they were all down there saying fry him oh so the laws are still intact then oh yeah they yeah they use that all the time well not all the time is you know it it it's always backlogged it usually takes a guy usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they put him you know in the actual actual electric chair um-hum and i imagine that costs a small bundle too yeah he always gets all these appeals and everything go through the court process he gets all these appeals and everything uh as far as it being a deterrent to people i don't think it's a deterrent a deterrent uh i think it's i think it's more for the families more than anything the families probably get some justification out of it um-hum but uh as far as it deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that i don't think it really does no but i think it does serve a valuable purpose in the sense that the victims get some sort of satisfaction the community doesn't pay for the burden of having a the victims can a prisoner in jail for twenty years that's right that's right you know and having to supply them with a color TV and um books and education so forth right i mean what is it how much is it a year to keep a prisoner it's like twenty thousand a year to food and clothe a prisoner some ridiculous price and i imagine it probably costs a great deal amount of money to to even go through the process of trying to electrocute someone yeah to the court proceum i mean it tying up attorney's time uh times the court system yeah i don't know how many appeals Ted Bundy had uh they just keep appealing it and appealing it to the next higher next higher you know just keeps they keep going higher and higher up and uh you know it does take a long time it takes money of course to do that so and it's a public defender most of the time so um-hum well how do you feel about that do you are you in favor of capital punishment as a yeah yes i am i am in favor of it but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i don't think it is like i said it's mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims um-hum uh the you know the family of the victims do you guys have it up there where where'd you say you were from yeah i'm from New Hampshire okay New Hampshire they have it up there yeah as far as i remember we don't have it um i know there hasn't been anyone executed up here probably in about thirty forty years which is ironic because we come from very conservative state uh very strong on on punishment and crime um it uh during one thing we don't really have that that much crime up here when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i don't know if you heard about that that's the schoolteacher one right i saw the movie about that yeah that's a case where um she's probably guilty i don't think there's enough evidence there to convict her i mean to uh execute her um-hum i think if because once you execute someone the the the decision the decision is final you can't really reverse the process um well that is the bad thing about it and i'm i'm sure that back in the old days they they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process but they're but they're uh opinion was well if you got few few innocent people have to die to protect the majority then that's okay you know i don't i don't necessarily agree with that um-hum yeah i don't agree with that either i think if you kill someone who's innocent that's uh it screwed up the whole thing in my opinion yeah i agree with you there somebody you can't even live with if they you you really need to you know case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President uh that's pretty obvious that's open and shut isn't it right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be executed executed that's right uh whether he's insane or not that's right same thing with Dahlmer i mean he killed seventeen people right uh it's it's a shame that we're gonna have to pay for him now in his case now is that that's Minnesota right what's that is that Minnesota i think uh Michigan or somewhere somewhere around there or Wisconsin or ah maybe it's Wisconsin yeah they they might have capital punishment the thing with people like that they like to take and study them put them in jail and do studies on them like that so that's they can try to get a profile of his personality i think you know and i guess in states where they don't have capital punishment that's the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff aren't going to tolerate it yeah but i thought he he received his sentence um remember maybe what the what the final turnout was what is the final uh is he still going to trial for that i thought he went to rehabilitation rehabilitation mean they they were going to put him in rehabilitation for a few years then prison for the rest of his life that's right because he's definitely insane i think they proved that he was insane and maybe that's maybe that was uh what got him off or made him uh not get the death penalty because they can prove that he's insane then i i don't think you get the death penalty but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh say that he was sane when he committed them so they could but they they were going for the death penalty i think that's what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he going to get the death penalty or life in prison um-hum yeah i think the families wanted him to get death yeah i think that's a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of  okay uh well Steve do you take your entire uh family camping well we really haven't been camping per se here but we've camped in Wyoming well you have do you take the children with you oh yeah yeah i got a one child he's ten years old when we go camping uh we normally have to round up another child to keep him occupied otherwise otherwise he drives us nuts yeah well that that's basically the same way with us but we we kind of play games and stuff with him when we're camping do you do you wilderness camp uh yeah i have before before i uh got married i haven't since i've been married though your your wife doesn't like that wilderness camping does she well she she likes to go camping but we just haven't really had a chance to really go camping yeah my wife thinks Holiday Inn is wilderness camping she uh she got to have a bathroom and showers we live on the lake uh there's a very large lake here it's called Lake Laniers in north Georgia yeah uh-huh my house is on the lake so there's a lot of places to camp around around here where the they have rest rooms and showers and stuff like but the lake's really crowded so we normally go the mountains we found some nice little places in the mountains yeah there's a lot of state run camp sites now this they're charging us now do they charge you in Texas i'm not sure if they do or not it's uh i think uh some of the privately owned places do but i'm not sure about the government owned oh oh they do here they they uh you pay taxes to support it and then uh you pay to get in too yeah you know like a user fee i think they call them now so now do y'all do you fish and go camp do you take a boat or yeah well no not really we just usually kind of go camping and tent and cook and and just fish off the shore yeah it uh do you uh load the car down till the springs are dragging the ground we do we yeah we we got uh my wife is putting tables and chairs yeah got to have the comforts of home huh oh yeah it we have a hard time getting the uh recliners bolted on high on the car too well it takes three days to load the car and three days to unload it and we camp for about a day and a half yeah yeah i i can understand that but we really don't when we go we kind of plan everything out and we don't uh take a lot of stuff with us so do you know how old are your children Steve uh we just got a five year old a five year old boy that's rough to camping in when they're five it'n it well not really he's pretty good you know he when he when we ask him to do something he usually does goes and does it well when when uh ours is like i say is ten years old and i think they might be a little bit more hard to handle too yeah you got to keep them occupied and then plus you end up with a fish hooks in your ears and stuff like that well i kind of i kind of got a got him to where he's uh just got a weight on the end of his right now so he really doesn't know what catching fish is like so he just kind of practice casting right now well that's all they care about anyway yeah casting that's all my boy cares about seeing how for he can throw it i've tried to explain to him fish can swim yeah yeah he don't believe me but before i came in the service my dad always took us camping in the Bighorns in Wyoming uh-huh so we did a lot of that just about every year with the family so it was we drove we drove through there and looked that looks like it'd be beautiful out there oh yeah it is well one one summer we went in July and went camping and one morning we got up there's snow on the ground so sort of it kind of surprises you you know yeah i don't know if i could take that last time we went camping i went with my brother and his wife and we went up the on top of this mountain it was a little narrow road um-hum and it takes it's just eighteen miles but it takes like a hour and a half to get up that road it's a rough road yeah so we get up there and we sit around and we get ready to get ready for the camp that night and and they didn't bring the poles to hold their tent up so we're all had to cram this one little tiny tent and it rained all night long oh and i was stuck at the door and it just it just flooded me all night long this so that has been our last little camping experience yeah but uh we enjoyed it if we if you don't get pneumonia yeah it's it's pretty nice to get out and see the wilderness every now and then you know well there's getting less and less of it oh yeah i think  before the one will take um okay let's see i guess um i can start i'm actually we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing yeah are you really um so i'm looking at um something larger than what we have we've got like an eighty four Charger that's about gone and a uh an eighty nine Horizon uh-huh which are both kind of small so i'm looking for something a little bigger yeah um so we were thinking minivan for a while and uh we're looking at uh some just some four door five passenger sedans as well uh-huh are you looking for an American car or you you open to buying foreign cars um i don't really have a preference either way i guess it you know it's uh-huh you know i guess the American cars had a bad reputation but i haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones i've had uh-huh right personally i have a Japanese car right now and i really like it a lot uh i think the Japanese really build good cars and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole uh um-hum you know buy American keep American auto workers working right now but i feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our uh car manufacturers have for a while if i were to buy another car i would be uh yeah i would be partial to buying another Japanese car but i would also look at American cars but when i bought the car that i bought now i did that also and i just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product so if i were yeah i mean even even if it's just little details it seems like uh they you know like uh there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal and you have to take it back every once in a while and and it's clearly just a a design problem there right right it is um i'm kind of right now the next car i buy is gonna be sort of a sports car i would really like to have a sports car um i don't really i don't have a family so i don't need a a minivan or such to uh haul people around in um-hum so i'm looking for more a a two passenger car that uh oh like a Miata or something like that well i like the Miata but i don't like it enough to buy it i would buy something actually the the car that i really like right now is an Eagle Talon which is an American car but uh um something along that lines uh because i have a an economy car right now which is okay but uh i think i i'd like to move on to something a little better interesting yeah that's interesting yeah i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for you know size and safety and then mileage probably right right that's when i bought the car that i bought i was looking for mileage and i was looking for uh dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was get that i would get a uh-huh for the money that i was going to spend that i would get a return that was that was worth that money yeah yeah i can i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that so right exactly and then a little bit at life expectancy i guess but it you know depends on what you yeah what you pay initially but you know i've got a hundred and twenty five thousand miles on the Charger actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage um that's right uh-huh and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton uh-huh it's you know we we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles but uh-huh um the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it so okay but uh uh i've had uh i've had one or two American cars i think and and they were okay i had a Pontiac once and and i never had a problem with it but uh my mother had a Dodge at one point and i i had driven it a few times and i really did not feel that it that i would buy a Dodge just just from well actually i had a uh um a Dodge Omni at one point and that was i think what really prejudiced me against American cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality uh um-hum car yeah so i guess you'd have to say if i was looking i would definitely be looking for a foreign car that's interesting but yeah it it's hard to beat some of the uh like i guess we're in particular we're looking at a like a ninety one Corsica that's uh buy back at a they say GM sponsored auction but i think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to GM um-hum after you know it's after they've used it for six months and put you know twelve or fifteen thousand miles on it and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you right which is a good deal yeah because uh i guess um i mean well ninety two's granted but the new ones you know fourteen to sixteen is what they go for um-hum right on the lot so all the depreciation has been taken off and guess the dealer comes out okay you know i don't know what kind of i don't know what GM corporate kind of hit the i don't know what kind of hit they take on it but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off of it yeah that yeah i'm sure they did so but uh i don't know we keep looking at that minivan it's just you know we can get a like a Caravan for right twelve five but that's a little more than we want to spend right now uh-huh right but uh uh it's interesting but uh i don't know if if uh it it seems to be  uh so uh what are your benefits like at your job and how do you feel about them uh pretty good actually i work for Hewlett Packard and they have uh a pretty good uh benefits package in fact they're they're kind of known uh for having good benefits the pay isn't fabulous although i saw a survey recently and i'm actually making just about as much as you know i'm making making actually over average over the average for my career my experience and all that stuff which kind of surprised me so oh that's good uh-huh what kind of a degree have you got i've got a Bachelor's in electrical engineering so oh and i'm not like a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff uh-huh uh anyway the our benefits are pretty good we've got stock purchase program and a that that's pretty generous although you have to hold the stock for two years uh-huh before you get the company contribution which is kind of a a pain but uh there's a four O one K plan uh for uh sheltering some taxable income uh-huh uh-huh uh there's how long have you been with them i've been with them for seven years uh that's good yeah and the best thing and a lot of the stuff the best thing is like four years or five years it's pretty soon you're completely vested in the retirement plan and everything uh-huh so uh it's not too but there's full uh there there's several medical plans to choose from uh that cover pretty much everything i don't get sick that often so i don't pay much of it but you know i pay five dollars every time i visit the the hospital uh-huh that you know for a checkup or whatever uh-huh um they don't cover eyes though and i i have contact lenses so that's kind of a pain uh-huh but you know i i can live but for for all practical purpose you are almost a hundred percent covered oh yeah yeah so that you've got got small small things to gripe about right wow well that sounds like you must feel really good about it and yeah yeah and and the dental plan is fabulous the dental plan i pay absolutely nothing wow because uh i i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that but that's not the case so i guess nothing it's fabulous uh-huh uh-huh wow uh the what about you well i uh work in Washington at the Naval Research Laboratory i also have a part time job at a law firm and i get no benefits from them at to the part time work although they pay better per hour uh-huh than my my sort of quote real job does uh and benefits through the government are uh really uh they just uh they're not the greatest uh i before i i uh uh got my degree i'm uh computer a computer scientist uh uh-huh and before i got my degree i had uh done paralegal work for law firms here in Washington and uh uh-huh at that time i was in gravy city uh the law firms in this town are not you know for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the early eighties and uh benefits were just amazing and yeah uh-huh we had everything paid for and uh anyway with the government it's not uh quite that nice a deal uh but it's you know it's it's okay what we have to do is we have to pay uh about twenty percent of our uh uh our costs and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing and the plans that are available to us uh range from kind of mediocre to really sweet and uh so i i think i'm actually involved in a relatively good plan plan at this point um but uh it could be better that's for sure and yeah uh but you know there there are other things that you get when you work for the government i uh in in terms of uh more relaxed atmosphere it's really nice to be for me anyway to be able to work in uh a research atmosphere uh where i don't have to uh uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and so i'm i'm really kind of happy about that end of of things it's uh yeah the one of the things with my company is that they've uh got a reputation for a lot of job security and uh there's a lot of different uh-huh things that they do lot of different divisions even this area in the San Francisco Bay Area that they do so there's uh i myself have moved around quite a bit within the company uh-huh and it's and i and i haven't had to move my residence to do that you know i still live in San Jose and wow that's fabulous you see now that's that's interesting because i have a cousin whose husband works for Hewlett Packard up in the Massachusetts area he he lives in Andover yeah it oh yeah yeah uh-huh and uh the work that he he's uh specifically an engineer and and does work with uh the Hewlett Packard machines that do uh uh sonographic imagining right and uh i've been over to see his complex over there and it's amazing it's it's all ecologically designed and and uh he seems really really happy with the the set up um yeah yeah in fact i know a guy who works at Andover who used to work who i used to work with out here and he moved his family back east a few years ago to to take that position and uh-huh kind of interesting um uh anyhow  okay so how serious is the subject of crime in your area well needless to say here in Washington DC this is the war zone uh DC around here stands for drug capital or death capital it's uh it's really bad here uh for example the uh local high school uh they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns jeez and they're starting to uh get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school of all things so it well luckily it hasn't gotten that bad here uh San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime uh-huh uh-huh uh but it's on the uprise especially in a lot of the uh outlying agricultural towns uh-huh uh because you end up having a lot of gangs forming uh largely around the Hispanic core uh-huh uh it seems to be that uh gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions uh-huh right that's how they uh they bind themselves together in groups i guess and uh now the interestingly enough i don't think we have here a a lot of gangs but uh yeah only a couple uh of not a whole large group of them but uh just a few most of them centered around uh drug territory uh-huh uh-huh and so they're protecting their economic interests i guess and uh now nowadays the latest thing i've i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as yeah uh crimes involving stealing cars is that instead of stealing uh cars like at night breaking into them or whatever they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up and then as you get out of the car they just uh step up and uh take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house oh well that's efficient yeah that's the uh latest thing that way there's no damage to the car or anything they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything of that sort uh-huh right just wait for you to drive to your house you get out and they get in off they go with your car wow so it's uh i think they call it car jacking around here yeah yeah i'd heard that phrase uh-huh yeah that's kind of the latest thing but oh every year in the DC area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides so it's uh it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here we're from uh i'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so uh-huh and we've just come from twenty years in the military and uh which is an entirely different environment so this is a whole new thing for for us to to have to put up with and it's uh really scary sometimes yeah there aren't that many places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays right and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school and uh of course the mayor uh of DC is having a real problem uh uh-huh trying to what do you do to to reduce crime in a in a major city like DC where it's a way of life for everybody it's uh i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem i don't know what what the solution is uh there's no way they can stop the drugs and that's what's causing all the killing well uh there's a couple of things that i've heard uh most of them are fairly uh radical in terms of what you'd have to do uh uh-huh uh-huh course the the reason that that these kids tend to to turn toward the drugs and everything else seems seems to be just you know the the the end results of of poverty and and parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because i mean you know the parents aren't making a living at anything uh-huh right and they see all their friends and neighbors uh uh and they're accidental parents half the time anyway yeah and their friends are driving Mercedes and so it's actually they grow up with that as their way of life and uh i think uh to a large extent they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised it's illegal but it's not wrong because all their friends do it right exactly so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they they say well it's yeah it's the law that's uh got to be changed instead of their way of life so i don't know it's i'm glad it's not the kind of problem i have to come up with an answer to because it's not easy well i think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of of an actual solution to the problem um uh-huh the the social the other social problems wouldn't wouldn't go away right they've always been with us uh i mean there's there's been a lot of and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus but then the more i thought about it the more sense it made is that uh alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else uh-huh uh-huh uh and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really to slow right  okay national service what do you think about it i'm sorry i forgot i forgot your name already Lee Lee okay Lee oh well i think ideally people should want to do that automatically and that they should want to do what you know meshes with how they feel and what they're good at and they shouldn't be funneled into a mandatory sort of a thing um-hum um-hum um well you're not going to get a whole lot of disagreement from me none of the people that i talk to on this project disagree with me very much which kind of surprises me oh well in that case i think what this country needs is a good mandatory program to uh you know get people just thinking hey this is normal it's normal to do good you know to be civic minded you know just so they won't you know everybody will just think um-hum um hum well think of how much we have to pay for it i mean i'm you know i think if it's voluntary you get the people that want to be there this is the way things are and it they'll do well if it's mandatory you get everybody you get people that don't want to don't want to do work like that and they'll goof off or or sell drugs to their coworkers or something like that um well i'm not looking at the mandatory uh program as a cost effective way of getting this stuff done i'm looking at it as a way to shape people's psyches into thinking that public service is a good thing hum of course the program would have to work or else they'll think yeah public service another boondoggle you know they'll be sitting there working on the job doing nothing yeah i'm well think of it yeah yeah i i but i wonder about that the the mere fact that it isn't cost effective do you think that that if if it's not cost effective do you think that people are going to be enthused about it oh well certainly the people that do volunteer to do all sorts of things aren't thinking cost effective well you've got you've got a far fewer number what percentage of of of people do you think now do something like that um well i think everything that people you know what do people do they polish their cars right why do they do it because they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp hum not a cost effective thing you know they raise money to build a new church because they want to put eight zillion filigrees there because it's cost effective or because they need the space well i don't if you need the space i suppose it's cost effective because you can't get along with the old with with the old one but um no i i and it just seems to me that that that once you get everybody involved there's there's what there's eight million is it uh uh kids college uh turning eighteen every year i think it's about that might be a little bit lower now but uh that's an awful lot to to bring into a program you got to have eight million jobs available you've got to have administrators for eight million jobs that would be tremendously expensive not you know not to forget the cost of putting all of those kids in uh in in in non market uh enterprises enterprises for for for a couple of years uh that's going to delay their entry into the work force delay the time when they can begin paying taxes too so so the impact is going to be double there i um just don't see well you have to define the purpose of the program you know is there excess labor and that's why you're doing this no i mean what there's sort of both excess excess bodies available to labor but then there's not enough skilled labor i don't know i i think the so at the same time you have too many people who want to work or too many people who could work and not enough people who can work yeah uh i i grant to that but if that's the case then it needn't then then you don't have a mandatory you don't need a mandatory program to bring everybody into national service you just need a program for the people that haven't gotten anything gotten anything better to do and i think that might be a good idea although again then you get the kind of people who are likely to sell drugs to their coworkers et cetera well they did this in uh the depression they invented what the CCC right and uh they had a whole bunch of people go out west and dig ditches and plant trees and that's true but but i think that was different uh in at least three respects first of all um it was not a mandatory program if you didn't have another job you could join it you were not required to but it was a way to get a paycheck so people did join it secondly the time of the depression was just vastly different people were not as cynical about society about government and about the nation as they are now um so they didn't react negatively as many people would today and thirdly the economic conditions were different it was a big drain on the Treasury during the depression as well it's not clear that it made it any easier to get out of the depression  yeah okay so what kind of car do you want to buy next uh well i don't that's a tough decision um at the moment i probably should go for something that's that's more on the practical side of things right um so i don't know right now i drive a uh Volkswagen Golf GTI uh-huh um and that's a great little car for me because it's it's fun to drive plus you can fold the backseats down and and it's got a lot of storage room well do you have children are you married no huh-uh i'm single no well i am um divorced just just like in three days i'll be divorced and i have two little girls and um i have a Pontiac six thousand oh wow um-hum and um that's worn out and and if i would have had the money to go buy a car i would probably get a Toyota just because yeah really that's what everybody says i should get when i get a car is a Toyota they supposed to just last forever you know and um if i had my choice i'd want a minivan yeah yeah um-hum uh probably a Chrysler right you know Plymouth Voyager one of them other ones you know one of them that's what i would want lots of room so right right have room for them children to you know move around and not get cramped up and fuss you know so um-hum plenty of room for all the toys and everything but i would probably you know want something with really good gas mileage because i'm cheap you know so um-hum that would probably be my choices two choices yeah yeah i always try and go for something a little more sporty just because i don't have the well you're single and you know yeah i don't have the family to worry about it's just me selfish me yeah have them women look at you in that sports car driving oh goodness well true true i'm sure it doesn't hurt but uh yeah actually um i don't know you know that brings up the the question about uh American versus imports um-hum you know there's a lot of people saying buy American again you know but obviously uh neither of us would if we uh had the option um um-hum no i wouldn't no i wouldn't i guess yours is based on previous experience then maybe oh yeah well we had a Honda Accord and um an older one it was a eighty one and um it just you know lasted forever it was a really good car um-hum um-hum and um so i like them but um i have a couple of friends that have Toyotas and and they have a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand miles and not a thing goes wrong with them wow get great gas mileage and they still just run run run and i've got this poor pitiful Pontiac and thing breaks down every other day so you know um-hum so i don't know yeah i don't know it's it's it's interesting um you know i don't so if you were married and had children what would you want to buy oh jeez if i was married and had children uh do i have a budget or not of course you have a budget you're married and have children it depends are you a doctor or a lawyer then you don't have a budget or you just have a bigger one yeah no no not yet yeah yeah i guess everyone has a budget more or less um yeah i don't i don't know that's a good question um right i actually really like uh Jeep Cherokees uh-huh ooh i do too i like them yeah they're the problem is they're pretty expensive um they are well all just about everything is expensive now i mean you know the minivans are way on up there you know they're real expensive and true um-hum so you know yeah but i don't know a a a Cherokee would be nice uh or or a Wagoneer uh um-hum or gosh i don't know uh station wagon of some sort you know that that be an an alternative i'm i'm not too sold on the minivan idea uh you don't you don't like them well you know i've never driven one so i can't really criticize them fairly but i like riding in them do you i love them i think they're just great two of my friends have them and they're great they're i really like them they uh um-hum hm um i rode my one of my friends has a Dodge Caravan and one has a one had a Plymouth Voyager and i liked the Plymouth Voyager the best um-hum hm you know it was a little bit fancier um-hum you know they haven't had a bit of problem with them hm they ride ride real smooth and the kids have room and you know i like them right so anyway yeah yeah um i don't know i always like to to look for something a little with a little more power that's that's that's my main complaint against um like Toyota is because i think they always under power their cars uh-huh do they yeah um you know i mean they're they're great if if you're really looking for maximum uh  uh uh uh from my father oh really huh yeah he had he had given me the information and i said hm that's interesting so i thought i'd uh get involved and see what's going on with it yeah kind of curious because um some people found about it on the computer network others yeah oh is that right so they have a bulletin out on it yeah on the uh uh there's a network around like around the world and uh there's a Telecom Digest oh okay huh interesting um i guess uh the topic we're talking about did they introduce the topic on your side yeah taxes yeah and whether we're getting enough for the income and all that stuff right okay this the first time i've done this so um um we'll just yeah hold on a sec i'm on a i'm on a cordless it's giving me some trouble oh you are jeez that make it better uh all set yeah okay now what what do we do just press one and go for it yeah this is kind of weird um all right um uh what what do you want to do as a prompt for the question um oh you you didn't press it yet did you no okay um i don't know see uh no i'm a student i don't pay much in taxes except for when i work that's a little bit yeah oh you're a student oh okay um hm uh why don't i ask you the question um you know uh i don't know um being uh do i'll just ask you know do do you think income taxes work for this country or should we have a broad base tax a broad base tax in terms of of everybody just pays a flat rate okay i have an answer for that ten percent what i have an answer for that okay all right i'll talk to you in a bit hold okay uh i'll just press one okay here we go yeah okay go ahead yeah okay right i guess i guess i'm just wondering uh what your thoughts are on taxes uh um do you think that we should just have a kind of a broad based tax or just uh or do you like it the way it's set up now um i think a progressive tax the way it is now is is good um taxing uh those people with more money uh taxing them a little more i mean those people who can afford to pay it out i mean there it wouldn't be fair to um like with say lower class people who don't make as much money yeah to uh pay out the same amount of taxes as someone making millions of dollars well yeah i suppose that's i suppose that's true in i i guess i'm more for kind of a just a across the board tax because that way everybody would pay the same a rate that's equal to what they were doing i mean if somebody only made ten thousand dollars a year and it was a ten percent tax they're paying a thousand dollars whereas if somebody's making a million dollars a year yeah okay uh you know what i mean they're paying a hundred thousand dollars in taxes yeah as opposed to which what it seems like now which is you know these guys get away with uh all these tax breaks and everything else like that that apply to them but they don't apply to the little guys so it seems like the all the taxes you know taxes are being paid by everybody else seems kind of crazy so you're saying um ten percent let's say a broad base ten percent tax uh without any loopholes or yeah exactly exactly just everybody pays ten percent that's it and then nobody has to worry about whether you know i get this and i get that and uh you know or this person gets a tax break but this person doesn't when this person makes that much more money right i mean that way you know somebody that's uh that's making uh ten million dollars pays a million bucks in taxes they um uh see i guess the problem with that is are they really using their fair share is who of the person that pays that many that much more taxes yeah but then again they have as much use to the of the system as everybody right hm i yeah i see the i see the logic behind that i don't know if that that would make sense i guess uh i guess what people do i guess the government's incentive now is to create incentives so that people will do more i guess house building or buying homes or you know because of they give them break tax break on their interest because i have a break on our interest i mean all our our all our mortgage interest is deductible yeah right um but it doesn't seem like they do a damn good job with the uh uh with the way they're spending the taxes to hm yeah promote borrowing with tax breaks promote investment yeah exactly i mean they only just recently got rid of the interest uh that was deductible on credit cards and car loans and things like that right personal tax yeah but the major borrowing is still there i mean you know on mortgages and things like that uh although i don't think that we could afford our house without having that uh mortgage deduction hm right um you know it actually cuts down four hundred bucks a month i think that think something like that luxury tax was a mistake did they did they repeal that yet i don't know that's a good question i i don't know whether they did or not because i mean yeah you're uh trying to get back at trying to sort of maybe punish i don't know the rich and make them pay some more but it what happened was the the result was that uh sales went down in yachts and those kind of things right and so the little guy who works for those that employer  okay so i guess what kind of experience do you do you have then with child care i think um i wonder if that worked does it say something i think it usually does you might try um i don't know hold it down a little longer okay well okay i does it usually make a recording or something well i don't remember it seemed like it did but it might not i guess i guess okay we can start um okay no i don't i don't have any kids i um my sister has a she just had a baby he's about five months old and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was gonna do with him and um-hum the different do you have kids i have three oh really uh-huh yeah i do yes um i don't work though but i used to work and when i had two children um-hum i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit but i don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care yeah but does your sister live in a big community um yeah she lives it's a it's a fairly large community she um got real lucky though she had a boss who um moved into a larger office um-hum and she's able to take her baby to work with her oh really and it's a small office that she works in um-hum and um it's a it's a legal firm office and it's just one lawyer and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office there's no one else that works there um um-hum and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby so it works out pretty good for her wow how lucky i i know a lot of people around here sometimes have like mothers or grandmothers that take care of their kids and but yeah the community i'm in is not a real large one so there are a lot of people who babysit in their home that you know you either know them or know somebody who knows them to get yeah so it's fairly safe to yeah to get references and that so but um i i don't don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center but simply because there's so many kids and so many worried that they're not going to get enough attention yeah and um you know colds and things like that get spread real easy and things but and they're expensive and yeah course there's a lot of different types of day care available too you know where they teach them academic things yes or they just watch them and let them play and things like that but take a long time to find the right place yeah and you and you don't always even know if it's it's gonna be the right place or not um-hum anything i guess could happen um-hum because after i guess after he you know gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care um-hum when he starts toddling around and stuff yeah yeah when when he's not when she can't keep control of him and he starts crawling that's um-hum it would be hard i think it would be kind of stressful it would be nice to have him around um-hum but um seems like you know golly what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or you know at the wrong time but yeah i think she has problems with that too um-hum well when you have kids will you work do you work now i don't know that's something i've considered um um-hum i always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time um-hum is that what you do um yeah uh actually i teach my kids at home so i'm here all the time oh so they don't go to school is it like um oh what's that called it's a correspondence school they do it at home uh-huh yeah yeah that's interesting do you have to have any special training so not it depends on the state you live actually some laws absolutely prohibit it some states um say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that our state doesn't yet say that and i'm not a certified teacher i went to college but i um-hum you know but my kids are only elementary grades levels right now and so so they haven't been to public schools at all one of them was for a couple of years and so you know my oldest he was and then my youngest two have never been hm so anyway but we don't so you've never had  do you feel about the issue of uh random or spot drug testing well i'm i'm for it based upon my experience uh in taking uh drug tests my uh my past experience in the military um-hum plus uh my current occupation working uh for a defense contractor here in Massachusetts uh i feel that it's uh there is some opinions whereas the uh uh people of the mind that uh it's a right to privacy that you know it's a it's a bodily function involved and that um um people should have a right to protect themselves and so forth but i don't agree i think that um it's important particularly for some jobs and some jog occupations job occupations that um people can be screened for uh should be screens for uh for drugs through uh drug testing yeah i i tend to believe that that it's it's important for those jobs where uh where the the person has the safety of other people uh in their own hands or within their control then i think it should be mandatory um-hum you know the the airline industry the transportation industry um you know the uh right the defense and military you know any any application like that i think it should be mandatory yeah so i think we're in agreement that that uh uh that it's a good uh it's a good idea in some circumstances the one reservation i have though in that from my experience i've taken many urinalysis many drug tests right um-hum some of them random some of them um scheduled uh and every time you take one of those tests you know when you're submitting a sample yeah there's always in the back of your mind well how are you know people conducting the test the labs that are performing the test how adequate uh are those facilities and uh is is always it is it always a chance i know that what they call um the i think it's called the chain of custody right of the uh the specimens themselves i know in the military in the military particularly they there's a they go to great lengths at protecting the samples before they get to the labs um-hum right but my concern is and i think that that that what needs to be further investigated is the uh the standardization and to have some hundred percent insurance that the test that's given uh the the the lab that performs the uh the analysis is uh validated in some way you know some standardization because i've heard some horror stories right you know yeah you you you know you can easily envision the one one mistake could you know ruin a a career that couldn't be uh you know couldn't be resurrected Sixty Minutes did an article on this whole subject subject a few uh a few years ago and there was a Air Force Captain who uh you know took the test and it came up positive and the guy swore on a stack of bibles yeah now in the military for a for a staff staff NCO which is a a noncommissioned officer but it's a certain rank above i don't know if you're familiar with military military rank structure no it's a it's a high level of enlisted personnel and officers for those people who show up positive on one drug test they're immediately discharged yeah now for certain ranks and below like sergeant and below if you're found positive or come up dirty in a drug on a on a drug test yeah you can be reduced in rank forfeit your pay or if it's a repeat repeat offense uh offense yeah then they can discharge you but there's this Army this this Air Force Captain he swore up and down that he didn't do anything right and they went back and you know few months later to try to investigate the lab and the sample that he had given was destroyed yeah right so i i think you got to be careful with stuff like that that's that's my only concern about the whole issue i think huh yeah definitely yeah i don't really feel like you know for any any of the just routine jobs that people should be subject to that kind of invasion of privacy yeah um only for the only for the ones where it's critical um-hum uh yeah because there's a big thing in in the in the here on the east coast the Boston Police Department uh the Policemen's Association took the uh the Boston Police Department to court because they were uh trying to institute drug tests for the cops here in Boston right right and um they won the Police Department the the Police Association won and it it was a right to privacy type deal that they approached it and the courts agreed yeah i i guess i would feel that the you know police uh that the police should be one of those public uh safety issues where you know mandatory drug testing where it would be favorable yeah oh yeah definitely well you know the thing is is in all these transportation accidents this uh  right uh actually i lived over in Europe for a couple of years i lived in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system what they do is they have uh three judges basically and you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence go off figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not our our our judicial system is in such total chaos i think what they need to do is they need to somehow take the money out of it i mean when you have a man that's signed a a a statement saying he's guilty we have a a family called all day family they were all murderers uh-huh all the people signed confessions they went to a trial by jury they been trying these people now for twenty two years ever since i was a child wow and what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done has nothing to do with justice whatsoever well you know it's it's one of those things i mean uh uh i would have to look at that if they did it with the uh just the judges the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day they know all the procedures they know what's good and what isn't they'd be able to say i'm sorry you can't use this as uh evidence you know because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and you know you wouldn't have this uh uh theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the to the jury and then the judge says oh no disregard disregard that come on any jury's not going to disregard the evidence you know uh that's true i i i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself that may very well be i i hold it in the utmost contempt the uh uh that's a the the my favorite is the police department they're not aimed at the criminal the judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and i we have work schedules we can be called at work we have Social Security numbers they can trace us down we have telephones and we have checkbooks criminals have none of these things they're real difficult to catch and if they do catch them they don't get any monetary gain out of it whereas us we write a check yeah so where do you think they target their efforts that's true you do have a they target their efforts toward the citizens not the criminals well how would you go about changing it you know that's a i've nailed the problem down but i leave the details up to somebody else huh yeah i'm going to have to leave those details like what would you do about i think to begin with you would have you would have like here in Atlanta area our crime rate is just astronomical yet you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets yeah i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from well you know uh talking about the lawyers you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to set the fees for cases it's kind of like do it do it in the similar vein similar like uh VCR or television repair if you take your TV in a lot of these TV repair places will say well i'll repair your TV for a hundred dollars and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it then he eats it he he repairs it gives it back to you and takes your hundred dollars now if he comes in and says you know i'll repair your your VCR or somebody else's VCR for a hundred dollars gets in there maybe it's a blown fuse takes him two minutes he fixes it he still charges you that hundred dollars so maybe if we did that with the lawyers so that you know whether it's a murder case or a you know a civil uh somebody suing somebody else you get X dollars for that case and that's it none of this now i i firmly believe in that because when you get the most heinous of crimes have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney and here's this bum that didn't have a job and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford oh yeah yeah that's true yeah who's paying for that um yeah well you you know you're talking to part of them that's paying for that yeah and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it that's right you know that's it it's it's amazing and and when you stop and look at it i mean the judges they're they're all former lawyers yeah well that's another problem i think to really correct the judicial system you have to get the lawyers out of it i mean they're they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever and with that type person running it i mean you you could expect that you you could expect that you  community i'll start we have a lot of uh we we've started doing some and uh in in uh we live in a suburb of Chicago recycling has become somewhat in vogue we've always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin but it's totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pains places because it's it's a drive out of your way to take things to these but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation which is uh you have to now pay for each trash bag that that the garbage man picks up you have to pay a dollar and a half and we uh you have to buy a sticker uh and it costs a dollar and a half and you have to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you don't have that sticker on there then the garbage man won't pick it up now that's that that's for regular trash if you have recyclable trash i would like newspapers or right now it's limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles then they'll pick that up for free so there's the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable bin or recyclable uh container they they give you one of these then that that doesn't cost anything so that encourages people to participate well that's makes sense ours seems really crazy because well we've had the places all the shopping centers i mean the local shopping centers where there's a grocery store and a you know drug store and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans that type of thing for uh oh the Kiwanis or some sort of groups pick them up and make money for their causes and those are fairly popular and work fairly well uh-huh and you can also take your own stuff to a recycling center and you know get the few pennies you get for the papers or cans i know some people who do that but to me that too much trouble for the few cents the uh so i just drop it off at the local place when i go to the store and let them you know some good agency make some money off of it what little they get and uh that works for me but now as i understand it from reading the paper the system seems totally backwards right uh they are starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and a half a month uh-huh and that's because they will give us containers you know certain colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in that all makes sense but if you don't want to recycle you can say i don't want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month oh no which the theory is that if you don't want to recycle with the city who actually has a private contractor do it uh if you don't recycle with the city then you're going to take it yourself and you know make your money off of your paper and cans somehow it seems to me like people will just say i don't want to pay the buck and a half and i'll throw it in the garbage so so like somebody messed up it sounds to me like it's messed up but they've had a strategic miscalculation on their part i guess so we'll have to see what happens they're just supposed to start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and different kind different colors for different things uh so it's totally voluntary even if you pay your dollar and a half you don't you you can still put everything in the trash you still could so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and i think i understand it pretty well from both the paper and TV and we'll see what happens uh any idea how many people are going to do it are going to do it oh supposedly the majority are okay it's pretty ecologically conscious here so some of the people will go along with it anyway oh i think so plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a half and not even notice the difference or care yeah but uh it seems strange now at the the university where i work it's uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them well and uh there is a campus recycling bins not bins but like i work in a library yes and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different types of things but they're in staff areas but we have wanted to have specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines  okay so i guess it starts recording now okay i don't know really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in we live in the Saginaw area Saginaw um-hum and i'm not real familiar with uh anything that i in fact the far as i know the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here and uh or the grocery story or anything in this area yeah really the recycling we live in Plano and they started off recycling by um putting the i think at each Wal-Mart they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that which it now i guess the uh city has has bought these big green trash cans and uh we they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you separate your glass and paper uh-huh and uh aluminum and you set it out and they pick it up and it it works real neat they seem to be having a real good response really but that is pretty good i'm we're originally from another state and i know in the state we were from that they did that type similar type thing the city brought out you know separate trash separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know did they did they like on bottles did they give you a so many cents back for i don't really know i don't really know they they started after we moved down here and so i i'm not really familiar i just know that and my in-laws up in up in Oklahoma that's how they do you know they pick it up but i don't know if they get a for cans even i've seen that in really get anything back on it or do you get money for it no i've just i noticed in Iowa and other cities like that it's a nickel per aluminum can oh so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets really even bottles you know all kinds of bottles they they they really charge people to uh i guess when you purchase them and and then when you turn them back in right i know i remember the old days as a kid where a bottle was a nickel and right and now now most of them are the throwaway right so maybe that's one thing they could do to and yeah i think now they're a lot more expensive than that um i bought some Cokes the other day in the bread the little bottles um-hum you know and i think the bottles were like i know they were at least ten cents apiece i was trying to figure out how i was like God how much were those bottles you know and it was they come in like uh eight and and eight and ten packs you know well that's right instead of six packs and uh and they were like it was like two dollars and something for the bottles you know i was like God Almighty costs more for the bottles than it did for the Cokes that was my brother's first job in a grocery store he was in the bottle area we're gonna bump our heads what a job it's pretty dangerous out there you know when they fall over but but it's uh right it's quite they say that the green glass now that there's a big glut oh really of green of green glass with the green glass yeah it's amazing uh well out in this area they really don't have anything now i know that like Minyard's uh-huh and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores they have like four different bins out front right yeah different colors for different things and and things like that but i i did know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people coming and dumping their trash in them right yeah it's i notice the plastics have sort of faded away the milk jugs it it's yeah people just they they really don't uh there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff yeah yeah it's i don't know it it can be it's not as easy more than it's worth collecting you know clean junk as they say right right well who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away that's right that's right it's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher right i know we all do it well it was nice talking to you it was nice talking to you i have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything well i think i think two or three minutes is fine and yeah it is that it okay well it was nice talking to you and i i guess i'll do this for i was doing this from actually i was gonna do it for my son so that he could uh he he's in high school so that he could uh make some money right and but then it has my name on it so i'm like okay i'll sit down here and call it oh we're doing it for a church choir so oh are you yeah so oh that's interesting that's nice well thank you good-bye well thank you bye bye  well uh does the company you work for test for drugs actually um they just recently started a policy of testing drugs which was kind of interesting because when when i went to work for them um they didn't do that but uh since then they've they've started a drug testing policy not because of their own um convictions but because the clients of our company are requesting that we do that huh how about you uh no we're not being tested for drugs at all uh our policies and procedures manual uh the furthest it goes about drugs is in the kind of the miscellaneous section or it's reasons for immediate dismissal it says use of narcotics on company premises uh-huh hum so that's pretty general but um i work for an environmental management firm and i'm an engineer there but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites but i don't operate any machinery okay yeah now people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a a medical monitoring program because they're uh-huh at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and i i think that drugs they do test for drugs in that capacity but it's not their exclusive it's just part it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for yeah but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field what is the nature of your company's business well it's actually uh we do oil well services so a lot of our clients are oil companies big oil companies and they go out to we have engineers who uh go out to the oil well to the to the client's oil well and and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff so the clients are very concerned that you know the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy because they're on their their you know territory and everything but huh the thing that's interesting is that i work i'm an engineer and a software engineer and i work in the software uh house and everybody there you know are all software engineers they've never you know they never go out to the the oil rigs or anything and yet we're getting we're subjected to this policy you know the same one that uh the all the engineers have to to well a little different actually but um you know we have to go through the same thing and it's but it's uh it's a little different i guess than than a lot of drug policies in our case it's like when you hire on they'll test you and then if you get injured on the job if you like trip and fall or something uh they give you a drug test right away oh really other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that but a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first particularly like um we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol and that they didn't find any problem with that you know but right we that's been an a an issue uh um in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll have these little parties and people will just get i mean i've my brother lives near where i work and i have many a time called him to come get me you know and um uh but you you know they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg you know but um i think drug testing and i i don't know yeah i guess i can i think it's got some relevance but i think its relevance is pretty limited i mean i think you know in your case i don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing i think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident yeah yeah it's really it's really bizarre uh particularly like where we are you know i there was a story of a woman last year who who actually did slip on the ice and and like sprained her ankle and she she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and i don't know i'm ambivalent about the whole thing i you know i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand it's like if you know they're they should be able to make it as a condition of employment in some sense and you know it's like you're i mean employments are contractual by nature anyway um-hum but um i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job that where i had to um uh do a drug test and and it's it was kind of a long story but it was it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through and it amounted to um going in uh before any of these interviews i'm not even working for this company i'm going in for like interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and and uh before i went in to any of the interviews uh they took me to the doctor to give me a physical they said it was going to be a physical you know and um actually because beforehand they told me they were going to uh do drug screening but i had forgotten about that and so basically i'd already peed off in that morning and and when i got in there i didn't i wasn't like able to give a full sample and so they made me sit and wait for forty five minutes drink a whole ton of water before i went to any of the interviews oh right and go in there again and the and the the procedure is utterly humiliating you go in there with the doctor he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you  John i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment how about you i am i yes and uh uh what was the first part of the uh subject that you well uh do you think it should just be restricted to certain crimes oh i i basically do i think uh other than murder uh the probably uh i don't think there's a need for it if uh if it's not if the case is doesn't involve murder i don't see any need for it in anything else any other circumstances i guess it's an eye for an eye well there are those that say it's not a deterrent to others but i think it certainly deters the one that uh oh yeah gets the capital punishment well yeah i guess the other argument is that you might execute the wrong person but uh i don't know i just think the chances of that happening are pretty slim of course it's it's not reversible uh obviously but uh i just think the way the system is set up uh the chances of the wrong person being executed are are really very small uh yeah uh i've served on a few juries and they take a they seem to take a lot of care to make sure they've got the uh the right person whatever for the conviction levied that's that's true well certainly Texas uh as a state believes in capital punishment i don't know i wonder if we execute more people than other states or um-hum i don't know you every once in a while if you hear if there's some who's fairly famous or notorious being executed in another state you read about it or hear about it but uh i don't know how we rank up there with the other states but uh i think it's a deterrent i i don't i mean it wouldn't be a deterrent for everybody obviously but i think uh if it uh if it saves one person's life it may be worth it uh if one person who was going to kill somebody thought otherwise because of the uh possibility or a possibility of capital punishment it uh it may be worth it but i think it's a deterrent yeah i think so too uh and and we fail so miserably in rehabilitating any kind of criminal um-hum right and and i i don't know i wonder if there are other crimes uh a repeated rapist for example or yeah uh i don't know kidnapping of course is a capital crime but i well is that uh is that punishable by death in Texas or is that up to the jury to decide or the judge i doubt that i i don't know i never thought about that but is that is that a capital crime don't know i think so but maybe not maybe not i could be confused what do i know huh don't hear much about don't hear much about kidnapping anymore kidnaps uh i'm not a kidnapper well there've been a few over in in i guess i not recently i guess but the uh the whole judicial system is a mess like you said there's no rehabilitation in the prisons and so they get out of prison and they're they're back to doing what they were doing before they went to prison that's right they haven't learned a lesson well i certainly don't agree with a with a murderer getting a sentence of twenty years and being out in seven or whatever it is um-hum yeah i think that's just totally inappropriate yeah well like you said rape uh that there's a possibility there for uh capital punishment and that that's a serious enough crime that uh it maybe warrant capital punishment but what gets me is the uh i may be getting off the subject somebody might get forty five years for stealing i mean for robbing something of course that i think to get that they'd have to be a repeat offender that'd be more than one or two cases involved but the the whole judicial system seems to be lopsided messed up yeah you don't uh so you don't think that capital that capital punishment is appropriate for repeated robber or no no i really don't uh no murder and again rape possibly a repeated uh rapist may be uh a candidate for capital punishment but uh the really serious stuff i don't this burglary and robbery and uh that sort of thing even if they're multiple offenders or repeat offenders i i wouldn't condone capital punishment for that no uh yeah i i don't know what the consensus in the state is i know it was it was a few years ago that the Supreme Court struck down capital punishment didn't they didn't they tell the states to go back and review the circumstances yeah yeah that uh it was it was uh there was no capital punishment for a long time there i don't know fifteen twenty years maybe something like that they and uh i know when i was growing up there was uh there were a lot of uh electrocutions up in Sing Sing up in New York upstate New York and then uh they did away with like you said Supreme Court outlawed it and then it came back on a state by state basis yeah but uh  well i guess there's a lot of uh complex issues here some of which are moral and some are um more logistical as to the merits capital punishment i suppose the uh the moral ones are are the more nebulous when it comes to trying to discuss and the logistic ones i guess are uh i suppose a reasonable default on um issues the moral issue would be just let everybody live and not um not try and make those kind of judgmental errors but that goes and affects the logistical ones in that now you have to care for somebody that you otherwise wouldn't have to i suppose that might actually be a uh pretty rude way of rude way of looking at it though oh yeah i guess it has to do with uh what anger revenge yeah yeah oh what human life is worth and whether or not you can rehabilitate somebody yep yeah those are all good ones i suppose uh another one is um if you do decide that it's uh you know you want to do this is somebody capable of making the judgment rationally you know do we have the um do we really have that ability to go out and judge somebody's crime all these circumstances and other stuff and weigh it you mean do we have the right or are you talking logistical here can we really do it are we are we that good that we can really do it it's like uh like nuclear power plants you know it's a great idea but logistically we just haven't been able to get our act together well enough to well that i think you can take that nice simple nice simple nice problematical logistical argument and say well are you morally able to make a mistake you know what what is uh is it all right to guess wrong once in a while um yeah yeah and if it's if it's not acceptable to ever make a mistake you know ever sentence somebody to death that shouldn't be yeah exactly then uh you can't use the death penalty yeah or shouldn't well yeah okay shouldn't be using it there's a lot of can'ts and shouldn'ts and don'ts and stuff that seem to be pretty well ignored these days um so what are they doing down in uh Georgia well Evan uh i suppose they do have the death penalty down here i don't know if um if they executed anybody on it recently i don't think so uh i don't know you know it's gotten to the point where something like that if i see it in the paper or hear about it it's just kind of like in one ear and out the other some state recently executed somebody where was that Texas oh i haven't heard about any lately uh Florida was doing a few weren't they yeah what kind of crimes is it that they usually do this for murders big murders uh yeah usual serial killers or multiple murders like if uh you know somebody kills a family or yeah yeah what did they uh give Jeffrey Dahlmer what did they do to him didn't they lock him away in a uh psychological ward uh that would make too much sense no no they didn't they didn't they just let sent him to prison that's right yeah yeah seemed to me it was a relatively senseless thing to do with somebody that was so rare something kind of wasteful not that um not that we need more or anything like that yeah that was a bizarre case and i guess are they did the government federal government pass some recent um regulation something about for certain certain crimes uh if um there's a gun involved or something like that the death penalty is automatic or is there something like that out there uh well there's something like that and there's always proposals to uh make punishment nastier yeah you know or whenever somebody gets off lightly somebody visible gets off lightly they you know the judge has what like a range of sentences he can give like three to ten yeah there's some real yeah they're they're often does seem to be backlash against light things and he gets the i guess occasionally there's some about harsh stuff one harsh sentence that i kind of liked was uh Jim Bakker getting forty five years that's that seemed like justice but it seems they reevaluated his sentence or resentenced him or something like that i don't know if they changed it yeah there's a general impression that uh these snakes get off eventually uh like Klaus Von Bulow yeah who will i guess  Steve uh with the election year and whatnot coming up do you think we ought to cut taxes raise them or or or what do you think well that's that's a really hard question i do know that uh politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths um i let's example uh our our friend the President right now says no new taxes we should and especially if anything be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases so uh i know the politicians uh aren't aren't straightforward now in in terms of economics i'm not it's hard hard to call it really is uh-huh see i never thought really it's uh i never really thought that that the the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little i i always that the the real question was is are we getting a reasonable return on on investment for instance like Social Security tax or Social uh i mean that's that's tax we're paying money and and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire the money will be there for us hm right that's yeah you know when i when i see that money taken out of my paycheck each each week i or each every other week i i really think that money's history and you know so as far as return investment that's not that's nothing and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back yes uh uh someone was telling me that there is a uh uh there's still an office in uh you know staffed with with people there and in DC that are researching to find a cure for polio which i may be wrong but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded but but supposedly once you have an office in DC or you know and and staff it with people it's really tough to close it down and and they just haven't yet well yeah i'm not exactly sure uh about polio in particular i know we have a polio vaccine which will prevent somebody from getting polio i'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio uh-huh well that might be the difference i don't know uh the other thing that uh i remember seeing on TV lately is uh had to do with it's like seventy five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically right that that historical for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything seem to appear as as almost as like political favors to to very strong politicians yeah it's it's it's funny because uh it was one of the things that Bush is been trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where uh you know Congress is able to attach all kinds of uh funny amendments for individual uh congressional congressional districts to the to the main budget proposals and uh-huh the poor President has has to uh either accept or reject the whole thing so it sounds like you uh you think that that we'd be able to save some money by uh passing the line item veto uh i i think the line item veto is not not is not necessarily a bad thing assuming that the uh the the President uh uses it to get rid of uh this kind of waste on the other hand uh uh it it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things yeah right and just to get rid of the unimportant things and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment there's always going to be a dispute as to uh where the exactly where the boundary between waste and and necessity is uh-huh so i'm not i'm not sure that that that will help solve our problems but there definitely is is a problem with uh i forgot there's a political term for this stuff pork barrel or something yeah pork barrel politics uh pork barrel politics there there there has to be some way to do it i know state governors usually have line item vetos and uh well i i lived in Massachusetts for a while and uh when Dukakis vetoed certain things there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular yeah but Massachusetts wasn't when Dukakis was there anyway wasn't in that great shape financially but at least at the end uh-huh i mean i don't know i yeah i i they were very good at first they were in very good financials at first and uh that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well and then of course the bottom fell out it's uh i mean it's it's tough i mean there's there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and and whatnot and spare the economy yeah it's really it's a hard balance it it definitely is even not for government even just say for a small business um i know some  type of music is hot down in Texas uh well i don't know exactly what's hot down in Texas i know what's hot down here with me so that's about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know i don't ever listen to the radio and that's usually what's hot around here so oh okay so what kind of music do you like uh mostly folk music folk music yeah i find myself uh listening to a lot of uh uh either old timer or New England uh dance bands as well as uh just more popular folk music and new artists coming up uh-huh well we're on totally different wavelengths okay i'm i'm more uh old rock and roll uh some new newer i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type uh-huh you know uh Van Halen that kind of thing any yeah what about uh classic rock type stations uh i don't listen to the radio at all we live in a fairly small town so uh classic rock for me is what i have which is like uh Doors Eagles Jimmy Hendrix oh okay so some some of the older Eagles stuff was good uh yeah i i didn't like uh they started getting a little more you know the type of music at at least to me it's uh sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes and i don't like listening at high volumes yeah yeah but uh some of their older stuff stuff was uh you know quite enjoyable to me yeah well it's you know Hotel Hotel California and that era yeah yeah that does that's something you don't doesn't even sound good loud really yeah so yeah definitely so anything new you like coming out now other than folk music some i might know of i don't know any folk music at all well down in Texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then yeah oh yeah we hear i'm sure i'm sure there's a lot of that down there oh plenty way way more than i can stand down here i i don't care for it at all that Texas twang or whatever you want to call it i well there there's a Conway Twitty twang then there's the uh Dolly Parton uh Hollywood sound type yeah yeah that's more even more commercialized form of country music but uh it's getting uh uh getting pretty big everywhere as i see it Garth Brooks is outselling Guns and Roses so it's yeah yeah i think some of them the artists are even uh hitting the pop charts yeah it's it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is concert tours for country and western singers is it's it's quite quite odd but uh i don't know it's music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays i think it's becoming not necessarily good music just popular music you know it's it's it's hey i i i think most artists are in to make a few bucks yeah and that's all it's it's but they're not in it to say anything or give a message which is what they were do late late sixties early seventies they were they were definitely pushing a message yeah yeah that's what it it was yeah that's what what you say and and then music is wrapped around now now it's the other way around yeah and i don't i don't think gun at least to my mind Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message too much to say no no they don't have anything really important you want to hear but you know it's kind of odd it's like doesn't have to be good it's just who does it you know you hear a you hear a Paula Abdul song and you and i think if somebody else were to play that uh-huh you know they wouldn't they nobody everybody would think that's lousy but because she did it it's supposed to be good you know it comes to the point where it's your name not what you do right more than anything Madonna can do anything and it would be considered good because it's Madonna you know right Madonna could start playing folk music and folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it so it's it's it's really backwards how things are working now but uh-huh yeah it it it's the artist not the merit yeah exactly so i don't know i i don't know that that's i don't think that's a good thing at all but that's that's what the point we've reached so i don't know yeah how how much farther we can digress before we have to turn it around and go the other way at least well i don't know i know for myself that uh for the most part i don't know which artist is which so i listen to a song i either like the song or i don't like it and then if i really like the song eventually i'll figure out who it was yeah you yeah yeah that's about how i am on popular music i don't you know you don't i don't know enough about it because i just listen uh everything i listen to is what i buy not whatever they play on the radio so well you have to figure out what to buy or do you just buy along the same artist and uh i yeah i just mostly buy along the same lines all the time i don't really switch around to new things very often yeah it's just it's you know it's way to hectic and too confusing it's yeah so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album then you stop uh yeah generally or about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know will buy something new that i haven't heard and i listen to it that way but yeah as far as yeah i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it yeah see that's one thing i like about the uh some of the folk music scenes you know there's a couple of nice uh small coffee houses up in New Jersey yeah and it's very nice you go into the coffee house and you know an artist is there and very often the artist will have a demo an album and so if you like the artist you buy the album yeah so you definitely get to try before you buy yeah yeah that's definitely i that's though it you you you don't always quite get it right  all right okay well how about those Redskins huh they're pretty good they um you know i can't they're not they're they're a good team you know yeah uh but uh i think uh i don't know how they'll do this year they'll probably still do pretty good have you uh been keeping up on the people they've been trading or anything do you think uh yeah they hadn't i don't think they really traded anybody that i know of yet um i've i've got three kids who collect football cards yeah yeah so they uh they compete pretty vigorously for all the Redskins cards and uh actually we went to after they won the uh the uh Super Bowl we actually went down to the mall in uh Washington and saw uh you know all the players down there and they had a big rally down there and so it was surprising how big those guys were i mean they they look big on the field but they're even bigger in person though yeah oh yeah they especially that guy Joe Jacobi yeah he's just a guy's a monster i mean he's not inhuman but most of them are what over six foot aren't they but uh oh yeah they're all they're all huge guys i mean a small guy would be about six three and and two hundred and some pounds yeah Rypien Rypien you know for a quarterback Rypien was six i think he was six three or four and two thirty which is really big yeah he's he's one of the taller quarterbacks you know most quarterbacks are only about six foot um-hum but but uh he's one of the taller ones yeah uh well uh what team what team are you predicting uh will come out of the AFC next year huh you know that's a good question you think Denver will be as tough as they were this year well they might be i haven't really heard who they been uh trading or anything but uh they're usually pretty good right up near the top and so are the Raiders so it's gonna be tough they always have a tough time with the Raiders so yeah other than yeah well i was real surprised uh that they did as well as they did last year i didn't realize that they were as good as they were and actually i thought they probably should've beaten Buffalo yeah um-hum in the uh title game but oh yeah i i think what one of their problems is is they they get overconfident in the second half they get ahead in the first half and the second half they just kind of blow it you know um-hum and they've done that every season every year for a while um-hum you think Mecklinburg is gonna hang around for another season or is uh oh he's getting up there in the years i don't know if he's gonna stick around or not you know yeah didn't they have a guy on there uh the wasn't a uh deaf player on there this year uh yeah yeah it's that uh i can't think of his name now but he's on defensive was it Davis Davis or something like that yeah he's on defensive he's supposed to be pretty good though so yeah i think he isn't he from Nebraska yeah i think so yeah uh what kind of college teams do you like uh i really don't even keep up with the college teams that much you know Cornhuskers right uh-huh i'm just basically pro teams you know basically yeah i kind of run out of steam uh until right near the the bowl games with all the colleges then i then i watch all the bowl games but yeah yeah yeah does your wife let you watch uh plenty of football uh oh course uh now i get Sunday and Monday nights Sunday afternoon and Monday nights are reserved for me really oh really that's pretty good yeah i usually uh i'm getting more and more into that habit but after ten years i still haven't been able to get into the habit of of just having that time reserved but yeah well last year last year was pretty good i got she cut me a lot of slack so i could actually watch some football well i kind of let her watch every now and then i'll let her watch her shows and then when her shows are over i'll turn it to the last quarter like on Monday nights um-hum so what do you think of the instant replay rule i think some of it's pretty good and some of it's not so good you know i kind of go either way on it uh-huh what i can't believe is you know there are certain plays i guess that they don't use a instant replay on yeah and you'll see you know the most flagrant you know foul or something else you know and uh they just don't you know they don't do the instant replay and then on the other things you know a touchdown pass or something like that you know they always get out the instant replay and call backs oh yeah that's kind of yeah that's just like a couple of them instant replays they did they were over their two minute limit and stuff this last year and i think that's what's gonna hurt them from having it um-hum yeah yeah but uh but i don't know Dallas is coming up pretty good they did pretty good last year which yep well yeah they really uh they really mauled the Skins  uh well i'm not sure how it is in Georgia but in in Pittsburgh the rate the crime rate really is not very high at the moment is that is that true for for Atlanta Atlanta is kind of high uh it's it's lower than it has been in the past uh i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher yeah i that's that's probably not true only for Atlanta but for just about anywhere yeah uh what kind of crime problem do you usually run into any pacifits well uh from least what from what's on the news uh there are very few like actual robberies reported uh uh of of residences what's more likely to occur is uh robbery of uh you know knocking over a a small store or a car theft you know it things of that nature very few uh you you assaults although on the college campuses uh there are uh cases of you know like people getting machine from a from an automated teller and you know somebody trying to to device a scam for for uh getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners um but mostly petty things and nothing nothing nothing nothing really too big right well i guess here we run into that sometime but i guess a lot of crimes are done with uh apartment type break-ins you know right that type not much home break-ins there are some but not not very high uh as far as tellers and things like that it's not extremely high either there there were one case where uh this one guy uh was taking women from the teller and and you know making them give him money and stuff and then at the same time raping them also so it's kind of like a double assault there um-hum yeah uh a strange case that uh that happened lets about about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine really it was a freestanding machine and they backed up into it with a truck and put it on the back and drove away with it um-hum oh wow now there's a crime for you there is a crime yeah but uh i guess most of the things that happen around here are are pretty uh innocuous although uh from what i hear in the news and and i i saw saw an episode of the TV show Cops uh-huh uh one time that was in Pittsburgh and uh it it it did surprise me because you know they were doing drug arrests and thing and things like that but i i don't really think those things happen happen too often because like like i said from what's reported in the news at least it's it's not all that common oh okay hm i don't know crime situations here they like i say a lot of a lot of cases is usually just apartments and and break-ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs yeah or drug related you know in in most cases it's not like uh if someone do steal a a television or VCR or something like that it is for drugs you know because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se you know you gonna only get ten or fifteen bucks for it yeah so you really not making a sizeable profit so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that you know even though it it does exist you know i i just to diverge a little bit uh i live in an apartment right now i'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and uh the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in but even so it i mean it's it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to to like lock the doors when they go out you know and things like that right yeah um-hum uh it it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just you know sit out back take a look at when people are here when they're not just come in um-hum you know there's a TV and a VCR and they could uh they could get in pretty easy and especially uh since there are bedrooms upstairs and people leave the door open you know while they're upstairs playing music it it could still happen then um-hum yeah that's true but you be surprised also how much people watch you that even uh uh participating in any type crime i guess there was one case i was surprised uh so happen this person worked at the same place i work for Georgia Tech and they work at the same place i did but i didn't know that they had been watching me because i was getting ready to go in my car one morning and the first thing they said is uh you must don't have to be to work at eight you know like shock  well so uh what do you think about uh uh how trials in America are right now with the jury of nine or twelve do you think that's fair well um i believe a trial by twelve uh peers is fair i don't think the need for a unanimous vote is fair um-hum nothing in our world seems to be by unanimous vote uh-huh except that hm we're too uh diverse a cultures i believe to make a complete agreement um-hum so you think that um majority rule majority rule is good enough for um deciding on a verdict of guilty or not guilty i do um-hum i really do um something that's kind of interesting is uh i lived in Europe for a while and um in Germany they don't have trial by jury they have trial uh by usually three judges and uh i've discussed with people and it's it's kind of interesting uh kind of an interesting concept it sounds strange at first not to have a jury by your peers but then um the argument for it is that um you know people off the street really don't know much about law i agree with that and yeah and and then uh i guess the argument is that they're easily influenced you know by by tricks by lawyers you know who dos do more psychology than trying to teach them what's right and wrong and the law they they use uh you know techniques to sway their feelings whereas professional judges um you know know the ins and outs of the system better i agree i think that's very true i'm um concerned that when we uh sentence a uh a criminal to for a certain amount of years that we don't really know what that means um-hum you know ten years may mean one year in reality right and i don't think that most people are aware of that um-hum you know i i wouldn't couldn't tell you if we sentenced someone tomorrow how long he'd actually be in jail uh-huh could you no me either no couldn't and i think they kind of depend on that these criminals right yeah definitely i don't know i think the that the um alternative is something interesting to look into uh but it if you you know instead of instead of juries just by by uh uh peers juries by professional judges um-hum um but i guess uh that would take a major constitutional change here definitely would but i see where they would be experts right um i mean i see also how they were you know when they made the constitution they were uh afraid of that kind of thing that you know that um if the um government has all the power to decide who's guilty and who's not they wanted to make checks and balances against that right it could really throw the checks and balances out of whack what if one of them is corrupt right exactly and he is the the decision the the main decision maker right you know the the they're split either way yeah it's uh does carry an implicit danger with it that way it does but that's kind of goes like our Supreme Court in a way right that's true too you know how does how does that work and who gets to point those people the politicians right so they get to make the decision not the people exactly i think it was i think it was more of a danger you know in the seventeen hundreds when um really you know like the King of England could decide who's guilty and who's not guilty i could see how they would wanna protect against that so i think the danger is less today would be less of a risk of you know uh corrupt judges and the government forcing um-hum uh you know someone to to be guilty for uh even though they're not or vice versa you know um but it's definitely something that would have to be watched very closely if they decided to do it that way that's true i think a good start would be maybe some uh simple basic education into how the process really works for children exactly um-hum on up i mean i know i know that we all learned but i really don't see it where the children are learning it nowadays right they think it's a big game and you know right and and um you know what what does jury duty mean not not many people really are are you willing to take off from work and lose a day's pay or a week's pay uh-huh is your boss willing to let you right that's that's a really interesting issue too and um you know most people yeah another interesting thing is you know most most most people try and get out of jury duty right oh definitely so the people that actually become juries are it's not really just a random sampling of the  so Cathy um do you keep a monthly budget well we we do of sorts it's not a it's not a family budget both my my husband and i work and what we do is basically treat each income as separate uh partly we didn't want to fall into the trap of arguing over the family money oh yeah well you know i earned this much and therefore i have the right to spend that and well you know you overspent the the total budget this way each of us knows what's in our own bank accounts um-hum so you can if you want to write a check for somebody's birthday present you don't have to worry about the other person seeing it that sort of thing but uh what's unique is that uh my husband keeps a spreadsheet of uh the income and he submits a bill to me every month an itemized bill and i pay that wow and then so he has track of both of our expenses i pay part of the utilities he pays part of the utilities it takes a little bit more work but it does work for us i mean it it really does work very successfully for us hum do you have any kids yes i'm i am juggling one right now on my lap uh we have a uh almost one he he'll be one on on April second you can hear him and the one is four and he's off taking a bath so uh yeah we've got two kids and uh well i can hear him right there so how does that work into your budget uh well what as far as planning for expenses and so forth well in terms of of immediate expenses like clothing um i purchase those out of my income and i get reimbursed fifty percent of that by my husband so again i submit bills to him receipts to him uh for the day care uh what we do is actually take that directly out of my income um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so um that that helps for for that planning hum until they you wouldn't happen to work for Liberty Mutual would you excuse me no no no a a biotech company as a matter of fact Liberty Mutual okay that that's my company and that's exactly what we have yeah and it it works out it works out really well now in terms of long term like college expenses uh right now we don't have something that's set up that's labeled college we have uh more along the lines of um uh sort of investment plans in each of the children's names um-hum and they were set up as as first birthday presents or or or even newborn presents from the grandparents just the the actually assembled and set up uh all the investment decisions are are now ours but in terms of retirement that's the one area that that is is still a little sticky because you you you sort of have your retirement plans through your companies and we spent so much time trying to to make sure that the boys are okay that and you know for our own retirement there's not a whole lot actually organized but we do have uh the things through our companies so that's that's a start anyway um-hum yeah this is uh the first year that actually the first month that i've actually instituted a budget uh for my wife and i um-hum for the previous nine years or so we've just pretty much let it slide um there really wasn't much problem as far as income versus expenses uh things are getting a little bit tighter uh we bought a house last year we bought a new vehicle things that which weren't a problem before have have all sudden noticed our cash flow is starting to decline a little bit um you know with all the monthly bills and uh uh so far it's working out pretty well you know we're keeping an eye on what we spend each week but like i said being one of the first months we really won't know for a few more months down the road how well we're doing um but your plan where you you submit bills that's the most itemized plan i've ever seen or heard anyone talk about as far as married couples yeah well it's not it's not actually too bad once you get the spreadsheet the spreadsheet set out by my husband has categories for things like utilities uh you know other expenses interesting uh the rent and my contribution i don't make as much financially as he does um-hum so my contribution is prorated it doesn't come it doesn't come fifty percent out of my pocket when i don't make fifty percent of the income uh you know which is nice it's fair fair enough uh so actually what it what happens is that we gather all the bills and then write them down and then uh well uh after that it's just a question of putting them into the computer and the computer generates you know i mean it it takes the percentage that's necessary and he prints out a bill and i write a check and that's it um once it's set up it works it works reasonable well so it it most of my friends though when they find out about it they they they think your husband submits a bill to you that's that's that's weird that's really weird but we don't i mean i  yeah Jonathan uh you you say you say it's near and dear to your heart buying a car is uh something you're contemplating i take it uh fantasizing about can't do it right now our situation is that we're a two car family ah uh-huh and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago it's got a uh five year loan so that's still got a couple years to run uh uh-huh and the car i get to drive is a uh Nissan Sentra that's gonna be ten years old next month so wow you get i think about uh sprucing that up in a couple years when i can uh-huh what do you think you'll uh what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next well since i just turned forty i'm thinking about a forty year old man's car's something uh something real sporty but uh realistically with uh um-hum uh-huh the need to take the kids to school probably have to have something that uh wouldn't wind up putting their knees in their throat when they sat in the backseat something a little seating room right uh-huh how about you well i think the next car we get will probably be a well i i like Buicks we have a Buick Century now it's a nineteen eighty seven uh-huh and uh whatever i get i wanna have uh air bags uh both driver's and passenger side and a four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody to you know rather than have them stoop down to get over so i think the four door is probably a major requirement and other than that uh you know reasonable cost and sure safety and uh as much economy as you can get out of a car uh you know i'm not looking for one with a great big engine uh something that'll carry it around safely i guess is best best way to describe it sure right now we've got a V-6 in it and that seems to be just fine i know they said they're coming out with some V-8s now and i think that's probably a little overkill for this day and age yeah i'm surprised to hear that the V-8s are coming back uh they've got some pretty powerful 6s um-hum and uh you know V-8s seem to be a return of the days of you know ten or twelve miles a gallon right i uh i drive a a truck a Ford truck i i like trucks because they're spacious and it's handy to haul things uh it's not related to my business i just you really use it basically for transportation but there's so many occasions when i've had to move some members of the family or do this or that it's it's handy to have a truck and not have to borrow one sure is uh traction much of an issue for you up there terms of traction uh not really um you know it's a two wheel drive truck and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive i probably ought to be home anyway actually uh pretty good way of looking at it yeah we uh we had a small accident with our mini van wow a few years ago a case where there was a sort of freak ice storm and we weren't aware of it and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car and hm this is a rear wheel drive model so we got some monster studded snow tires after that haven't had any problem since uh-huh what kind of what make is the mini van it's a Mazda Mazda i see and uh we're pleased with it in terms of comfort and uh driveability fuel economy isn't great being a minivan but uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others and uh-huh right it's uh got some nice features in terms of being able to remove seats and flip them around so we've been able to do some real creative uh load hauling when called upon um-hum one of my sons has a a Plymouth uh van or you know uh uh that same type of thing the Voyager i guess uh-huh right and uh they have a a child that's five years old and it's really handy for hauling him around and and their stuff and of course as he gets friends i'm sure that'll be even handier so i know if we were if we had kids still at home we're in our fifties now but if we had kids still at home we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value yeah i think that we're gonna be uh owning a mini van for some years to come probably till the kids are out of uh high school anyway uh what about uh all wheel drive is that something that you'd be interested in or is that a not an issue uh i'd be satisfied with a a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the Sentra um-hum and even as as light as that is with uh the small tires it's it's done pretty well in winter uh again like you if conditions are are that bad i probably don't wanna be driving anyway uh-huh right so i know i'd be happy with a a reasonable uh four door you know again we've we've got the same issue with getting kids into the  okay looks like we're ready to go capital punishment uh the problem i have with capital punishment is that uh uh it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime but i don't think that it really actually does that i don't think it deters anybody because most of the time crimes are uh are committed without without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that uh stop and think and say well maybe i shouldn't do this uh because uh i might get the gas chamber or something like that they worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it and uh how about you well i think that in some cases it is warranted especially uh-huh i do too yep and i don't i think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not uh-huh yeah you still have to do it i i i mean i mean i'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer or um-hum so you're in you're in favor of capital punishment then well for some things i think for serial murderer it is warranted because if a person right um-hum who would do something like that in cold blood um-hum needs to be punished or uh eliminated from society i mean you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison right and then do it all over again um-hum and do it again and i don't think that that rehabilitation is effective right have to agree with you and i'm kind of in in favor of capital punishment also i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because uh you still see them committing the same crimes but i tend to agree with you that uh we should have it i just i don't know that it's always effective but i guess we uh we're kind of stuck with it it's it's a difficult uh problem isn't it to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime uh but then you know i think that that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment you know just like for example um um-hum you know you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands who abused them and i don't think that would really warrant capital punishment um-hum right um-hum um-hum huh do you think they should be punished at all or uh like go to prison uh because they're not really a danger to society it was almost really self defense isn't it in a case like that um it is to a certain extent but um-hum i think i don't know because i know they put uh put them in jail sometimes i guess uh i think in certain and it just would depend upon the circumstances and and the extent of the abuse and and if another alternative was available um-hum um-hum um um-hum you know now i wonder what you think about this and uh unfortunately we we don't get to do it but uh it used to be a long time ago i guess in Biblical times when they had punishment if somebody did something for example to your family then you had the right to administer the punishment so if somebody killed somebody in your family then you had the right to uh if that person was caught and found guilty you had the right to uh execute that person and i know that uh if somebody had done something to my family i would feel that i had the right to to get revenge on them and uh but i i don't think that's done much anywhere that's kind of drastic punishment well i think that would be kind of drastic punishment right and might make you feel better but but one thing i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation um-hum then that chance should should be investigated right but like i said if if someone is is just pathologically um-hum going to murder people no matter what then i think they should be eliminated from society right uh-huh right because they are a danger to everybody else huh that's interesting i have to uh agree with that there's a lot of folks probably that are in prison that uh that aren't really a danger to society huh and uh but and a lot of people that are a danger to society that aren't in prison right right probably more of them then the other way around huh interesting i don't i don't not sure i i'm in Washington D C or at least very close to it i'm not sure what kind of uh capital punishment we have here well i know in North Carolina we do have capital punishment and i'm really i'm from South Carolina um-hum  so how do you uh so it so it sounds like you've got a television going on there so i can assume that you probably watch TV news is that i almost never watch TV news i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio really wow uh what what station do you listen to uh it's a local radio station it's called uh KLIF cliff cliff i see so um it's not affiliated with anything is it not not a network station okay yeah because i i listen to uh public radio a lot and they have no no they have KCRW which i i i saw a thing recently they may be trying to start their own uh cable TV outlet i guess they're getting a little getting a little feisty now well this has this station has a lot of just ongoing news uh and occasionally in the morning i'll pick up something like uh CNN or that but i hate watching the like ten o'clock news or yeah so you have a paper or something or yeah we have a local well we have uh Dallas Morning News which is the big paper in Dallas we read it i read it pretty much um-hum yeah from cover to cover how do you like it it's been it's been a while since i read the Dallas news i uh fact last time i read the Dallas Dallas news i was in Arkansas uh the Times Herald went out of business here oh yeah and so we really only have one Dallas newspaper and one Fort Worth newspaper well that must be pretty bad so how did that happen anyway uh financial trouble no not how i mean when did it when did they yeah oh when did it happen i guess they closed down about three months ago oh really huh so how do you keep up oh me i um good grief i read the Times Los Angeles Times there's uh quite a task if you've ever run into one they're uh specially yes they're very voluminous yeah they're thick um if there's something you want to know it's it's in the Times and then in in detail um they uh we we used to have two papers here in town and then the Herald Examiner collapsed about two years ago because of oh i don't know just just nobody was buying it really so there really is only one major LA newspaper now yeah pretty much um there used to be in fact i think there still is the uh the Daily News which runs out of the San Fernando Valley and um they're not bad as far as a uh you know as far as a local paper goes in fact it was kind of weird because i met the uh i met the i met the editor uh while i was on uh while i was doing jury service in Santa Monica one time it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff he was a really cool guy um you know went to Columbia University and all this stuff and uh it's it's a pretty good paper but um you know it's not the it's not the Times yeah although i see you know i'm starting to see some of their um there's there's a daily new uh news rack right around the corner from where i live which means that they're they're expanding i guess but uh and and occasionally i i pick up like Time magazine or something i think uh if they've got an interesting lead story but you know it's i i don't have time i used to read Time magazine a lot but i don't read it much anymore yeah that's that's kind of a problem for them there's a lot of people who fall into that category and then we have a local rag here in town that i pick up periodically and read just to see what's going on in our little community uh-huh i see because we don't get an awful lot of coverage in the Dallas Morning News yeah the big dailies don't like to don't like to step much out of their uh out of their home turf i have to admit the Times is kind of provincial too it's basically anything that's south of downtown they don't bother to cover now they have started here running a three day or three times a week Plano section uh-huh and it's just sort of a you know four or five pages that covers what's going on in Plano but it's still not an awful lot of news yeah i know i uh it was it was a big discovery when when the Times when the Times found out there was a place called Orange County i mean the way they i mean the way they've been handling it before they practically they practically acted like their reporters needed shots to go south of the LA county border oh i would imagine in uh you know in Dallas they have plenty happening in Dallas to cover that it gets hard covering all of the suburbs suburbs and of course they tend to cover the county and we're not in Dallas county so they tend to ignore places outside of the county yeah oh really yeah yeah i i i find that attitude kind of arrogant though it's like you're taking our money but you're not bothering to cover things that are interesting to us yeah  i guess i'll give my opinions here first okay uh in terms of taxes here i guess uh i feel like we are paying an awful lot of them uh and getting apparently very little for it okay uh especially since uh the things that i think that our taxes are going for are i i guess in my opinion not the uh appropriate necessarily appropriate things um-hum i think that uh uh we should be emphasizing uh things like more like education and less on on programs which are permanent black holes which will never do anything but continue to be uh uh sponges for money um-hum i mean we need to do uh programs which are more on the concept of uh well like one of the concepts they had before was trying to renovate the housing but uh then turning the housing over that now see i i agreed with that one and i'm not very often into those kind of those kind of programs but that one made sense help these people to fix their houses to improve their their environment i mean uh uh projects projects were the most idiotic concept in the world um-hum you had they had no sense of ownership no sense of responsibility like a warehouse almost it well it was like it's just a place for you to stay and you had no uh feeling of of responsibility ownership concern uh in fact it was insulting it was it was almost insulting it was embarrassing it was so embarrassing um-hum that i you know i i i i don't know exactly what the motivations were but basically they were destroyed they were they uh you know people would strew feces across the uh uh rooms you know just incredible the abuses that occured it was obviously a failed concept okay so yes i think we do have problems with taxes um-hum well uh-huh well the uh unfortunate truth is that no matter what sort of a program or whatever that uh gets put out there and made available by the taxpayers' money um-hum there is going to be someone who will abuse it they will find a way people are very creative especially those that are on the public dole and want to be there uh they can be very creative in their in their abuses and not surprisingly some of the worst offenders are the people who are inside the system and are in a position to know exactly where the red flags would be what they can get away with uh i happen to work for an assemblyman at one time and i saw abuse of power there uh really subtle um-hum but it was still there okay uh the man was not a millionaire uh however he could have never gone to work again and lived comfortably um-hum and uh he owned a lot of low income housing for which he got considerable government aid right refurbish it and and it was all legal oh sure yeah and oh doing a public service and like like i say you're right in that we're paying an awful lot well not really comparatively to right other countries uh other countries especially European countries they pay a larger percentage than we do but the things that they get in return are more tangible um-hum to the common person national health care uh education systems that you know that's one of mine own pet peeves is how can how can our teachers be so damn efficient well if it's nothing okay that they can teach our students in a hundred and eighty days what it takes Europe two hundred and forty days to teach you know how can they be that good come on come on right well i uh then what it really comes down to the fact that uh uh we don't have enough balls to actually make these programs work um-hum uh well part part of the symptom symptom of a democratic system system is that it it kind of uh freezes itself up you very seldom able able able able to do anything that's strong on either side whether it be left or right right i mean i mean sometimes i say you know even though i tend to go with the with the conservative line i sit there and i say you know at least if we did something it would be better than what we do now oh yeah um who it was Ross Perot was speaking in front of the National Press Club and he was talking about how people in the government say well you know we've got a hundred and eighty billion dollars in fraud and mismanagement okay um-hum a hundred eighty billion dollars a year just sort of going out of window and why don't they do anything to stop it well it'd cost a billion dollars to track all the fraud and mismanagement well guess what i think that's a really good return on investment don't you right yeah oh yeah a billion versus a hundred and eighty billion  what well what kind of job do you have well right now i'm just working um temporary just for a week or so at a uh communication center uh-huh and so basically i wear um i can wear casual dress or casual pants oh okay i don't really dress up a whole bunch but is is that because you're a student or oh no um i'm i've just been at home for a while and so i'm oh okay okay just well i'm a student that's why i was asking and uh i um oh that i haven't been working this semester uh-huh so i don't really have uh much to say about that but i do work in the hospitals once a week um i don't get oh they have really strict clothing rules don't they yeah i have i wear a uniform a nursing uniform um-hum so i don't really have much choice yeah i went to school with some nurses and the cost of those was kind of expensive i thought yeah they they tend to be pretty expensive they look like they'd last a while um yeah they should uh unless you just buy a few and wear keep wearing those all the time oh yeah that's what i do and yeah and and people tend to use bleach on them because you know you want them to stay white and that kind of deteriorates it a little bit uh-huh disinfectant yeah but um i'm hoping mine my one uniform will last me a long time until i have to start working more days yeah and there's not much of a selection at least in my price range like styles or things so yeah they seem to all be all the uniforms even like in the fast food and everything i mean they're the it's just different colors it seems like yeah they're all kind of alike so um i i used to work in a dentist office and there i had to dress up and oh you did yeah and i usually wore a dress most of the time or dress pants and oh okay that gets expensive yeah that sure does yeah were you a receptionist oh okay uh-huh i mean sometimes i think it's cheaper to stay home than because at home i just wear like joggers or Levi's or you know whatever comfortable and i don't care what people think yeah definitely uh-huh that sounds good right also the shoes are expensive that uh-huh and to find ones that are comfortable you really have to pay yeah that's really tough before i went back to school i worked as a uh yeah what do you call it can't even remember it's been so long um office administrator or whatever it one of those titles oh wow like an office manager like uh sort of uh-huh and it was more a more of a casual uh atmosphere but i still wore dresses and things like that so i mean it was for a uh nonprofit organization oh yeah so well you always try to look professional but it's just right i don't know i always have a hard time between comfort and looking nice because when you're working all day sometimes you i don't know comfort seems to come first yeah i agree i i really i totally agree i have a friend that has a knack for looking really stylish but always comfortable i uh-huh oh wow yeah she's really good at doing that because i've seen a lot of people that always look really hot but i'd never i could never make it through a day wearing what they're wearing you know i was like how did you fit in that but and the high heels i i don't know i guess i'm just wacky exactly um-hum yeah yeah well she she you don't have to wear high heels to look good that's true that is yeah she never wore high she's an engineer and she never yeah she never wore high heels just oh wow flats and low low heels and a longer skirt see that's what i like yeah um-hum more of a classic look yeah see that doesn't have to be uncomfortable i think that looks nice it looks so much more natural yeah but you're right i think those things tend to be more expensive yeah well and quality because i don't know i try to find find things that yeah um even if i'm not working that i can wear or else that i know will last you know not just for this year it'll be out of style or something and uh-huh right those usually cost a little bit but sometimes in the long run i'm sure they're cheaper yeah because um also you tend to those things don't go out of style so much and uh i find yeah some of the fads right yeah and since i'm a student i never buy fad clothes because i know they'll be out of style the next season and then i have to go buy more so i just don't buy any yeah i where i went to school though a lot at college a lot of them i mean i mean i've never been one to feel pressured into wearing styles just because everyone else is but i couldn't believe how some of the college people dress because you know i always think of low income i at least i was low income going to school you know and it was like um-hum i know  i uh get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to All Things Considered on National Public Radio uh that is one of my big sources for current events information i i really like that coverage my wife uh on the other hand is home most of the day and she watches a lot of the cable news network have you seen uh have have you uh ever heard of All Things Considered no we don't have the uh national public radio in in my area i can hear it at the um um-hum uh oh the college town nearby when i'm in Stillwater which is about an hour away but the FM signal doesn't reach this far um-hum uh i listen to shortwave quite a bit it gives you a whole different perspective on the news uh when you hear it from say a European point of view or from the country of origin um-hum uh i agree with you too on the um uh the cable channel CNN and Headline News um i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper uh which is why i rely on shortwave and and then the cable CNN um-hum i'm uh interested in the in the shortwave aspect of it uh how do you find that the the coverage from other places in the world uh compares with the American coverage of how do you think that uh the viewpoints differ i think a lot of it is just um the fact that in the US you're so far removed uh in a lot of cases from say conflicts or or it's not happening in your backyard so it's it's more of a um-hum it's not as a personal uh the news isn't as personal in what we receive domestically than than what's on the shortwave it's BBC is um oh i don't know the right word is is almost um they almost take all emotions out of it when they report it um-hum and it just they seem to give more just the facts than opinions do you think then that uh the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts uh very much so very much so and i i think a lot of it is um especially TV news they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to um oh to really decipher the news and to really explain it i mean i you know i think it's important to interpret it but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to to do the interpreting um-hum which uh which approach do you find to be um more useful the the interpretive approach or the straight reporting oh i like the straight reporting um and then i i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it it's it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it um-hum um i always think it's humorous when when the President gives the State of the Union and uh for thirty minutes and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard and a lot of times i don't hear exactly what they what they write into it um-hum so i overall i think i would rather hear just straight reporting one of the things that i found interesting last year during the uh the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against uh Peter Arnett who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting uh some of the things that were available uh there was a there was uh a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely uh a hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory and while he was being severely uh censored and could not make any judgment call on this it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that this you know this isn't a baby milk factory how could he say it was uh and i think that that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the not just the facts but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them yeah i i think people are people have that opinion they they wanna sit down in front of the TV and um or at a read a magazine or USA Today and read in four paragraphs uh and and find out every  okay okay you go first well i have um two kids i have one seven and one five and um they're in a public school here in Tyler and um um-hum i'm happy with it i'm happy with their school it's great good teachers good curriculum um-hum um they learn a lot they have no problems um but i do live in the better and well in the best part of the city though i live in you know the real richy part i guess i'm not but everybody around me is and um but the i have friends that live in the other the less fortunate or whatever you wanna call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and um older and they don't really offer as much i don't know as uh the school that my girls are in i don't really think that's fair you know um um-hum um-hum but you know i'm happy with what they're in so go ahead well yeah it it's it's pretty much what i was going to say is there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in um-hum um i grew up in New York and um the place or not New York City upstate New York wow um-hum and i went to uh the City of Rochester School District and so a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs um-hum and it wasn't we weren't too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system um-hum right and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot of money to work with uh-huh as a result the schools were rundown there wasn't as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasn't as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had um-hum and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools yeah or they'll move farther away to get better schools so you know it it's kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of right also um the the family environment you know you can come to south Tyler where i live and you have got room mothers in every room you've got art mothers you've got every every holiday there's parties all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north Tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is yeah um-hum you know um that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents aren't um you know willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning um-hum you know they really don't have much of a chance at all and yeah why is that huh why is that oh why are you you just they just don't i mean i mean i'm i'm up there at my kid's school i know what they're learning and if they're up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no she's doing fine okay you know um and i i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated right right they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know i'll get through the day and um bring homework home and there's nobody to to sit them down and say you're going to do this right um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesn't work either you know they have to have guidance and um they can't just have it at school and then come home and there's nothing um-hum you know yeah yeah yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education uh-huh i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were um-hum yeah you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course you're going to study and do well i mean that's the way of course are you know  okay so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning gifts products uh not too bad really um i had a razor that i got for Christmas that i just i really didn't want it but i got it anyway and uh it was a Braun and they were real good about taking it back it wasn't a problem at all so uh i was able to get that back pretty easily um-hum but uh i don't know i really haven't returned a whole lot lately have you i haven't had to it's uh the every so often i mean i i i'm almost pushing it myself maybe i'll buy a shirt from GI Joe's and it shrinks too much and say well i should have known better i mean i bought it from GI Joe's and it was probably made in China by slaves um right but uh they uh most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy American it takes real extra work to find yeah right like exactly i was reading and it's probably a Japanese or a Burmese company owning and hiring people in the US right i was reading something in uh Consumer Reports tonight about that as a matter of fact they were talking about cars uh the car issue just came out and about how yeah you'd like to buy an American car maybe but uh you know the transmission may be made in Japan or whatever uh-huh yeah um like i've got an eighty six Ford Ranger and and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by Mitsubishi you know so it's like what are you going to do you know huh yeah really but uh that's the way it is i don't know i i personally feel that uh uh if the Japanese cars are better and Americans buy them you know that's the way it goes and you know people manufacturers American manufacturers should get a clue and you know they should start making quality products and yeah i think they're beginning to the the days of don't buy a car made on a Monday or a Friday are pretty much going away and that's what i thought too until i saw the Consumer Reports issue uh they've got all the American well all the cars all the cars rated you know and uh uh-huh essentially i haven't i don't see much of a trend i mean just like every other time that you look at it the Honda Accords and the Civics are right up there there's nothing wrong with them uh and the same thing with most of the other Japanese cars but then again you look at a Ford or especially a Chevy and they're pieces of junk you know oh know still at it hey yeah that's ninety that's eighty six through ninety one but uh i don't know maybe maybe they're getting better maybe they're starting to get a clue uh wow well they got a three year lead time it probably won't start really showing up until ninety four or so yeah that's just it technology that that comes in right now is is probably not going to be implemented implemented until you know quite a few years down the road but uh hm the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer oh yeah because technology is so uh you know volatile and changing all the time uh and can you think of any other industry where in software they uh if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out you'll get a free version in the mail it's like here yeah or uh maybe they say well you we know you paid five hundred bucks for this program so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade yeah it uh they they keep up good with it pretty quickly and that's that's a real good thing i guess yeah um i don't know and the hardware well i mean all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity and the Macintosh is about the only one that's going it's right forcing IBM and the rest of the DOS world to follow along yeah right they're kind of the leaders right now you know i used to see all those commercials for Windows you know and you're like oh gee they're reselling a Macintosh under a different name really why don't they just say almost a Mac for half the price they could sell more if they were honest yeah you know almost exactly almost is the key word there too you know because i i really i've used both and i really don't see an advantage of Windows at all uh yeah it it's only an advantage for people who had to use pure DOS yeah yeah that's just it i mean that's their client base but uh i don't know i'm really i've gotten a little bit out of the the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home i i do use a Mac at work but uh um-hum uh i really don't don't do much with it at home but uh Apple's sort of making a and they're ones were growling consumer uh need to worry about the Mac they're getting like if you bought a power book straight off a lot of them had to go back they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with the floppy drive right uh-huh yeah you sound like you must uh work in the computer business yeah i have one i do desktop publishing at work and i have a machine at home and i belong to the user's group and i i've been a Mac fanatic since they came out yeah all right but uh technically i'm not actually in the industry i don't work for a computer company i'm an abuser no well that's that's all right but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to you know keep up with the changes as they happen yeah that's true something that i find uncomfortable is you know you you want to buy something say you want to buy a personal computer and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for you know let let's take the example of a modem for you know yeah okay what what what baud rate do you get well you know it used to be that you get a twelve hundred baud  so it's kind of an obsolete question at this point since there isn't a Soviet Union anymore but right i mean yeah first of all i think that we have to agree that former Soviet Union for former right right we we can say the the the the soon to be former uh Commonwealth of Independent States instead is that that that's true too on that one well i i i personally still view them to be a threat as long as they've got nuclear weapons and or other weapons that can hit us and i i don't consider them so much to be a threat anymore in terms of them using it is that we're already starting to see demonstrated that in a very cash starved country you know those things equal a commodity that can be sold to people who i i worry a lot more about than the Soviet Union that that that's very true i i would agree with that also or you know i mean we already had the case where they had those uh guys selling uranium trying to sell uranium on the open market that that part is very true there's also the uh the problem of you know the scientist that will you know need money also and and they can be very rich by yeah and and in fact i i've been hearing suggestions we set a fund up to get them into alternative areas of research at some reasonable amount of pay so they don't go to Libya or somewhere like that sure so i mean yeah so i i i think there's still a lot of threats there i'm not sure if you can once again like you said it's kind of obsolete is it the Soviet Union that's threatening us though right i i think actually you know the the except for the fact that we happen to be due west of them and we got a fallout cloud i don't think the the the probability that we're gonna be involved in the first strike or anything is fairly is fairly high but you know there's certainly a lot of people arguing there right now who all have nuclear weapons and there is also the concern that some of the sovereign uh republics who are a lot of them Islamic some of them have nuclear weapons based in them and if they break off and for instance decide to align with Iran or Iraq then suddenly we're in a very difficult position sure another another problem that would worry me somewhat uh would be that say they were using nuclear weapons on themselves you know in another area um since since there are is some you know disagreements between the different Commonwealths yeah uh you know some very different etiologies in there also it if they were to use them there what would all of our audit detection and what not type systems i mean what what's the chance for an accident in that case also on top of the fallout factor right and and the of course the other thing is you've got them all arguing over their nuclear subs and all of that so there's the whole question whether one of the uh sub drivers is gonna decide to become free lance oh i don't wanna i don't wanna go with Russia so i'm going to uh you know sell myself to the highest bidder or something right absolutely so yeah that that that whole thing is a very scary thing destabulation destabilization destabilization right and let it let it choke on that one uh the uh you know the Soviet Union has been a uh a big concern it's a scary thing right you know the other the other possible scenario of course is that in in it's it's gonna be hard for the entire area to have them but for instance you can see in Russia especially now there's a lot of hard liners coming back because the the economic reforms aren't working we could find ourselves right back in the same position again sure the only thing i think what we have got going for us is we have a very large stick in the form of economic aid and technological aid and a lot of the Republic seem to be more interested in getting the aid in than having the nuclear weapons that that that's very true um you know granted that you know The Cold War was a very scary thing but at least it was a non commodity yeah you know we we knew what we we're you know we knew what we were up against yeah but i i have to say i think all overall overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually stable more stable than they were before because i think inherently our the the chance that we're gonna be involved in it in anything is fairly low i think none of them are foolish enough to wanna attack the United States well especially now that they're divided they're not bigger than we are anymore yeah i mean all of them are looking to us from help not for uh not looking to us for you know uh invasion at this point yeah i i think it is very true uh you know we're once again even the even the ones that aren't necessarily looking for help from us you know they getting massive amounts of help or or wanting that from Germany and from other from other third world countries so that would that would probably also keep you know blatant uh uh you know acts of war out of the uh picture um-hum so you know i i think it it's more gonna be i don't think we're looking at uh potential for anything large scale um you know i think there's certainly some people in in the US government who would like us to think that they're still a threat um you know i was listening to MPR yesterday talk about the Sea Hawk submarine and you know i'm saying you know wait a minute here why do we wanna build like two or three multibillion dollar submarines you know and the reason is to keep Gratin Connecticut at all alive but yeah i i think that there's there are people in government who perceive who would whose job it is to make sure that we still perceive a threat where there may not be one anymore sure  the last auto repair i had was i have a nineteen eighty four Nissan truck i had a a tune up done and i had the i had the brakes done on it and the the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope and it has eight spark plugs and it's hard to to get get at them and plus the time i just don't have time anymore um as far as maintenance tasks that i do myself i i usually change the oil and wash the air filter and i i had an occasion to change the had to change the the battery once but the brakes i was really surprised with the brakes i wanted i do have the background i know what needs to be done and i know the the oil needs to should be changed regularly very regularly and all of the bearings and and and the lubrication lubrication system needs to keep be lubricated and so i i stay on top of that but i i wanted my front wheels i wanted the bearings packed and they wanted something like fifteen dollars uh up front or something like that or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it just to pack the bearings just to pack the bearings but what i found is that they had a brake job and they changed i had them another thing i i let them do sometimes is that i let them go through and let them tell me what let them do the diagnostics that's free okay and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it see right and they told me that my my brake pads were gosh you know seventy percent still good you know but still it was cheaper in the long run and uh so i just got the the the brakes done and i thought that was a good deal and and plus right and they repacked the wheel bearings and they we repacked the the wheel bearings yeah but i've i've had considerable experience i you might say i'm a mechanic a good back yard mechanic and i you know i took auto shop in high school it's been a while back but i i still have a pretty good feel for it but one thing i didn't know is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars i had i had bigger cars and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those but what i was surprised at is that on my little Nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand i have almost a hundred and ten so i drove on those brake pads for uh you know forty five thousand miles and there was hardly any wear to them so those small little trucks and cars like that they they just the longevity of the brake pads is really good you know they've gotten to the point that where they don't weigh very much and the the surface material on the pads is so good exactly exactly so i you know but i i just did it anyway i like to stay i like to stay up on it you know like to stay kind of stay up on it then if you go in like just about any point any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil the oil is you might say a a light golden brown you know it's not dirty i i i keep it that way because that's that is the key to the longevity so right well so so how it it sounds like you've had um some good experiences with that uh uh-huh and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that uh oh um i i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car and uh uh-huh and in fact i have an eighty seven mustang with a 302 in it that i've uh beefed up a little bit um-hum okay and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels um the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were um-hum um not even cast aluminum they were just pressed aluminum you're talking about the vibration dampener well there's three there's three pulleys that you change you change the crank pulley and the alternator pulley that's the vibration dampener yeah and uh the water pump pulley okay so when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things hm and uh probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out uh oh so in the process of seizing the belt spun on the pulley and wore through the water pump pulley almost all the way hm uh oh but not far enough to notice hm so i was on my way to work one day and uh the water pump pulley split laterally in half so there was a half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank and uh so i um-hum  well i think that there's uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day i i definitely agree on that um i'm working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that they're desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever um yeah same here um but as far as what i'd really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could um if there was some sort of provided provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to change to take a shower before work yeah yeah and some place to lock the bicycles up and i've heard of a lot of other companies providing that that would be something to look forward to um let's see another one i'd like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours well a lot depends on the job though yeah what do you do well right now i'm still in school i'm still a student but the ability to oh okay you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that right feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that yeah that would be nice and i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment you're in yeah um i'm right now also a full time student and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm so it's a rather yeah it's a rather interesting uh rather interesting interesting set up work full time go to school full time yeah that can be rough yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that swore to never do it again but i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of um like the family in some in somebody's in the way that somebody relates to the work place how so um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more they get um allowances for um you know have being married or having children i don't really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case well they do but um they get housing and stuff like that yeah yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that right right but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i don't know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how you know here he'd spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places he'd worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing some kind of consideration there would be nice as well i don't know what would be the solution i suppose uh not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place right if they're just gonna pork you in the end um what a lot what a lot of companies do is far as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family in a lot of cases i know that's the case in my office at least yeah yeah they'll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and dependent codependent children not like the case applies to me but um it is nice that they offer it yeah it's a good consideration for families that's absolute necessity in today's world and price definitely and health insurance costs man they're getting so expensive right now i don't have any health insurance it's kind of disturbing unless you you you're not still covered under your parents no i'm gonna be thirty this year but oh wow when you said you were going to school full time and yeah i'm working on my PhD oh that's different it's a long road but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh they've got a really minimum plan and it'll cover you you know and as a student you don't need a whole lot if um-hum if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then right what school is this Georgia Tech in Atlanta oh wow but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that wow and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasn't prepared to pay for it i'm not too sure what i'm gonna do about that right now there's still another six months to go and it's not a pleasant feeling worrying about that right now right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think it's thirty dollars a month so that'll be at three sixty a year hm and that's basic uh group health coverage is there any deductible with that or anything like no  home because i'm leaving from work yeah okay well uh i don't know if i mentioned to you last time we talked but uh i just recently retired from the Army active duty twenty years and of course when you're active duty military you are required to not only to maintain a certain level of uh weight and physical fitness um but you're required to take a what we call a P T test physical uh physical training test uh twice a year uh-huh so we were constantly expected to exercise and be in shape and then we had specific standards we had to meet based on our age group right and if you didn't pass the test then they put you on what they called remedial P T and every morning you have to go to the company and jog in formation in which really did not prepare you for the next physical fitness test but was more a form of punishment right right well so now that you're out of that what what sort of regime do you keep up with what do i do now well as the result of that i really got to enjoy uh long uh distance running uh-huh and so i i trained quite regularly and i i raced quite often i tried to do like a ten kilometer foot race uh once a month or so oh wow now that i am out i pretty much kept with it until i got a job in Virginia and i live in Maryland uh-huh and so by the time i i get up early and drive and hour to an hour and a half here which is about fifty miles work all day fifty miles back on the Capitol Beltway and of course it's dark by the time i get home and yeah yeah so i have to admit that i i have fallen off uh slightly or maybe even considerably or maybe even completely and uh so i am not doing much now which concerns me because i just had my forty ninth birthday uh-huh so i want to keep at it because i know that if you don't uh there's there's lots of problems that you can have definitely yeah and so uh i want to get back at it as soon as spring breaks and uh but what we have done is uh decreased considerably the amount of fat that we consume in our diet right uh-huh and uh how about yourself well i i generally play tennis two or three times a week um uh-huh and that's that's by enlarge about the only form of exercise i get but when i go out and play i generally play for two or three hours at a time uh-huh um so you have a good sustained work out so yeah so that that's that's quite strenuous for that long of a period yeah oh yeah yeah that's that is a long time to have at it but that's of course uh uh there's a lot of sudden fast changes in direction and i don't know does that cause you any injuries or anything um not not generally i i uh the few times i try and play basketball it seems like i always always sprain an ankle or twist a finger or something no uh-huh right either an elbow in the eye uh but tennis is not quite as extreme and i don't seem to have any uh injuries like that right uh-huh the nice thing i liked about foot racing was that uh for me it was pretty much non competitive uh i didn't have to worry so much about being a part of a team or anything and so i could just compete against myself or the clock or the next guy ahead of me right and uh that fulfilled my urge to compete while at the same time keeping me fit right but i did uh i had the privilege of going to what the Army calls our master fitness trainer course which was uh a month long course at Fort Ben Harrison Indiana and i learned a lot from that about uh the difference between aerobic and anaerobic exercise uh-huh that sort of thing and so at least from that i i realize the importance of it right and uh have you noticed any changes since you've started reducing the fat content of your diet uh not so much that but i have noticed a difference because i am not exercising as much anymore in the uh in my heart rate which slowly creeps up as you get less and less fit uh-huh right and uh i haven't weighed myself in a good while but uh uh i just had a recently had a physical and they said that my uh triglycerides and the cholesterol and all that were in in pretty good shape and my wife uh was keeping real close track of it because she uh wanted to see what effect it would have on her and it she showed a significant improvement huh through just simple things like you're going for low fat lunch meats for uh when we bring our lunches to work and uh yeah uh matter of fact i've very seldom uh use uh sugar or salt either uh it takes a little getting use to yeah but uh uh skim milk is what we drink now and that took a little getting use to right but uh we have well at least she has noticed a significant change in her in her cholesterol and uh and triglycerides which is which is good yeah that's encouraging yeah and uh so she's slowly working herself into a uh a moderate fitness program  i'm i'm a student at in college right now so i'm not really in the market for a car i have one though i bought this past summer a used car which i you know hope it will last me for a while um but uh i guess it it fits my needs pretty well it's a um a Ford uh Tempo and uh it's sort of you know nice car not not really you know huge and and a tank but uh big enough so that you can fit people in the backseat so you know it's nice when i go places with other people uh-huh uh and uh and there's sort of an ordinary car it seems fairly reliable right the i i drive a Honda Prelude and uh i i drove it when i was in college i drove a sixty eight Chevy Impala how about you and i drove once i got out i i have i work for AT&T now so i have a real job oh and i and i my friends kept telling me that i could afford a better car but they said but i was happy with my Impala so i drove that for about three years till it completely died and then i got the Prelude and i think if i were to buy another car right now i think i'd buy another Prelude i really like it yeah they're they're pretty nice they're kind of sporty right i if i have the right thing pictured yeah uh-huh yeah it's a two door if i i suppose if i was going out and buying a new car i might possibly buy something like that um but you know i'm i'm pretty happy with what i have now as i said the other the other kind of thing a friend of mine just got a new car got a Ford Explorer and they're kind of neat cars although they have their draw backs i mean they're they're you know they're kind of big and whatever but uh when it comes to sort of um you know moving stuff around which i find myself doing fair amounts since i tend to sort of move about twice a year at this point um that kind of thing thing would be very handy um right but uh yeah i don't again i don't really have any uh you know strong preferences when i bought my car uh you know the major criteria was that it uh you know be something that was rated fairly good for reliability um and uh you know not too expensive and you know decent looking but uh right and i i ended up getting a a pretty good deal on the car i got and i'm i'm very happy with it it's not it's not you know i suppose if i'd the maximum reliability i would've gotten from a Japanese car but um they also sell for much more especially used and i sort of decided that it probably wasn't worth the price difference but uh you know even if i did occasionally spend a little more for repairs but uh it would probably work out now buying it new i don't know if that's true uh you know it probably isn't worth it more hm so you went with the import you went with the import on based on that no i didn't that's a Ford yeah i didn't i mean i i would say they probably are a little bit more reliable but at least on the used car market i think that's uh oh you didn't that's factored into the price already and i don't i'm not i don't think it's worth the added price you pay i mean if you're going for like um oh i see you know say a a you know five year old car um given with for given amount of mileage the Japanese car'll be going for a lot more money generally yeah and especially this one thing i was kind of appalled at is people would be selling uh you're gonna pay a lot more for it yeah that's what i found Japanese cars for you know that had say a hundred thousand miles on them and they'd be asking for a lot of money for them like not much less money than i found say the equivalent Japanese car for with fifty thousand miles on it or something and you know people would say well you know i mean they last forever and whatever but i i mean i have to be a little bit skeptical i mean maybe it's true but hm they don't last forever they they don't last forever they maybe last twenty percent longer or something but still yeah i mean any yeah i mean any any car wears out eventually and starts to have problems so i i knew that you know i definitely i definitely wasn't gonna buy something with you know eighty or a hundred thousand miles on it uh if i could avoid it so uh yeah and as happy as i am with my Honda i have had problems with it really i'm surprised yeah i mean i haven't had serious problems with it but it's got a hundred thousand miles on it now so i you know i replaced the clutch and timing chain oh okay well that's see yeah that's yeah i've heard is it the Hondas where you have to replace the timing chain or the valves can get damaged or something like that i don't know i've heard that with Honda with Honda's it's pretty natural it's pretty normal to need a new timing belt after i think think seventy seventy thousand miles it's one of the did yours actually fail on you or did you have it replaced as sort of a preemptive no i did my clutch and they said you want us to replace the timing belt while we're in there and i said nah hm now i wish and i wished i had later because i had to go in and uh i couldn't i couldn't move the car i had to go and replace it okay yeah i think yeah i kind i think i remember it hearing that either the Hondas or the Toyotas um that if the timing belt went in in under like circumstances you know i guess would it'd be while the car was running and maybe some you know certain speeds or whatever that it could cause the uh cause fairly serious engine damage huh i could be wrong about that it is something i just vaguely remember hearing that i haven't heard um yeah but i i could be wrong about that but yeah i mean i would say in general you know probably although it's  huh um do y'all have a budget okay thanks well um yeah we we do um we've been married for twenty three years um-hum and we have um three teenage daughters and you know they're very expensive so um uh we yeah we have somewhat of of a system um it's it's kind of um you know it's it's kind of hard to explain we've actually gone uh just recently to you know having having two checking accounts we always had just one and now we're having two yeah um-hum um it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal yeah it's um so i have to be that's that's kind of the way i feel about it you know yeah i usually uh my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances and of course we're the like everybody like a lot of people we just scramble through month to month you know and uh yes do you have a two income family or one income uh we have a two income uh family she also works yeah yeah and uh but she she enjoys it you know and and she's good at it um if it's if it's i am kind of uh uh i'm i'm pretty bad about procrastinating and one one of these days i am gonna do something about that but you know you know how that goes but uh uh if but she she handles it pretty well she uh um-hum yeah yeah she writes all the checks you know once a month so your wife yes is that what her is is her career uh related to to finance or accounting um sort of on a peripheral she's an annuity annuity annuitity administrator and so she uh she works for an insurance company but but she enjoys it she likes keeping track of all that stuff and uh oh uh-huh yeah so that's sort of related to her field a little bit yeah sort of and we you know we've experimented with with uh budgets you know from time to time uh yeah but if you know you have to keep up with them so a lot of times we just uh just kind of play it by ear we try to keep our um our retirement and our savings kind of automated so we never see that money just like taken directly yeah it's just taking it out right right yeah yeah we do the same thing yeah and that that's kind of handy yeah because if you don't see it you don't miss it and uh you don't spend it yeah if if you have something to take it out that's exactly what we've always done and we've had uh they've always had um where they match your funds you know sometimes if you if you save so much then they'll match it yeah uh-huh um that you know we've done that too but my husband works for an insurance company and he he has now for about oh gosh how long has it been ten years i guess yeah uh-huh but he was with another company before that but we have we have i i work also but i only have a part time job uh-huh and i get paid very little but um you know i try to use that money for food money Jim gives me a certain amount money you know we just transfer it into my account and then i use that for food household expenses and then i add my own check to that and then with that i try and handle yeah um-hum you know some of the clothes that the girls need and and things like that but the expenses that we need around have around the house yeah yeah so sounds like y'all pretty much do it the same we do just kind of so yeah play it by ear but but keep the the deductions you know coming on yeah we well Jim has Jim has a budget i mean he works it out every month and writes it all down uh-huh um you know i'm given so much money money a month so i am supposed to kind of get the food out of that so i try not to you know we don't um-hum you know i don't ask for more i mean i just try and make it on that because i think when you go to the grocery store you can just you can go crazy with all the choices that you have um-hum yeah yeah uh-huh and uh you can buy you can really waste a lot of money that way so um well how long have you been married yeah uh about five years yeah oh yeah so you're just really getting started so do you have a family too yeah uh i've got one little girl she's like uh nineteen months oh yeah yeah so uh she's she's not uh she hasn't affected your budget yet really not not really not too bad uh no no not like she will later on you'll you'll see that because all of a sudden you're paying you're trying to decide whether you are going to do you know soccer and piano and all these choices that they have of activities to do yeah yeah when uh-huh and then you really have to start saying okay now what can we afford you know what can we do here and then you have to really sit down and plan some more and uh but i think when we were back at your age we didn't have much of a budget yeah yeah and then as the girls got older i think we we did more and more of that you know more budgeting as as they got older um-hum um but um but what do you do do you i'm uh i i work for i'm an electronic technician i work at uh for a university uh Georgia Tech uh research oh okay oh well good good as a so i just uh well we just have yeah we have a good friend that's about to move to Atlanta i guess we're not supposed to talk about those things i better get back to the subject but um budgeting i found you know i feel a lot better you know we used to work out of one checkbook oh well um-hum and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much yeah  what do you think on uh on a scale of one to ten where would you rate yourself on on gun control uh one being maximum control or minimal control most and ten being no restrictions at all that well i guess probably somewhere in the middle i've uh mixed feelings about it um-hum yeah i think i'd be be somewhere around a four or five myself and yeah it it seems to me like there's there's uh yeah it's not it's not fair to just kind of do everything all the same with all guns because they're not all the same you know right like hand guns and guns uh assault rifles i think are a little bit different than rifles and shotguns yeah yeah so well um i ours my families from uh south Georgia and you know they hunt quite a bit so i i really don't you know guns just something that you have down there and uh uh so i i tend to agree on that you know but uh assault rifles you know that's that's made to made to kill somebody you know and you don't need three hundred rounds a minute to to get hold of a deer and uh yeah so yeah i feel and if you did it really wouldn't be worth eating so you know yeah right or cleaning yeah but uh i i've heard some uh talk about you know having like a three day waiting period or something uh if you to try to buy a firearm or something um-hum and i don't i don't have a problem with that you know i think if you've got a if you've got a history of uh of violent crimes or something then you certainly don't need a yeah yeah that makes sense that that makes a lot of sense i don't see uh hand gun i mean it's not like you're gonna go hey i'll go hunting today uh yeah and and usually if you're gonna go hunting it's pretty early in the morning anyway and the store is not gonna be open so right a three day waiting period makes perfect sense to me i guess the only real questions then is um is gun control does it does it work i mean can you enforce it yeah well uh i think it it i mean if you can if you're gonna commit some violent crime and you go and you can get a gun at your leisure then uh to to restrict it would certainly cut down on on that but you know that people you can get a gun fairly easily i would think i mean i i feel like i could get a gun in an hour if i had to you know so uh obviously it's not gonna um-hum uh get rid of all all of your um illegal weapons out there or or dangerous you know get dangerous weapons out of people's hands but uh i think it'd help some yeah they don't i guess i mean the only thing that i worry i question is i mean i think if if it was really easy to enforce that it it would be great the only thing that uh that would worry me about it is that the only real way that i know to enforce it is if someone commits a crime while having a weapon that's not registered you can tag on a couple of extra years yeah but as it is now you put someone in prison and they're out in you know one fifth the time they were sentenced to anyway yeah no time right so i mean they're not they're not even staying in prison without the extra years on there much less i don't think they'd be staying any longer with extra years tagged on there yeah yeah yeah i don't i don't really think uh i mean i think gun control uh to some extent can could help crime situations but uh i think i personally my personal belief is you know as you commit a crime you know you should be punished and and and if you know you are not going to get punished or very little punishment then there's no reason not to um-hum i think you might've had the i i guess i mean i'm that's got to be part of gun control but i like the idea of the uh the waiting period because i don't think that i mean i really think that if someone wants to get a gun to commit a crime they're gonna get a gun but uh yeah if someone is just like all hot and bothered and and ready to go out and and and get someone just because they're all charged up emotionally right yeah that a three day waiting period you're not gonna stay that angry for that long yeah usually not least i'm not yeah i i i agree at least you have a little bit of time to think about it yeah and uh i think i don't know that accounts for at least some of the shootings that go on so in the heat of the moment just go out and buy a gun right then and yeah  we're all set there um okay have you ever been tested for drugs uh no i sure haven't huh-uh yeah yeah i've worked in uh many jobs where it was a requirement to uh for the actual position i've worked for power plants across the country as a nuclear inspector uh-huh and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug test what kind of test do they do i mean just just urine urine tests for urine tests yeah checking for various types of drugs uh have you heard that they can test so far back as say six or seven months whether you've done drugs by uh taking some of your hair um i've heard of that happening i've from everything i've experienced the only way they've ever done it is urine tests oh okay yeah but is that possible though i would imagine it probably is oh okay uh hm well no i've never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that um-hum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh work place work place uh i don't think it's really necessary it just depends on the type job it is if it's a job that's uh dealing with say uh like a pharmacy job or something like that maybe um-hum you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that but uh as far as just yeah every day job i would say no um-hum just certain categories i would say anything dealing with the safety of the public or right yeah i feel pretty strong about that too yeah it's strange i the last job i had up in uh Plymouth New Hampshire it was for an accounts position um-hum and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job really which i thought was rather unusual since i didn't really wasn't effecting the safety of the public at all hm that is unusual but it i think it shows a growing trend uh in the work place to do drugs testing they don't want people who uh basically have that characteristic characteristic in there or that trait in their character um but the thing is that do you think at some some point you know probably about everyone has has experienced drugs of some type what excuse me i didn't hear that do you think that it's possible that uh about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you think no i don't think so at all we we're uh recently at a little camp out with about fifteen people and well i'm thirty one but lot a lot of the people that were there were in the twenty one to twenty four age group um-hum and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs because that topic had come up they hadn't even experimented with it oh that's which i see as a good trend toward the future right is it a pretty large so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right i think in the past there has been oh okay i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties uh-huh um it almost became a a popular thing to just to experiment and try it right uh as far as users regular users um again it also depends on what what what areas you're looking at too right right i think in more in your suburban suburban areas i think you see less of it um and more in the cities uh it's more likely you're more likely to encounter that um-hum yeah that's true well what what do you think the chances of of drugs ever diminishing uh because a lot of it i feel that they catch the people that handling drugs but they're not catching the people that bring in drugs into the country um i think it's not necessarily a losing battle but i don't think it's one you can win i think it's um-hum it's drugs have been around since the beginning of time just about um in one form or another people looking for a way to relax um-hum um unfortunately they're people the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs hm or relatively harmless and also our technical our society has become more technical so that the when you use a drug the ramifications of uh side of uh a side effect harming other people has become more uh frequent hm that's interesting you know the chance of getting into an automobile now a days and hurting someone being on drugs or in a plane if you're a pilot um-hum um well that's true it's pretty uh pretty high whereas three hundred years ago the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse it sure was true uh  so have you heard about Saturns i've heard some about Saturns i don't know a lot about them i haven't been over uh to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the i guess the Japanese cars ooh that's great actually that's kind of the type of car that i i'm thinking about we might get Saturns you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a a Saturn dealer um-hum yeah this this offshoot of GM yeah and uh supposedly they've got great customer satisfaction from what things i've heard hm yeah i've heard a lot of people like them uh yeah i don't know whether whether i would buy Saturn or not at this point i'm kind of my card and uh desires tend to be pretty picky and so uh well like what well let's see i like i like cars that are designed with with human beings in mind and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person whose working on it because i do almost almost all my own maintenance and uh those types of things and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in uh finding a car car anymore that's that's fairly easy for me to work on it just not very easy it's not very almost unlikely at this point yeah and uh yeah i've got a sixty five Mustang and i and i do the work on most of the work on that myself ooh um-hum and when i look at modern cars and stuff like i just say i will never do that with the modern cars it's not worth my time you can't get in there you can't do anything yeah and it's so complicated too i look at it and i say boy you know i i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that well i've got an eighty three Saab um-hum and uh i find that for a normal you know everyday things it's really very easy to work on and so uh now i'm kind of spoiled i used to have an old uh Chevy uh with a three fifty in it and uh i really liked working on it uh-huh yeah ah cause it was pretty easy too it was about a nineteen seventy so i'm kind of uh biased in that and you know i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore yeah and that's kind of that's that's probably one thing i'd look at i think another thing i'd look at is safety yeah that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about actually the car one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety one Ford Taurus because they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual side air bags hm that's a real nice car i think yeah i've driven some uh Tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips uh as rental cars and i've always been very impressed uh-huh with the Tauruses it's a really nice car i think it's very it's a stylish car both inside and out it's comfortable to drive uh reasonable performance and this is out in California where where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore yeah uh i've been real impressed with that you you and i didn't realize that they were putting dual uh air bags in that car now ninety yep then or excuse me the ninety two's the ninety two's had dual air bags this newest model you could get them with duals um-hum well i think that that's excellent that's excellent because yeah but the thing is is that it's twenty thousand dollars actually my my wife and i are actually thinking contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so so we're actually been looking around and thinking about things we'd like to get like a oh oh i don't know what do you call it a dealer return type thing on a ninety two and ninety three or something like that you know year old ninety two or something like that um-hum um-hum sure see if we can those are yeah that that'd be a good deal to go with and the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too because they looked really nice okay um-hum what do you what do you looking for in in those what attracts what attracts you to the Saturns or or or of course we've already talked you know the Taurus is safe but what what kind of things are you looking for well the the Saturns you can get air bags in them i don't think you can get dual side air bags but one of the things the two things that i'm really um-hum i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not gonna fall apart that doesn't have problems um-hum you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the US auto yeah makers when you do that because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability the Taurus is one of the highest US cars um-hum and the other one is are the Saturns um-hum so those two things and then you know we kind of want a four door okay  hi um the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and uh-huh uh-huh because you couldn't take care of her anymore huh yeah she had to have nurses care yeah that's rough isn't it and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home uh-huh wow but uh her health just failed so much that they couldn't do that she needed an IV and things yeah that's really hard my grandma is uh just turned ninety oh wow and she's still on her own oh my goodness and she's down in Phoenix and i don't know what we'll do when she can't take care of herself her her son my dad is dead uh-huh and she has a daughter my aunt uh who lives in another state but uh she has and then there's just the grandkids uh well i'm like the uh yeah i'm my sister and i are the grandkids are her only grandkids oh wow so i don't i don't know what's going to happen with her but she's amazingly strong uh yeah that's what's neat is when they don't have to go into a rest home or anything yeah but i don't know i guess uh most of us uh probably end up there sooner or sooner or later yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and oh my gosh his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed uh-huh and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldn't get up or anything but she threatened that she'd never put that man in a rest home and she never did boy that's amazing that's a lot of stress oh yeah uh she has osteoporosis i don't know how to say it anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she uh-huh hm she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home amazing but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know we'd go visit every night uh-huh every night wow that's dedicated and she only well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming oh i see and i you know we felt really bad for putting her there and stuff she was unconscious and so i don't know a lot of people say she didn't even know she was there but still it was nice to be with her and stuff yeah it's a tough emotional uh issue well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they can't afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for yep yeah that's tough you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just uh-huh taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they can't afford a rest home or whatever and that does a double toll on the kids uh-huh i don't know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but i don't know how we would afford it either i remember one time i was uh i was in a Mexican restaurant here in Seattle uh-huh and uh i i was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and i overheard some folks in the next booth who i think some of them worked at the restaurant they were a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i don't know whether they were from Mexico or or but they were you know definitely Latin American uh-huh uh-huh they were talking about the differences between uh how uh our country cares for old people and what it was like back home and they were just appalled that anybody could put somebody in a you know in a rest home oh really yeah they weren't course they weren't talking about uh where you know you're absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families right where you know the the old people were uh were at home living all together weren't they yeah and uh most people don't want to live that way today in this country yeah i don't even know if i can handle living with my parents let alone three generations yeah God yeah i don't know i and i've been single so long i don't even know if i could handle living with a wife that is a challenge i'm probably incorrigible you know that and you know a lot of people say it's good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i don't know i i would never want to be in a rest home yeah uh-huh i really don't think i'd want to well my grandma's in a retirement community now and uh seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and does she have a home or an apartment  okay what is your uh community uh currently doing with regard to recycling uh basically they're just uh having various recycling uh bins uh located for uh trash pickup uh-huh well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts some some local communities are very active in that uh in that respect and they do have bins set up but i live in a a metropolitan area and uh they're not uh too inclined to do something as aggressive as that well here they and uh live in an apartment complex and they only have one set of recycling bins one or two sets uh-huh as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because you know it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins i i know a lot i think a lot of uh the the issues with regard to recycling are that uh people have to be motivated to do to do something like that because it does take extra effort whether and and i think that and i know Massachusetts has a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably believe it or not is just to get the extra nickel at the uh the store and not uh that's the majority of people that i know of anyways where people aren't really you know ecoconscious it's just the fact that it's something they have to do and i'm not going to throw a bottle away it's like throwing a nickel away that type of thing right they but uh people need to be more conscious of it they're here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it and it's going to create a lot more work for the uh the stores that sell you know sodas and stuff because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything yeah no it didn't it it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans um and and matter of fact i think it took like three tries to for it to go through but and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as uh highways being uh you know people would drink have a drink of soda instead of throwing out the window they they keep the bottle so it's it's been a ecologically sound policy and you know as as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth but more importantly it's recycling reusable materials back into uh manufacturing and that's the big thing i think that they they try to promote right i think here if they uh instead of just you know requiring that you put put out the trash and stuff if they could get some kind of rebate those people who do put the stuff out uh you know and separate it have lower collection fee or something may encourage people to separate yeah that's a good idea yeah there there definitely has to be a motivation factor and i know that at where where i work i work for a defense contractor and there's a big push on for recycling uh paper materials you know computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of uh styrofoam usage because of the uh the process involved in styrofoam and and the whole eco issue and that and and they're very proactive and uh uh matter of fact they give you discounts if you use uh china wear rather than uh styrofoam stuff so so it it it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it i think that's that's what they need to do be more proactive like that uh i know uh i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books uh usually have them come from you know projects to collect old ones usually just get dumped out with the trash and phone books are a large volume of annual trash yeah they they just matter of fact that that reminded me of an article i saw in the paper the local schools you could send your phone book to your uh to with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that uh trash uh the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time a guy went to a dump a landfill dug down five feet and and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they don't they don't degrade over such a period of time well part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper they contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the yeah uh pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them yeah now i think they've come up with some way of uh pulling the glue out yeah okay  are you there i sure am well i guess it sounds like you have children in the background there yes i do yeah what kind of child care have you found for them uh we're military so we take him to a military day care uh-huh um i'm enrolled in a school right now a nursing school and it's just about the only thing i can afford i see uh-huh it is expensive it is and what what kind uh through the military what kind of prices do you pay for child care there forty five a week forty five a week i'm from the Bay area and uh just not even um well known schools in child care here people are paying two hundred two hundred fifty a week yes oh my goodness you're kidding no i don't know how they do it i'm i stay at home i'm a mother i stay at home with mine but i know that it's uh really expensive here oh that is outrageous what types of things have you looked for when you're um when you were looking in for to the child care there well i've had several different kinds of day care uh-huh i had a friend taking care of him and that doesn't work it doesn't no um your your beliefs are different and i i guess they become you you can't um make demands that you can when you're paying for it uh-huh i understand that and i'm i'm not talking severe demands i'm talking things like i have to have you on Wednesday you know what i mean uh-huh right i have an exam i must have you baby sit right um i've had home health care that i've gotten through agencies and things like that um-hum yeah well have the agencies agencies sent you some good people or uh no no they're they're usually badly educated no huh uh-huh um probably poor English that's what you find here in the Bay area a lot of times yes yes and i'm i'm just not willing to expose my child to that uh-huh i mean i i want him to be i want him to be stimulated and interested yeah does does through the military does the day care do they have things like oh craft projects and learning numbers is it is it kind of like a a preschool it is yes preschool only half a day half a day is kind of geared toward those kind of things uh-huh and every week is divided like this week they're doing spring and then next week they may do kites and all week they'll have things about this i see uh-huh not only they talk about kites they talk about the different colors on kites they talk cultural aspects the shapes um-hum hm or uh you know it's wonderful well it sounds like a good school you know i'm uh being at home with mine um if if i do go back to work it you know it worries me to death the thought of uh the child care you hear so many things about it is frightening oh kids being oh Shaken Child Syndrome being kids being molested i mean it's it's so hard to say say you know even with even with credentials whether you can trust them with your kids it is Robert's day care has um close camera watch on the children you know what i mean so it's monitored uh-huh oh that's good plus they have um this is military so they have doctors come in and do checkups on the kids uh Texas what state are you in oh Texas my Fort Worth um-hum oh huh yeah and and dentists come over child social work comes over uh family services comes over uh-huh i mean it's a continual rotation of resources oh well that sounds like a really good it sounds like a good place to to rear kids it sounds like you're in a good good situation with the military it is and they don't change day care people at all i mean my son has been in there now a year and he has the same teacher uh-huh see that's that's a problem with the day care here my sister-in-law has everyone i know in the Bay area except me have their kids in day care and and you know why they keep these people they pay them more um-hum exactly yeah the military i mean they just take care of their own i mean they do these mothers my my um sister-in-law's kids have been in day care and they've switched i mean from one day care to another and those poor kids oh i know they need they need um they don't know what's going on consistence consistency yes they need and they need this person is taking care of some of those things that i can't give my child uh-huh now i'm in school so i'm i'm home a lot uh-huh i mean he's not like one a eight to five job where i'm gone all the time uh-huh but he he these parent people are these women are mothering my child to a certain degree that's so important um-hum it is really important well you're so lucky you know that i am that you have such a good opportunity with um the through the military especially very lucky i have to admit i don't know what i'd do without it yeah my um i guess uh i was surprised to hear the prices of the day care here um oh i know being two two and i'm sure even in some of the nicer i'm not i'm talking uh San Jose area the nicer areas Paolo Alto more as it gets more expensive oh no you probably pay them i would assume you pay them more just because they're overhead in the day you know their renting in these day care places um-hum you know the overhead for the for uh you know just paying their rent in the buildings my sister lives in Austin and she has the most wonderful home health care oh does she lady who does this for a living so she has six children that's all she can have by law uh-huh and  um let's see how about um let's see about ten years ago um what do you think was different ten years ago from now well i would say as far as social changes go um i think families were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um um-hum the the parents usually took out time um you know more time than they do now to come with the children and and just spend the day doing a family activity uh-huh um although i'm not a mother i i still think that um a lot has changed since ten years ago um what do you think about that what do you well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short yeah um but i do agree that uh generally it's society has sort of uh let's see rushed everything ahead um-hum and uh i don't know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations yes what about like as far as um social changes in the individual do you think that the individual has as much time as they did let's say ten twenty years ago uh hm it depends uh it's hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty years ago too um-hum um i just well how how old are you i'm twenty eight twenty eight okay i'm twenty three yeah so there's maybe a five year gap between us yeah so um i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along it's just a matter where priorities are at placed huh yes and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home um-hum and now uh it's pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work do you think it's an economic crisis necessity or do you think that we're we're uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living i think that's part of it too but i do think i mean do you think people really need two cars and no no i don't a house in the suburbs or no i don't think that but then there are a lot of people that that don't have that um-hum that that really do need to work um-hum i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to survive and then there that is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um yeah um-hum okay they think is is surviving which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that um-hum it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive you so you think it's uh which group are you saying is the one trying i'm saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working um-hum is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the uh decreasing um middle class in this country um-hum i think that that's in my opinion the case okay so i mean i have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job okay and then sometimes i i often uh find that so maybe there's so many different things available to us a microwave a VCR a answering machine um um-hum you know a special a dishwasher um a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the um well i guess we're sticking more to social changes but um uh-huh people want all of that and not all of those are necessities right so they're trying to it has become a necessity  so what do you think okay well that's a pretty loaded topic well here in um absolutely hang on just a second the dog is barking okay here in Oklahoma we just went through a uh major educational reform we're uh that was a hot topic uh-huh uh part of the problem had been there wasn't enough spent on education the classes were too large uh-huh and we recently well we're we're through a proposition now where they're limiting class size to about twenty two i think and they've increased salaries and just done a major revision um-hum yeah are your um schools paid for primarily with your real estate tax yes yeah it's just about all yeah what for a typical middle class house uh what kind of annual tax do you pay oh well actually the actually it isn't just i i said yes and it really isn't we well i know it's split federal and so forth we also well no we have a uh an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range uh-huh um-hum they are oh okay okay because um over here um you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year right and um i'd be surprised if we're getting something that was ten times as good as what you're getting yeah matter of fact i'll bet it's not as good right um my feeling is that there you know while there are certain problems where you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesn't seem to be that strong yeah i i do have to tend to agree with you the only other problem with that is that it's difficult to attract people into the teaching profession well again i don't know what it's like on your side of the fence um over here hm um teachers' salaries aren't bad uh they're not executive type salaries although if you're a teacher whose been at it for fifteen twenty years uh you can retire when you when you reach the top level it's not bad at all it's quite good yeah yeah i think that's that's the other thing here the benefits are very good for teachers where um yeah thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think we've managed to squash out of the system um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young right um now it seems that you know now the the joke of the year is you know those who can't teach right and um you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think it's felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside there's a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray called In Pursuit of Happiness um-hum and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system and um he even offers some suggestions for improvements uh one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective yeah in other words if you decide that you're gonna pump another ten percent money in it'll right eventually filter down it filters it's way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level um if you provide other benefits they'll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them i'm not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points yeah that does i i think though you hit the the nail on the head when you when you said it's the attitude more than anything of the teacher profession the teaching profession um um-hum yeah and that that's something you really can't change even with money well it did change the thing to do is find out uh why um because uh you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed um and intrinsically intrinsically the ideas you know um training our um-hum the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh a very um what's the right word um it's potentially a very rewarding not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no why isn't it but well it should be what's preventing it from being respected yeah right right it's a it's a pretty big responsibility i mean to to teach now absolutely absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and um she brings home some interesting stories uh but the thing that you know i i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid um-hum uh i'm just saying that but the thing that changed is yeah um back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didn't do your work but you respected or at least feared the teacher  uh well uh having sort of recently gone through the school system i seem to be younger than most people who who talk on this thing i'm i'm just graduating college graduating from college uh i didn't really perceive much of a of a problem with the school system however when you compare it to school systems like they have in Japan and again you can compare just about everything thing to Japan and we look like we we don't have anything um it seems to be not difficult enough for students not challenging enough and just not generally competitive enough um however i if it weren't for our needless uh competition with Japan i i'd i'd think that that the school systems system works at a pretty good pace i don't know um i haven't it's been um well seventy nine since i was at school at high school and um um-hum i've seen things change i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then so it's hard to compare you know what i mean right but um it seems like when i lived i lived in Chicago i've i've lived down here i hear the dropout rates from the schools and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year yeah and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth hm i mean i i've seen so many different things so so many different bad reports coming out of the school system and i recognize that there are good schools out there i mean somebody's getting getting a good education because we continue to employ people right but um i don't i don't understand the um i don't understand i guess why the schools don't seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities uh well i i don't pretend to understand that either uh but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools but then again i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put um because the the dropout rate is in those areas it's it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and and crime and they all seem to go together and it seems like if you could eliminate one of of the parts of that circle whether wherever you have the dropout rate and crime and you know general poverty kind of conditions that things ought to get better so uh and the other two all oh they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in anyways and clearly to me is a kind of government thing to to fix but it's just like i i don't expect them to know which which which part is best to fix just like i don't know it's it's a complicated issue i i still don't think i would directly blame it directly on the school i don't know if i blame it on the school i think i think i blame it i think i blame it on a couple of different things i think i blame it on the school system um well that's what i meant when i said the school yeah i don't blame it on the teachers in the school i although i think that i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than well they do quite well for themselves hm well that that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district uh were well paid no not all school districts are well paid but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid i mean i know one family that's got they're both teachers and they both have like second jobs that they work in the afternoons they both work all summer full-time and from their teaching job alone they pull in forty grand each um-hum yeah well it it i mean that family is making over a hundred grand and i'm i mean okay okay yes i agree that teaching our kids is important right however these people who only work eight hours a day at it from seven to three and they only work nine months a year and they get an awful lot of breaks in between and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that and i don't even have kids yeah well well well that's true but that there's you can always play games with uh talking about whoa look at this my tax dollars are paying for this this is wrong but when you're talk and there's really not much you can directly do about that i think that that if if there is a problem with the school system uh from my it's been my perception that the school teachers and school officials are not that well uh uh paid that perhaps that might be one area that that could be improved uh where you have other professional jobs and this this is a profession and as a matter of fact it's a pretty big influence on on  what what's your uh you are you into the Cowboys or what uh so oh God no uh no i i'm not i haven't been i grew up in Dallas but i'm still not a Cowboys' man i like Philadelphia Eagles oh yeah yeah that's my favorite team so uh now Randall's coming back next season i hope they'll be do a little bit better they didn't do too bad last season but i hope they can do better how about yourself that's all right yeah well i don't know i kind of go back and forth uh depending on whose really hot and whose not i guess i'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects but uh uh-huh i guess if i have uh my druthers i'd probably go for the Seattle Seahawks i kind of like them oh yeah that's another one of my favorites they're not they're not my favorite totally but i do like them i like yeah they're kind of yeah Seahawks are good they now that Steve Largent's gone i kind of lose a little bit for them but you know he you yeah to be honest with you i i probably watch uh college a little bit more than i do pro yeah i kind of like college actually quite a bit really huh yeah that's kind of that's kind of strange it's too much running for me in in college football i like i like the pros they do you know it's more high tech more you know players players are apt to act a little bit different when they when their jobs and their when it's a job and not just is it you know when you getting paid millions to do it you actually i think they take it to another level but i can see it's more you know yeah yeah that could be yeah grunted out run the ball type college football it's a little bit different but yeah you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then who whose that Notre Dame no i root for Nebraska quite a bit Nebraska Nebraska yeah there's a running team yeah that's that that's boring for me i i'll take the passing teams any day but yeah yeah well i can see i can see definitely how you could get into that i to be honest with you i find that that too much running gets pretty boring as well and yeah it just it's four yards three yards eight yards tackle that's it you know it gets kind of monotonous after awhile i i prefer forty i've asked forty yard flea flicker every now and then just just to juice it up a little bit and right sure well i think they're starting to realize that a lot of the like the big eight teams that used to run so much i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore but yeah it's high dollar you know it's all it's all money now even college is all can we get on TV so right yeah yeah so uh what's a this World League is coming in uh that's getting ready to start up right have you followed that very much or that's that right yeah uh not really i i don't think anything will ever take over the NFL i think yeah it's basically you know it's it's an institution it's like if we try to start something to take over major league baseball it's just i just you know i mean it it it can be yeah it can take over part of it but it's never gonna be the next right it can take over a small market share but nothing really yeah it's yeah it's gonna take a little bit some people are gonna watch it but it's not gonna be wide spread Super Bowl and every Sunday mourning afternoon or anything you know it's just it's never gonna reach that that standard but right yeah i think i agree with you it's it's kind of interesting to see uh to see their claim of you know like world football but when in reality it's really Americans playing somewhere else you know yeah yeah it's kind of kind of strange huh i guess we're the only ones who take it that far everybody else still nuts over soccer but yeah actually uh i kind of like soccer i've never really played it but uh i like the idea it's it's an interesting game to watch that and rugby i like to watch rugby every now yeah yeah or Australian rules football that's some yeah whatever you wanna call it there yeah that's some brutal stuff there that's that's worse than football as far as violence i think golly those guys kill each other out there rugby something else yeah yeah there's an element of there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere yeah yeah that's just wild that's why it's a good big college thing yeah rugby's definitely big in college because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do right exactly yeah that so yeah i could see the feel for that but it's it's pretty it's fun to play i'll give it that it is fun to play if you don't value your body very much but you know uh i don't think rugby will ever be professional but yeah you've played it then no i doubt it you know not least not in this country anyway it's it's it's no you can't stay healthy and do that that's a rough game yeah it is but uh i don't know i i don't know how my Eagles are gonna do this year so you the the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team yeah i my my it's it's kind of odd my roommate that i live with here he's uh he's they really are yeah lived in Pennock Minnesota you know where that is it's it's it's a small town it's about two hours it's in like central Minnesota it's a couple of hours uh west of Minneapolis uh no i don't to tell you the truth i'm okay to tell you the truth i'm not even really from here but uh you just live there now yeah i'm i'm up here for a year on an internship but i i actually live in Florida uh-huh well he's live in Florida like the Seahawks yeah well you know i hey i've i've i've i've only been to Philadelphia twice and i you know i i still like i mean who who who the heck is gonna root for Tampa Bay right really really i mean i guess i could go for Miami but i don't know i'm from i root for Nebraska so i'm i don't have a real love for Miami anyway but i don't know i like i said i i get into pretty much any game that's out yeah but i don't  so do you your privacy being invaded at any time well one of the things that uh that i found to be uh an invasion is when i pay for something with a credit card and they ask me to put my telephone number on the on the uh credit card bill that is something that is not required and in fact uh right it is actually prohibited but it doesn't stop many people from uh from doing it and it's one of the things that it's used for primarily is for demographic uh research and to get the your your phone number on uh uh lists for phone solicitations yep yep there's a lot that you you can still yeah i have always done that i started once i found out that that's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse and i say what are you gonna do you gonna say you don't wanna sell me this product then that's fine i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all um-hum and then ultimately they say no you don't have to put it down but uh really it's part of this compliance thing um-hum uh the thing i don't like i know that certain states actually sell their uh their lists like uh motor vehicles um-hum that really burns me because hey you're required you have to do that right and nowhere does it say you have asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone um-hum and i think that's it it's one thing voluntarily give it because someone asks you can always refuse but it's another thing where it's required by law and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody right uh that you know i don't think i don't think they have the right to do that i agree with you there that's something that uh people have seen oh here's an easy way to make some money but uh i don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not i've i've heard fairly recently uh some talk about that in this in in my state ah the budget problems up here are are pretty tense and people are looking for alternate ways of uh you know enhancing revenue is the uh phrase they use and they were talking about selling the DMV lists and there was a lot of uh a lot of uh consternation about that and the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea but it really makes you wonder what other lists you're on that have been made uh public that you don't know about well that's easy whenever you donate money to someone um-hum they you become put on something like a sucker list and you start getting millions of calls or right solicitations and then you start it kind of makes you feel deeded from doing it again like uh National Public Radio or um-hum any of these the public uh stations you know i i i i think i sent in in money for um-hum once to uh to public uh TV um-hum and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and everything you could imagine i it's like hm and it just started soon after i had done that once and i just said this is this is terrible right um and that's also happened to me where as i've given money to my old Alma Mater in college um-hum and uh it's one thing they don't sell the list but the thing that makes me mad is uh then they start getting uh other people to the people do these phonathons and they call you up right and they actually happen to be people who are graduated in your class or something like that and they say oh we we know you you uh had uh contributed X amount last year can you do better this year and you know like hold on here who how do you know that why why you even telling me this how do you know that is it any of your business i mean it's one thing that i and the colleges knows that that's just our business there's no need for someone who's soliciting should know it all um-hum just uh and that was very offensive too last year the uh Lotus Development Company the uh company that puts out One Two Three was planning on marketing a uh cd-rom uh-huh right with peoples names sorted by number of different criteria  all right i guess well we're recording now uh well the last thing i had done was a a muffler put on my truck and then i usually do my own oil changes yeah my car needs uh an uh i think a muffler but um not sure because i haven't looked at it yet it's just getting louder hm yeah to live in New England oh yeah yeah where do you live i live in Fort Worth Texas uh-huh oh and uh i guess uh so do you do your own car repairs or do you take it to the garage to have it done i mostly do my own yeah i i find it uh more satisfactory and i like to save the money too oh yeah that's true i try to do most of my own to but nowadays a lot of these cars are getting to be especially on engines getting to be computerized and stuff so yeah makes a lot harder yep i've got uh some hesitation problem that uh i haven't figured figured out it's got fuel injection and it's all computerized so well yeah i don't know uh i think sometimes that could be the computer going bad on you yeah and the only way to fix that is by taking it and having them analyze the computer um-hum because we had the same problem on our car hm and uh they took it in and they found a problem with the computer itself because it quit on my wife one time coming home from from a friends house it just quit on her died on her oh but other than that i usually like i said i try i do all the spark plugs changes wires and i do my own tune-ups and stuff uh other than the major stuff i usually take it to the car you know repair shop because i don't have much time to do much anything else yeah that's one thing finding the time to do it that's for sure uh what it did you do your muffler no i take it down to Midas and have them do it that way it's guaranteed if anything goes wrong with it they got to replace it yeah that's that's not a fun job either no it was uh pretty simple really they they did it in about a half hour you know and it would've cost me just as much for the whole thing because it came with a an assembly hm uh it it uh unbolted just in front of the muffler and it went to the tail pipe and it was just all one piece and it would've cost me just as much to from the dealer just to get the the part than it would be to have it done down there so i just went ahead and had them do it hm what um what kind of vehicle at the i got a Nissan pickup uh-huh and the like i said the price of the assembly would've been more just about as much as having Midas do it so it was just easy just to have them go ahead and do it real quick yeah yes a a lot of times the the bolts are all rusty and makes it hard to get it apart anyway but yeah last time i looked underneath it all i mean just rusted to pieces well yeah if you let go far enough it'll fall off oh yeah uh oh but i usually like i said i usually do a lot of my own work and uh the only we've only only had one like i said had one major problem with our car and i let them handle it at the car dealer since it was still under warranty um so uh-huh uh do you do all your own tune-ups and stuff yeah uh spark plugs the coolant changing the oil oh yeah uh i see i had to do quite a few things when i when i bought this car used uh the alternator was loose uh had to fix that and they had the uh  well Julie um are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with uh special care for elderly well i don't know my grandfather is ninety two years old um-hum and he is still living by himself my mother grandmother died a couple of years ago hm but he doesn't want to to move away he lives in a lil farmhouse on a farm and he recently had to have an operation but he just really doesn't wanna go to a nursing home is he able to uh still do do everything himself pretty well well he was until this operation he has arthritis oh yeah and now i don't really think he's doing that well and my a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot yeah but um my great-grandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three um-hum and um died six weeks after they put him in the home yeah and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence your father's grandfather's feelings because um i think you know i think for a lot of people it really is the decision of do they still have some of their life left um-hum and and far as far as i'm sure a lot of people going into a nursing home is like saying my life is over and i'm just here for the rest of the stay and so i you know i guess most of the time when i think about somebody going into a nursing home it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their day-to-day needs ah they can look after a lot of things but there's some of the day-to-day needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore um-hum um i know my none of my grandparents were in a nursing home they generally were able to have someone care for them at home and they died but they were all goodness younger than your grandparents like they were in their eighties that type of thing um but i did uh you know i guess uh when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to do some take care of themselves physically hum but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job and that's that's difficult part because i think what they ofend get used as is uh almost like a very high level or long-term care for uh similar to a hospital um-hum um i know like here in Saskatchewan we have our hospital care well and the care actually for the elderly older people graded in level in four levels and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires long-term hospital care ah generally are not able to look after thisselves to very to a very great extent physically often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or Alzheimer's disease or those or or physical and mental handicaps um you know where they really required twenty four hour supervision of some kind even though it may be minimal um-hum and uh but i think it can be helpful in that uh it gets people the level of physical care they need um but i don't i mean at least i mean i think some nursing homes do that but i think a lot of nursing homes really um are guilty of neglect yeah i think and i think it happens more in areas where it's uh i guess uh a broad social medical system where uh you know there's government medical care and that kind of thing if it it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals and and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding i think that a majority of the places in the US um you know there is some government aid available but the majority of it is to the ability of the individual to pay um-hum and uh if you're not able to look after yourself then you have to rely on  now okay well let's see i see i'm gonna i'm gonna be guilty of not being able to say a whole lot about this i'm not real i don't have a budget uh what i basically am a do is i i have a a job which which i which makes more money than i need to to work with uh-huh and so the money i have left over is pretty much put into investments okay so i'm real guilty of uh of not really doing a whole lot of planning as to how i'm going to set things aside it just it either goes into investment or it goes into things that i want or it goes or it goes uh goes into the bills you know one or the other i just keep a balance on the checking book and that's it uh-huh right okay well that's good position to be in i guess if you don't have to worry about budgeting that what's left over goes to investments so you don't you don't then actually plan that this month i'm gonna invest five hundred or five thousand or whatever it might be well the one thing i've always done is i've put uh uh on my on my uh from when i started even since since the very beginning i always said that i would put five hundred dollars aside every month uh-huh so you always put aside at least five hundred dollars okay well i guess that's sort of a budget then at least partial right and right oh it it is a budget i mean i certainly consider it to be a budget but i was just under the idea that uh yeah i knew i could i would be able to do that and that uh you you have to be uh responsible for your own um-hum uh retirement and welfare and so i said okay this you know i i can do this so i will do that you know so it early you know when i first started in that you know quite a few years ago i said i i know that i will always be able to afford this right um-hum and i said that well you know if i if i start making a significant more amount of money i i would put more into it um-hum sure sure and make a new budget but i've uh it's cost of living has gone up in in with respect to my salary or better so i've actually probably making less money than i was when i started right um-hum okay so although i have not changed i have not changed that number even though you know cost of living has made it equivalently less right right sure well i think that's true of all of us the um well my wife and i both work and we do plan yeah right um-hum uh we try to plan major purchases and we have agreed that we don't spend over a hundred dollars on anything without talking with the other one so i wouldn't just go out and buy a well that you know a i don't know a new computer uh without well certainly certainly your in a family situation you you'd expect a little bit more uh uh you more structured and well that's true that's true uh certainly when you're single you don't have to worry about consulting with someone else and uh that type of thing yeah right i just kind of consult with uh uh me myself and i you know uh-huh sure sure you have a committee meeting of all yourself me myself and i okay right that's right uh yeah i see so that makes that makes it a lot that makes it of course a lot easier um and i've always been fairly conscientious i've never really uh-huh i i don't buy anything really on a whim i do buy things okay that that i want even though i may not they may not be something that i really need but i always find the best price for it and i look around for a long time and and let it let myself get past that that initial state um-hum sure so you're careful rather than just extravagant and just grab anything that happens to meet your fancy right right you know i i i don't just sit there oh i like that i got to get it no i i say now give myself a little time to sit there and say do i really want it and if i really want it then i try to look for a good price for it right right sure sure and then i buy it okay well we do that same kind of planning in that if we're going to get something you know whatever it may be and we're comfortable and have most the things we need or want the but i do we'd you know certainly shop around before buying the new computer or the new VCR or something even once we had planned that that's what we were going to get we wouldn't just go read the ad in the paper and run right down and buy it or something even if we'd planned to get the thing um-hum right my i've always you know that's what what an accusation that an awful lot of people make towards our  what do you do in terms of exercise if anything exercising exercising um i play wally uh wally ball are you familiar with that no i'm not i belong to a club uh uh near where i live or uh actually where i work uh in Salem New Hampshire and they uh it's on a racquet ball court and you set up a net and you play wally ball it's just like volley ball but with some of the rules of racquet ball in that you can use the walls to help put the ball over or that type of thing wow uh so it's it's kind of more fast paced than uh volley ball how many people play uh you can play up to uh four or five on each side which is quite a few people in such a small space i bet um uh but we usually play two and two uh sometimes three uh three and three depending on how many people are willing to get up that early since we play before work uh so we play that a couple of times a week and then i also play pick up games of basketball basketball in the mornings as well so uh that's usually the extent of my exercise it's kind of crazy well i take a an aerobics class three nights a week huh and it's at the fitness center i actually work for an electronics company but we have a a fitness center at there at the building oh really and i take uh this aerobics class which is a great class it's what they call a circuit class where you do a few minutes of aerobic exercise and then you break and do some weight work yeah with hand weights and then back to the aerobics and then maybe back to the elastic bands or whatnot but it's it's broken up for an hour now are these is this what they call high impact or is this no no this is low impact this is safe stuff now is the high impact really that dangerous for you i i think it is um i took a a high low impact class at the local Y a couple of years ago and it just seemed like i was on the verge of getting hurt in terms of knees or back or something like that wow uh that that's amazing i'd taken some dance courses in in uh school and i don't know it uh they seem like they would be classified as high impact but maybe there was more flow to it so it wasn't so jarring yeah well i think the trouble with high impact aerobics is that it's so jarring and you don't with the low impact you always have one foot on the floor oh okay you can get pretty strenuous doing that sort of stuff well see that's the thing i see some of these people doing low impact and i'm like what's the difference these people are really working up a sweat yeah well i think it has to do with number of feet on the floor and how much bouncing around you do and that sort of thing like the class i'm in now does not do jumping jacks right huh okay but we cause both feet can't be on the floor at one time right but but we certainly get our heart rates up huh just from the the marching and and all that that we do so which is i guess the whole point of it yeah i think so now they you say do this at work it it's at a fitness center that's associated with the company where i work yes do you have to pay to do that or is it part of your benefits uh no i have to pay to join oh okay uh but it runs oh i think the class is let's see i pay about ten dollars a month to be a member of this fitness center huh and and there are all sorts of opportunities available there in term you know any anything from chess clubs to flying clubs you think and uh then it's an extra forty dollars for an eight weeks aerobics class and i think it's pretty competitive with most health most health centers and they they have a swimming pool and a gym and all kinds of huh oh yeah of all kinds of the Nautilus equipment i was going to say do they have the free weights circuit and the Nautilus circuit and all those things yes i i did some of that but it the time it takes is just exactly it uh i don't know once i i get through with the aerobics session i'm ready to go home and eat dinner or something so you so you exercise in the evenings yes that's interesting uh i i don't know it my schedule i guess is more i get up at about uh five thirty and then i go and play wally ball from six thirty to say eight and then i uh shave and shower and do that stuff uh at the gym and then i'm at work at eight thirty uh-huh so it's all kind of in the in the in the morning but by the end by mid afternoon i'm like ugh or depending on how the game went it could be like that right after uh right in the morning getting to work yeah well so it it's interesting a different schedule um uh you don't feel more tired toward i guess well i guess you would uh going home for dinner and then you're uh and then you're uh i i'm sure zonked well the advantage is sometimes i'm too tired to eat now i mean they really offer classes in the mornings and there's even one class at noon but i can't really see breaking up the middle of the day going off and doing aerobics taking a shower getting back to work yeah no i know some people who do that as well and i can't understand that either i mean you know i in the morning i come to uh uh work with uh wet hair and you know and kind of uh not breathless but just  you're uh can you tell me what you think of capital punishment yeah um i'm against capital punishment um um-hum i i guess there's a cliche that um for every thousand criminals let free if one innocent person is uh killed that that's a terrible thing for the state to be doing and i agree i remember watching a a documentary film a couple of years ago um-hum um-hum i've forgotten the name of it now but it was about a killing in Texas where somebody was sentenced i think it may have been just to life imprisonment but in any event it may have been capital punishment but uh um-hum um-hum this documentarian documentarian or whatever you wanna say um he uh interviewed all the parties involved and basically got another person to admit that he had been the one who had committed the murder i don't know was that the rape murder of that sixteen year old girl in a school um no i don't think so it was a i don't remember the circumstances actually i i just remember there was something like something like that on Sixty Minutes about two years ago no no this was documentary um it was a a you know in released in theaters i saw it on PBS finally i guess um but any event it was it was very interesting and it um-hum hm hm you know i guess they say that you look for views in the media that support your own and maybe maybe that's the bias here i don't find very many that support mine well what's your um perspective on capital punishment well actually i mean not not with regard to capital punishment i mean just in general the media um um-hum uh they take the the the the the average person in the media is far more liberal than the average person in the rest of the country and so uh views that are more conservative just don't get adequately represented in the mainstream media that's been documented by a number of studies but on capital punishment look that's an exception i'm not conservative on that i'm sort of middle of the road i i lean against capital punishment but i i wouldn't be an activist on it cause there's so many more important things i think i mean i admit that some innocent people get killed and i believe you're correct that has been documented it happens occasionally and it's very that that that's that's quite unfortunate and there's also the factor that that there's obviously racism in terms of even though certain minorities might commit a higher percentage of crimes than they are represented in the overall population they are also convicted convicted of capital crimes and sentenced to capital punishment at a higher percentage than they're represented even among criminals so that's hm well that last caller actually i i this is the first time i've ever spoken about a topic for the second time but the last caller that i discussed it with didn't oh really didn't say you know even that even the the fraction that would be represented among criminals are convicted more often and in fact i just asked him the question is it is it true that isn't it true that minorities you know from people in general people from lower socioeconomic groups tend to commit more violent crime and so wouldn't you expect them to be committed to to be convicted more often um-hum now i do think i recall seeing some statistics to to the effect that that you that you mentioned um i don't know that you know maybe it was a report a news report i heard or something where i couldn't check it out very carefully where i couldn't i i always tend to read over these things you know especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the Southern Poverty Law Project or something that did that um-hum right i think i don't know and so i don't know whether i necessarily whether i wanna give credence to that without looking into it but i do remember hearing that yeah um-hum i think some bar associations um a lot of bar associations are against capital punishment and um this is one area where perhaps they've done some of the work i'm not sure um-hum um-hum um-hum yeah well i'm i mean i i i agree i think that that the problem with capital punishment is that it's irrevocable if you find out you put somebody in jail wrongly you can just let them out if you find out that you you killed somebody wrongly there's nothing you can do to bring them back to life so so that's definitely a problem and um you know well we're supposed to talk about our state i guess according to the synopsis at the beginning so North Carolina has capital punishment well right if if North Carolina didn't have capital punishment i wouldn't try and institute it it it does have capital punishment i don't see that it does any good um-hum they might convict somebody wrongly sometime that's unfortunate but um you know farther the fortunate thing really is that that it occurs so rarely uh i think we have about uh maybe one execution or a little bit less a year in North Carolina now i is that so i know there're some states like i think Texas is probably the leader in the country i'm not sure of that but i think it may be is that right i'm not sure i think that sounds right offhand but i'm not positive i i have only recently moved to Kentucky so i'm not even sure what Kentucky's law is my guess is it's probably legal but probably similar to Carolina that it's not used very frequently um-hum hm yeah i think that that you know most southern states tend to have capital punishment more than northern states and a state like Minnesota for example i don't know but i'd be almost sure that they don't have capital punishments Wisconsin Wisconsin the same way right right right i was living in Illinois before here and i'm virtually certain that they didn't have it or if they did have it it was never used hm um-hum  actually to tell you the truth i think uh jury selection is a uh prime uh discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on uh uh finding of uh guilt hm i certainly can't argue with that definitely does need some improvements uh and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to yeah i think there's a limit on that the uh the uh peremptory challenges are limited to i don't know how many but you can i think it's it's four or five i can't remember which i was on a jury trial last year only i got kicked out as uh the last selection that the uh defense got hm yeah i it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things i think i have a severe demeanor or something hm that uh uh but typically you know basically uh typically uh everyone gets involved in uh the jury process and i suppose an elitist might say well you really want someone who's well educated to be able to to winnow the facts from the from the prejudice right but it still has to be a group of your peers right see so so if it's your peers and you're not educated so if you're a nincompoop on trial you'd you'd have to have nincompoops to uh then you want you want a nincompoop jury because they'll sympathize with you a bit hm as well as hopefully being honest people and do their best to comply with the facts as they were presented to them so that's why the defense is there picking through them whereas at the same time the uh the prosecutors sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him uh a guilty verdict if the facts warrant um-hum so uh i think the jury selection process is pretty neat but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment hm afterwards i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have i mean you're talking about the person's already been found guilty um-hum um-hum right and many times i've seen on trials they have on TV the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever but i think that it should be up to the judge and the uh lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be hm maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is and what it's all about and believe in the system um-hum hm um-hum uh and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure well i suppose you may be right on that as opposed to an emotional sentencing procedure also may be a more consistent sentencing procedure as a matter of fact i've heard that i've heard that some of the information uh is prevented from reaching the jury like uh mitigating circumstances or or preceding uh criminal record or things of this nature that well preceding criminal record according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime but when it comes to uh sentencing for punishment of course if the person's never done anything bad before according to the judicial system then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury oh is it oh i didn't realize that okay at least in California they're supposed to be not during the trial during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background right but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down i think that uh that they should um-hum i don't i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial they get too boring um-hum so you're what you're saying is if if this is the second offense then you execute them well if it's a second offense the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense because obviously the rehabilitation process did not work the first time um-hum so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that'll hopefully work better uh when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing i'm all for that for uh small crimes infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things what about uh white collar crimes like uh theft of trade secrets i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are oh really yeah like what well uh say embezzlement right you get a guy down the street hm who comes up uh carrying a knife  so Rick you thinking about buying a new car um-hum yeah i am uh a truck a truck uh Japanese or American yeah i think i'm going to buy American this time you you this time you had a you Japanese yeah i got a yeah we got a Toyota two of them actually uh-huh they uh they've always been real good cars but it's just uh they rust well i actually haven't had any problem with them at all but um i i think it's probably pretty important to uh to buy American i've i'm coming to that conclusion you know i it's like i'm i've been driving like foreign cars now for for years and i i'm actually thinking about buying a new car i i uh-huh i'm sitting i'm sitting here right now it's like my with a thousand dollars worth of repairs on my car and uh i'm thinking about buying an American car also uh-huh uh-huh yeah um i i think they're to the point now where they're just they're just as good as those foreign cars i yeah i do too i i think uh i've i've had pickup trucks before and i've had uh Chevrolets and they were pretty good but i i think uh Ford um is is pretty much focusing on quality that that's the best uh actually uh a guy that like's in next office he uh he's thinking about buying a truck and he's looking at an F one fifty and uh uh-huh he he he one thing that you find about the about the the F one fifties is that uh they are every every the word is out that they are like the best truck uh especially like if you want to get like you know heavier than a mini pick up and uh they weren't cutting too many deals is that right yeah um-hum with uh with the prices on the F one fifties especially especially like in the in the four wheel drive models um-hum but uh i i i guess like all these people can't be that wrong you know in terms uh of uh of how they how they are yeah yeah i was looking in uh it was uh i i forget the name of the magazine used to be Changing Times sort of like a Consumer Reports magazine um-hum and uh they were saying that Ford Ranger was the number one selling truck counting all now the Ranger is that the Ranger is below the one fifty it's like a it's like a three quarter ton truck yeah um-hum yeah something like i believe something like that and was is and the and the F one fifty is a ton and a half or or i'm not sure where they sit yeah i'm not sure i i i kind of think i'd like to go with uh something around a a one fifty i don't want a full size but i don't want uh one of those little uh mini trucks either uh-huh besides i probably would look at something uh maybe a a V six yep you geing to get a King Cab you know yeah yeah that that that know do you have any any kids or anything yeah i've got one little girl and and and a set of golf clubs so oh there you go yeah you you you you got to have you got to have just that extra space yeah yeah yeah that's it it yeah the uh the it's a a buddy of mine he just he just bought a truck and uh and and it was a thing was like it would there was no thought whatsoever about not getting the extra size cab even though you can't really use use that back area for a seat yeah you know unless you're some like some kind of contortionist yeah uh but you just need it because you do carry you do carry stuff that you you don't want to like just throw in the bed yeah yeah i i kind of like the looks of a short bed but or the short cab but but uh you know like i say just you you just really need the extra space uh-huh either unless you have some sort of a cab you know cover or something but yeah you'd get air-conditioning because you're down there it's pretty hot right yeah um-hum uh-huh that uh although uh i i notice you you you said rust right before that that we don't have that much problem down here but i know y'all have it up there i guess they salt the roads and uh oh boy i'll tell you that's like that's the number one car killer up here is that is the is the rust you know it's like you're you're constantly car taking uh-huh yeah about every other every about every month during the winter you know the smart thing to do is to go to like one of those uh drive in car washes do it yourself and just fire a bunch of water underneath underneath you know up into your rocker panels and stuff uh-huh yeah yeah because uh it just like i said it it just eats the cars like right alive yeah i guess i i as as was working with some people from Buffalo here recently or actually it was a couple years ago but they were they were saying you know a lot of people up there they got a winter car and then a summer car you know that my neighbor's in the exact same situation situation it's like he uh he has he has two cars one of them is a is a a Mitsubishi you know uh uh i don't know what is a Starion or it's one of those hot cars and uh yeah um-hum it's like come come November when the roads like start to get you know to get nasty the Starion goes like into the into the garage then he closes it and locks it and then he yeah he throws he he pull he throws a tarp off of this beater that he's got in the backyard yeah out comes the sixty eight Nova and i think it's a it's actually like a it's like an eighty two no no yeah it's like an eighty two Toyota Corolla you know yeah uh-huh and this guy goes through this like role you know this revert Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde revert  so let's talk about the uh wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it what do you think is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there well actually i don't think they're out of line Devil's Devil's advocate possibly but it you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whether whether or not you agree with that law it you're still circumventing it you are legal in in your circumvention of that law what what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying um income tax on something that you purchase mail order uh really i i i don't think that's a valid argument i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax um some naturally some some things you just can't find in your local KMart or or um Bryn Mawr stereo dealer um but then then then why not pay pay the sales tax to Pennsylvania corporations have to why should an individual just because it's just because the state can't really find out about it be able to avoid paying sales tax well i mean it seems to me that generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania it's because i'm sorry the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania uh it's because i i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area so i go outside the area for that yes and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though you know the revenue stream went to another state i don't i don't think that that's my responsibility as a as a conscientious consumer i i'll agree it it's not your responsibility but is but is it also legal for you to do that what what from from what i understand from various various various net readings it it it the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes um in into place in the next few years it is it is a lost revenue stream right now and states can can use all the revenue they can get with some with something like that will do your arguments still apply well i think that if if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion then i don't argue with it because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh i bought this out of state i need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania which is exactly what businesses do at the present right but the point is is that businesses do that the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question that's a cost of doing business the burden shouldn't be placed on the consumer and i i i was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having having to pay sales tax on it ah that's my understanding of the way um the way it works usually the the person ordering it doesn't pay but the accounting department will uh suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay and there reasons there are some some substantial nasty penalties um if you if businesses try to avoid that uh do you mean businesses from the point of view as of of selling things to a consumer and then being responsible for the sales tax a as if no businesses um if or purchasing purchasing things mail order if i if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these this great deal on forty eighty six motherboards uh from from say Utah um i i might buy the motherboards from Utah but then still have to pay some Pennsylvania sales tax my apartment accounting department will at the end of the month uh i think that i think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania and i know they work that way in uh say here in DC yeah see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't i never see that end of the business yeah so my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer um but if that's the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that um the opportunity for to forget that you owe sales tax for something uh can be avoided that's true is is a real a big hole does exist right now uh in that consumers can just say oh i i forgot that there there is no well defined mechanism at all and and that it is a a a loss i i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism just just to do just that in order in order to gain the revenue that's being lost um and i i don't know if i agree with that but it but  been about ten years since i graduated from high school i got a GED i was a drop out up until that point uh-huh and uh as my memory serves me school was not that um didn't achieve it's goals as being an educational institution very well and i would suppose that the trend in government is for things to get worse kind of like uh chaos and regular deterioration so i don't not having seen anything to change my mind i would assume it's gotten worse in the meantime yeah i graduated about the same time you did and um i graduated early only and i was lucky because i don't think i would have graduated at all i was skipping and everything yeah up to that point and i just happened to have enough credit hours so i could get out yeah i had really reached the point where i'd quit going entirely i was tired of it was off working somewhere um-hum there was almost no challenge to it at all i was on the college track doing all the classes and i was done uh um it was boring they weren't interested yeah i had started in that uh that track but just got sick of it and turned into a juvenile delinquent instead um-hum went off and joined the military and then uh came back to college it just the material was so repetitive it was stuff we already seen probably half a who knows how many times before and it was just presented so dryly and i suppose that if um if you're going to pay teachers the salary that they're paid that's that's the level of education that's going to be presented that's true we have to pay our teachers more and give them more incentive to interest the children yeah um yeah i really i really believe the same thing i mean here i am now just now finishing up college it took me that long to get interested to go back um you know and but i find college a whole different ball game yeah absolutely it's a stress test it is but it's so stimulating i mean those teachers really are at least mine of course i'm in nursing so um ours is a lot of life threatening but um i it it isn't i i don't miss classes i love it yeah yeah i agree it's a whole another class of everything the level of education the uh excitement and the the interesting instructors their level of understanding the material everything's different maybe we ought to um offer this kind of enrichment to our high school students now how would you recommend doing that well if somehow we could make give them a certain amount of independence cause that's part of college yeah right um and then simply say this is up to you to achieve this sounds a lot like the um what do they call let's see uh fire fox Foxfire method i haven't heard about that that's the one where uh some guy it's here in Georgia north Georgia several years ago ten twenty years ago walked into a class room and they the students retained command and he just kind of threw up his hands and said basically do what you want to do and developed this uh program where the students pretty much did what they wanted to do the teacher was just there to kindly loosely kind of loosely guide them um along and to make sure that they weren't getting um-hum getting off into weird senseless subject areas and stuff like that and i think there was some kind of sociology class along the lines of um um-hum what did they do they went out and collected stories and culture of the area in southern Appalachian uh mountains um-hum and published a bunch of books and the guy's real famous now and in fact i just read recently that some school here in north Georgia decided to completely um adopt the Foxfire method all the classes are that way oh really and they say that the results are just tremendous it's a whole another um magnitude of improvement over regular public schools see and that and it works yeah i wish there had been something like that years ago when we were younger me too i wish they had computers yeah they've made a an amazing change i think i think elementary school is educational is stimulating for children and i think we lose them somewhere between junior high and high school a friend here in town just recently helped a um third grader with his science fair project and he was describing some of the interaction um-hum uh between the the teachers there and the students and the teachers there and himself and other people like him um-hum and was really disturbed with the uh mentality of the people there they treated him like uh he was one of the kids you know they had their little domain um i remember he brought up a story about how he needed a desk to set up the uh the science fair project that he and this other guy worked on and they couldn't find one anywhere and they found one in a room and the instructor there was really possessive of it and wouldn't let him use it oh you're kidding yeah well then that goes to maybe not having the funds for things  do you have a pet yes i do i have a dog do you have pet i have uh see three canaries oh i have never been fortunate enough to have a canary well let me rephrase that i've had them but i don't have luck with them is there a secret oh we put uh vitamins in the water and uh we don't take really great care of them but uh we just make sure that their their water has vitamins in it and uh and some of them are hardier than others the ones that are really hearty are the ones that are that are uh how shall i say it variegated ones the the real brightly colored ones don't seem to be too hardy because they've been bred for looks and not for strength oh really i didn't know that so what kind of a dog do you have i have a mutt he's part pit and part boxer but he is a very good dog he's very which surprised me because i've had such um repercussions about having a part Pit uh-huh especially around children but he's really good i can't complain well the i think the important thing uh we've had several dogs and and uh my wife keeps going for these beautiful you know how shall i say it the beautiful dog is the one that catches her eye and so i keep telling her that beauty is not uh is not important when you've got a dog intelligence is that's true now there's nothing worse than a dumb dog and this you know just like a dumb friend so to speak just she what does she like in particular anything particular uh as far as the pets uh-huh um she likes the fluffy ones and the ones that are you know that are how shall i say it they're really good looking but i like mutts myself they tend to take a lot of time whenever you get those kinds you have to brush them continually and that type of thing yeah and and well like i say they're they're picked for they're bred for looks and so they're like these turkeys that you see in the in the uh i don't know if you've heard stories about the differences between wild turkeys and and uh and the ones that are bred for the meat but the ones that are bred for the meat will drown in a rain storm and because they're so dumb and and uh they uh wild turkeys are really smart and the thing that uh when it comes to pets is a a smart pet is really a lot of fun they that's been my experience but uh you don't get them by getting them for their looks you got to get them for their you know how where they look at you with bright eyes when they're little puppies and stuff like that that's true do you think pets are uh handicapped or are they uh very worthwhile having them around and what is their use that was one of the questions i was told to um ask from the operator and i think that they're very useful especially for uh companionship and that type of thing what is your opinion i i feel the same thing pets are uh they add a new dimension they they give you something to think about when you're kind of tired or blue or something like that and uh they get you to think about something other than yourself that's true and they never talk back almost and they're always there when you need them yeah and they uh and their it's kind of fun to rub them and and uh well with canaries you don't do much of that but when they sing why it cheers you up yes so uh and i think that that uh they also give you a sense of of somebody is depending on you you've got to do something for them or or they uh they suffer that's true so it adds a dimension that that uh you're kind of in control and that's kind of sad when people neglect pets but so let's see how how old is your dog oh he's young he's only a he he just turned a year so he's really um just starting out in the world got to wait well have you uh let's see what else have you had other pets beside this yes i've had basenjies also i use to and they've um they're the ones with the high pitched bark or they don't bark at all they have a yodel and uh i haven't found any in this area anybody in this area that raises them to uh get another one yeah yeah so that's how we and we came across this one that we've had quite by accident my daughter found a had a family that wasn't taking care of it and just didn't want it and in the meantime we were looking for a basenji and uh we weren't very successful but uh they're an intelligent dog and they're very uh um independent but they're not so much independent that they uh are like a cat people a lot of people  your turn okay uh i don't think they should abolish it i think it's i think if they put it into force more often they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got but not for petty theft right no no for major things like premeditated murder mass murders uh you know that type of thing i don't think it should just be used loosely well it should be used as a deterrent do you think yeah well or should it be used uh as to prevent further uh crime like yes yeah prevent these people from ever getting out on the streets by you know some technicality and they go down the line ten years and then on some little technicality they get out and they're on the streets again doing the same they they did before hm um-hum and you know you know that's about the only thing and like for petty for theft and and stuff like that or manslaughter you know i don't think they should do that well you know there's this old um Jewish is it saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth oh well well i guess if i if it was someone in my family i'd probably feel that way you know i've never had anybody in my immediate family uh murdered and so i really wouldn't know but but i feel like if i did i probably would feel that way uh one of the things i was thinking about is uh you know from society's point of view if you put a value on each person what you want to do is to maximize the end game value so if you have someone that that destroys that value um-hum uh then what you want to take steps to uh minimize the loss of course you have to also put value on the criminal right so if you terminate him that's a loss of value so you know if you weight everyone equally well that's true then you have to say well the likelihood of not terminating him if if you don't terminate him the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person in other words you'd have to you'd have to murder more than one other person besides him uh in order to justify taking his life okay another way you could do it is weight this value by uh the value to society of the people uh which is pretty uh delicate thing to do but one way of doing it is uh by income so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money which is often times the case then his life isn't worth very much then then he's obviously not worth very much and so uh the likelihood that you know maybe expected expected murders by him is is um integrated over the income of the people uh that he murders is maybe you know a loss of who knows eight hundred thousand dollars uh but if he only uh integrated you know integrated income over the expected expected remainder of his life is um small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh uh terminate older people than younger people since the uh uh integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less right which means well i suppose you could say well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation potential i mean that's the that's the key right there potential um-hum now are they are they rehabilitative or or not huh now that's all fine and well and and uh good philosophically but if you're involved yourself personally um-hum uh i know i have a friend whose uh son was murdered on on the night before his sixteenth birthday and let me tell you uh i i knew them personally uh not intimately but quite well and uh um-hum you're talking about real trauma i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies i can imagine uh the father you know of of course um a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get i think in terms of psychological impact yes yeah um was he murdered did they find out who killed him and oh yes they found him and he is on trial for capital murder hm so it hasn't been a long time ago just recently uh well actually he i'm i'm sorry he uh was convicted uh and of course now you know and you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process but yeah yeah that appeals process i mean it's what you know really you know just drags out and out and out my brother-in-law here in Texas his by marriage my sister's husband husband his sister was murdered down here by a guy in in well actually in Houston and uh he would  shall um actually actually i've had i've had very good luck on consumer products lately um-hum um you know just about i've i've uh gotten recently it's been a new mother board for my computer and that's working fine uh a new motherboard yeah okay because my my other one bit the dust after after a power failure yeah so i i got a you know a very inexpensive motherboard from someone in California very happy we were very fast uh-huh other other than i'm i'm in house conservation buying anything oh yeah how about you i'm not buying much in terms of consumer products these days uh i prefer to travel rather than buy things so yeah i i hear you there the i i guess you know given a choice most people are kind of holding off on uh right getting anything um i'm trying to think back in mind if there's ever been anything anything i got you know the the things i've been most disappointed with is that when you go those time share gimmicks exactly yes and and you get you get like the the quality luggage which is like yes you too can have vinyl you know wallet um right or from the sidewalk vendors that are supposed to be the real thing right you know i i find there's that you just have to be really careful because like especially if you watch TV there's like all such of scams going on where you know like uh you you really have to listen to what they're selling you i mean there's a lot of things like um oh God you you like you know yes you can get whole sacks of beef you know delivered fresh to you if you buy our thousand dollar refrigerator uh-huh or um you know all all these multilevel marketing things all of the well have you noticed even the the newspaper coupons do that they they're tying them in now you know right you can get fifty five cent off if you buy two and something else right and not anything that you want right so i mean if you use the coupon you're just falling for the gimmick and there you are like you know we've i'm getting married this summer and we're going to like wedding expos and things to get fashion and half the thing's like yes we'll give you a free makeover we're Mary Kay cosmetics and uh-huh you know once your name on you our mailing list you know you're damned for life because oh that's right that's right or or you you know or all these little i really think multilevel marketing is undermining the quality quality of American business because people getting so focused on the progress other than the products uh-huh you know it's it's like well you know i could get two hundred distributors on to me each selling one dollar a week and i'll be rich but yeah oh all those pyramid schemes yeah that's what multilevel yeah you know Amway and uh Al Williams insurance which i guess is Primerica now and right and even somewhat is Mary Kay you know she's a local girl Mary Kay you know they they're something yeah oh do oh we we have Dallas to blame for Mary Kay yeah i'm afraid so sorry but yeah i i i find that you know the place where uh i i think the the the one one place were we uh you know consumer price i did fairly well i was leading electronics industry yeah except that i was with a friend yesterday we had his Macintosh um-hum and he had taken it back to the store for repair yeah and the vendors are not living up to the contracts that they get with you for so i mean this is a this is an expensive piece of equipment too expensive in my opinion but yeah well whatever but it's what he wants because he's an animator right and he's using all of those tools and he's having a really difficult time with the hardware and the vendor that he bought it from gave it back to him yesterday charged him forty five dollars and told him that it was a software problem oh no not that oh yeah oh actually actually you know it it's like i have yeah i've i've got a VCR and recently it kind of just capped out on me um-hum and you know i typically when your VCR breaks what you have to do you have to like give it to these guys for weeks right and then eventually they'll get get it back to you but i happen to know this guy who i met met recently he just like took it down to his basement popped off the cover you know took a couple of things off so okay this is just junked up cleaned it out it's working fine didn't charge me anything oh you know i think that the service the really where the American consumer products uh kind of failing is is in the customer service oh exactly and and you know there was no reason that Mike should have had to pay forty five dollars for somebody to run a diagnostic that he had already run and he already knew that it wasn't a software problem right i i mean the best example i guess i guess there's some really it's not um uh the the chain the some really luxurious uh department uh department store in in Texas  one way or the other we're now recording okay um um oh yeah home repair you were helping your parents right i still am really they're um sort of remodeling a house out in downtown Atlanta in Candler Park and uh uh-huh we've done lots to it we've taken out the glass and most the windows and the sashes and replaced them and so you're remodeling okay um-hum how about you well i i just live in a i live in apartment now i uh two summers ago i went to Massachusetts uh-huh and i went with a friend of mine and we undertook a building house uh-huh and this was um a Lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions and it's preconstructed you might say uh-huh and we started in um we started from an empty lot with um trees and stuff on it and we had to cut them uh down and clear the lot we had to call in the escavators and have them dig the basement and pour the basement and um wow went from the ground up our wow one of our main problems was as well in Massachusetts i thought i was gonna well it was a fun time but i thought gosh summer time you know well all it ever did was rain and thunderstorms and um-hum one thing is that we're we had we were gonna pour the basement foundation um-hum and we're in the process and it started pouring down rain um and i guess we had most of it done but the end result what happened was that some of the the water a lot of water settled on the top and it really didn't give a very good finish and some of the it was sort of sandy and and not um a very good finish um-hum but it turned it was okay and it's only the basement floor so it was okay yeah but um it kept us pretty busy it was only um there was well me and my friend and then we just had like two helpers and uh sort of a um-hum a family type it wasn't you know like a commercial project just something that sort of just you know like get your get his you know my brother brother and well maybe you know my cousin's coming over today to help us do that kind of thing and so the uh-huh the scheduling and everything was kind of hectic sometimes and and then materials coming in and so we're we're hopping around pretty good but overall yeah we got it done and it's a it's a three bedroom two bath house and it's pretty neat wow um-hum nice yeah so nice so uh i mean what was it for you just well it was um for my friend's parents they had some property there and they'd lived in this this old it's sort of like a farm you might say and they live in this old house um-hum for something like thirty years or something and his mom just wanted a a new house you know that was been her dream and so we did that and uh she was really pleased with it so we came really great so um-hum that's great wow so what why is it that the weather in Atlanta that gets very hot hm where you live it gets very hot yeah it does and that's why you're and the the windows have you what type of windows are you putting in because the windows are something that is conducive to um temperature changes in um you know the solar game right have you what what are you putting in triple glaze or double glaze or no we just we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it oh okay okay and uh but see in a lot of the windows um um-hum it's the house is eighty years old and it's had several owners and stuff and um they had put plastic Plexiglas kind of stuff in some of the windows okay oh these are so you have the sash windows in did did uh did it go go up and down oh i see um-hum um-hum yeah and so uh and and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there so um-hum yes there's a problem with those those are uh they usually most the time don't open very well yeah ours didn't and the ones that would open uh wouldn't wanna stay open they wanted to slam shut uh-huh um-hum and they also they're they they a lot of vibration and it causes the glass to crack it's a never never ending problem um-hum um-hum yep afraid i haven't uh i haven't been in any really home repair things lately i  Cathy uh-huh do you so what is your uh family what do you usually do as far as budgeting we have a very detailed budget because my husband is a finance major uh-huh and we have you know we have money that we take out each month that we um you know for food and and for for gas and things like that and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for um other things uh-huh then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our needs our needs and wants list um-hum and so um the things that like a vacation we have a vacation fund we have a fund for the things we need and then a for the things that we want uh-huh and um and we're continually putting into those you know each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item uh-huh so we very rarely buy anything on credit everything we buy is paid for yeah my husband is a finance major also and uh we kind of have the same plan um we have one credit card um every month we put um you know the same amount in for retirement um and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting um each month um an allowance for his education starting now right right so that's in our budget every month now that's the newest addition but we too do the same thing as far as um we have a set amount we take oh one big vacation a year and then maybe you know three small vacations so we have you know an exact amount that we spend on that each year right and um we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money um instead of just writing checks for things um-hum um-hum if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here i see and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays that we want to put in for um the vacation that we put in for Christmas like you have a separate account for that then well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house oh i see uh-huh and so it's actually pulled out then we keep our we have a savings account for the kidzees education that money goes into there oh i see um-hum each of our children we have three children so they each have their own account i see that money is put into each month uh-huh does your husband deal in um stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff that does he invest in that and for long-term he does somewhat yeah he does somewhat uh-huh um we have an investment plan yeah i guess he does um-hum but um we have really found this is the first year we've done it this way and we are really saving a lot of money really because you're you've you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to so what goes into that that particular thing it's vacations Christmas Christmas birthdays uh car maintenance dental medical we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much we used on dental and um uh-huh and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover rather than wondering where it's going to come from right we have it uh-huh you know and when when we see something on sale um instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it and then when something comes up you know kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill um-hum everything's taken care of and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought really well you know um what do you do as far as i i take it do you um run the family budget as far as uh groceries and that sort of thing yeah i do uh-huh all the money uh-huh and how what's that all the money is turned over to me uh-huh do you have a set amount that that you spend each month or or how do you work that yes i have a set amount it's very generous and i usually have extra and so then that can go um you know either back into our checking account or i can just carry it over uh-huh um-hum um you know there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months and certain times when that will be left over but that's completely up to me how i do that and then um because i don't work i stay home um-hum uh-huh i do too i stay home also and so it's kind of my money and i also get my own money to do what i want to go to lunches you know and do that kind of thing um-hum we have a clothing um envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing um-hum it really works out great we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that and we're yeah what what as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a TV or um a big item like for the house how do you have like a household yes we have a household budget like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year and also we need a new bed and so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll have enough saved to go buy those um-hum um-hum and if we find one on sale before then then we can just take that and put it towards the  recently graduated from high school meaning like uh you know three or four years ago i'm a senior in in uh college now and uh uh-huh i can't really talk too much about the problems with uh public education in detail because the school system i went to was uh really superb even though it was a public school system really yeah i i feel that my uh i'm a junior in college now and i go to Tech Georgia Tech oh okay yeah and uh i got a friend who goes there by the way i wanted to ask talk to you about that afterward okay okay uh i've the high school i went to was uh was a good one also and i well i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools because the one i went to was you know i'm sure a a lot nicer than you know a lot of the inner city schools and the things around Atlanta yeah yeah it was a a it's a more or less a suburban school system yes that's that was true for mine too um yeah although i i'm sure to some extent that money is part of the problem in the disparity but i don't think i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it what you know i think that uh i mean i know that in my town you know most of the most of the parents they're valued education and uh yeah that's true you know and so the students were you know to some extent motivated to learn i mean you know yeah and i'm also i mean in the in those places where uh like the economy is really bad they might you know be more tempted to to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the you know money to put food on the table and stuff like that more than they would you know in areas where they yeah that's true but but uh i think i mean even more than that even i mean if you drop out in high school yeah uh-huh you should still be able to read you know which it sounds i mean it sounds like uh now i think maybe it just started changing in the past few years because uh yeah that's true they have more of these um sort of mandatory mandatory tests you have to take before you get a diploma but uh right but uh certainly before that there are people that you know like would graduate from high school and could barely read um and that's just sort of inexcusable and you can't really i i i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen yeah you know except maybe to someone whose you know really badly learning uh disabled or something but these people obviously weren't that's hard for me to say since i didn't i didn't really grow well when i went to elementary school it it it wasn't in a great area but i still i mean i learned to read started learning to read when i was in kindergarten you know so i guess i can't really yeah yeah i can't say what it would be like to uh grow up in a really oppressed uh region you know i guess the whole the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the for those people yeah yeah i mean i think that's almost a bigger factor than anything else probably i mean i don't i think you know if people just so i guess the problem is the the thing to do is to try to i don't get some kind of motivation to learn and yeah and again i don't i mean again i don't know that i'm you know how qualified i mean i think it'd be interesting uh-huh to you know to spend a couple of days just looking around an inner city school uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like yeah uh-huh i think that would be an interesting experience but uh i haven't done that no i i can't say that i have either but uh but i do i do think that um i mean public education in general i think can work and i think it's a good thing yeah i've i've i've heard some i mean i've heard statistics statistics statistics and things that that compare a public education to a private education i mean within like within the same uh income groups yeah if you compare the like the people that could have that could have sent their kids to private schools and the people that you know the people that uh did send their kids to private schools i think they compare fairly you know fairly well yeah yeah yeah i mean i don't i honestly don't really think i could have you know done much better than i did in the school system i was in you know i mean it's yeah i i know in my schools also i mean they they have a lot of uh once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh accelerated accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean that that makes a big difference because uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh yeah with people that are really are interested in the in the subject and stuff like that yeah i mean and in the once you book junior high uh start junior high starting in eighth grade all the way through high school there were four levels you well no i guess it was in junior high it was still three then in high school it changed into four levels of uh of instruction in the major subjects uh-huh uh which i mean actually i think that works pretty well i mean that that makes  um let's see so what's wrong with our public school system well i think uh i've been talked into that that one of the main problems is non directive education where you teach kids to basically have a good self image and assume that if they think good about themselves they will they will learn well for example if you deal with uh math scores uh US math scores are um um i don't know seventeenth out of twenty three industrialized nations we're really low i mean i'd be really even surprised if they were that high these are these are scores on standardized tests and yet if you uh give American students the question i am good at math they'll rank themselves much higher than will for example Korean students who do much better at math and um a number of educational theorists uh predominately predominately conservative or they're called conservative because they think this i suppose say that the problem is that we've gotten away too much from teaching the kids the material and too much into let them let letting them discover what they feel or what they want to learn for themselves and that can be seen in you know in math scores it can be seen in sex education where we've had twenty years of generally available sex education in this country at the same time we have a rising crisis of teenage pregnancy uh it can be seen in the fact that students cheat a lot more at least admit to cheating a lot more than they used to they're not told what's right and what's wrong and they're not taught what they needed to be taught the urge they're they're they're taught to discover their own values and their own interest and if you let a kid do that that's the way to get uh you know to get no progress or very little progress are those are are as you talk about that it reminds me of of one problem that i think is probably as far as my perception is the most glaring error um-hum that is because i know a lot of school teachers i know a lot of particularly particularly girls who in like in their their thirties who teach school twenties and thirties and i'm appalled that we have that we pay our teachers so little um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum and we give them so much so such a small budget to work with um-hum and with you know with a virtually nonexistent budget they have to supply decoration you know things bulletin boards on the rooms things for the kids to practice on textbooks yeah yeah yeah and so so so the pathetic the teachers themselves get a pathetic salary and they end up almost across the board taking some of their own money which they don't have and buying school supplies so that they can they can teach their kids and their dedication astounds me that's true yeah um-hum and i right well i don't know i don't know if we're getting a quality education from teachers who are underpaid um-hum but i'm sure i'm sure that it it's like uh i work at AT&T and now i i if i want to spend four hundred dollars um um-hum i don't even have to i don't have to ask anybody i just go do it hum that's probably the teacher's entire budget for the year if they're lucky well i work at NC State University and i do the same thing i spend i spend my own money to buy things that the university you know doesn't provide and i think little things like like transparency pens their transparency pens are pitiful i buy my own um i pay my own way on trips because they don't have any travel budget since nineteen ninety now uh i mean some of it comes from grants but what doesn't come from grants i pay pay for myself and in fact my business deductions are thousands of dollars a year more than the two percent uh limit so so the the the same is true here but you know i i talked talked to one teacher about that at a wedding reception once and i said she said we need more pay i said yeah but but but what you need even more than that is you need more flexibility to do things the way you see that they should be done and she said yeah i agree with that entirely that the bureaucracy really hamstrings teachers um they they they in many places are just told what textbook to teach from whether or not they think it's a good one i mean the decision can be made from a central authority in the state to which is subject to lots of political pressure the teachers don't get to choose themselves what what book to teach uh teach from they go don't get to choose what order to cover things in and they really cannot adapt things to their teaching style in in into their kids uh that is a big problem and i think the large part of that problem is due to the educational bureaucracy here i go you know maligning some some uh uh amorphous much maligned entity but i really think that that's a serious problem that that there's so many layers of administration to make sure that everything's done right that everybody's rights are respected and so forth that there's no flexibility down at the at the at the bottom level and that's what the teachers have to deal with and and by the way that's another reason that their pay is so low because the administrators soak up so much of the budget yeah i think so i for example they will have a a million dollar building um-hum but no no money for supplies yeah yeah well i think that that one way to solve the problem i mean i i you know if anything doesn't work right introduce competition and the the voucher approach approach to um to to to paying for  well here in Logan Utah we got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley hm well here in Seattle uh it's giving the air's getting more and more polluted to where uh we're in kind of a basin and uh Seattle's on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains and uh there's been a lot of lot of growth population growth around here and uh it's uh it's getting worse i think most of it is from cars yeah yeah definitely here in Utah up along the Wasatch front along the western side of the of these Rocky Mountains here where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it's from cars um-hum and uh it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion and when we get get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of LA a few years ago uh-oh it's not it's almost sad because when i grew up here it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys yeah yeah i live in the university district and uh uh it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution i think probably due to uh a lot of students going back and forth to school huh and i'm we're right next to Interstate 5 also they're getting serious about things like uh mandatory well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties emissions oh yeah oh yeah they started doing that yet yeah they've actually started doing it down along the not in Logan up here because we're doing a lot better we have a lot population's a lot lighter up here we have that here and uh they're they're expanding it to uh more counties here um as the population spreads out and i think they're also gonna be making it uh mandatory for more cars there there was uh something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age like over twenty years old you didn't have to get it done anymore and i think they're eliminating that uh yeah yep they're getting eliminating that out here that loophole yeah they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun where they're uh looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the basically how much of what is coming out the exhaust kind of like a radar gun and yes oh really they make you do that remotely yeah do it remotely just looking at the what they do they do several different types of things sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually hm now where does the source light go and like across the street they'll set up like a trap or something that add in some sense and they're also looking at uh oh i see other you know ways of monitoring this and because they found out something basically that uh and a poorly tuned car can emit something it's an incredible amount it was like four hundred times as much jeez um of certain pollutants and it was like unburned hydrocarbons then a a properly tuned car and and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the the pollution then you know you'd it be one way to cut the pollution in half yeah that's neat but it's also been uh oh you know everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but it uh it's tough you know like i've i've looked into riding the bus to work and i can drive to work in uh and get there in twenty to twenty five minutes over a very congested corridor which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges uh-huh but if i uh if i take the bus it requires several transfers and it takes over an hour um yeah and they're so it it's it's not hard to see why i why i keep driving and you know i feel guilty because i'm driving a  do you think should be done for the the uh huge budget we have uh uh well i think the first thing that every every time they talk about it they they say well we can't cut this or we don't need to cut this out of the budget because it's such a small amount in comparison to the overall decifit deficit but i think they need to start doing it i mean the taxes are going to grow so high there's no way we'll ever pay off what we owe now our children is going to pay it yeah i know Graham Krugman that guy Krugman was it uh Grudman he's he's not going for we elected him for that uh again and he said that he didn't think that we'd ever be able to have uh balanced budget i don't think so they had an article in the paper here the other day about uh the interest alone in the year two thousand's going to be more than John Kennedy's entire budget um-hum and when it's it's gone ridiculous now i don't know what's going to happen we'll be like California soon right or what or New York bankrupt yep totally everything yeah the year two thousand that uh we'd be totally dependent on foreign capital and i think so like Japan yeah uh i don't know if that's such a bad thing one so once Japan becomes if we're dependent on them they're most certainly dependent upon us i don't think that the world market would would be as possible for them with out us i mean i don't think Europe is consumer oriented as we are huh they more or less have to sell to us whether where else would you sell that many Toyotas and Hondas and stuff it'd have to be here well you go were the money is and if you don't have the money anymore then that's that yeah um i don't know i think the first thing we could do is uh i'd like to see Congress attached to the decifit or you know or performance right uh attach performance yeah performance calls like you might have at work or or i might have too uh-huh yeah certainly do you do i do too uh it's uh i don't know why they should be uh unregulated and and over the last twenty years we've strictly gone down hill and the salary's gone up well actually their well that's one thing but we also got to change the voting stuff and the uh special interest groups and all that stuff you know we we take a lot of the blame for it we have to start voting we have to start talking we have to start uh doing something about it but we're so apathetic it's almost ridiculous well for one thing uh we've got lives to live i mean for us to uh to stay knowledgeable on all these issues it's a full time job um-hum i mean i go to work every day just like you do i don't i can't sit down and keep up with all of this that's why we elect them oh i understand that but we have to go to vote yeah we have to uh participate in political parties or something uh those kinds of things and we don't even do that no i i don't even think uh participation would have as far as democrats and republicans go it'd have to be a third party oh still i mean we have the right to do it we don't do it that's the whole problem we don't exercise those rights i don't know i think part of the things is maybe a value added tax like what they have in Europe i mean um that would definitely cut down on the consumerism and which really pushes a lot of the uh you know it'd be a good way of getting revenues and all so bring in line towards savings and and putting money into uh instead of spending into investment um you know do you sometimes think it's got to a hopeless position now that there's nothing we could do to reverse it well i don't know i think if people put their minds to it they can do it it's just a matter of mobilizing uh you know the people that do it it's a very difficult task i'm not saying that any of this is easy you know we're we're talking about numbers that i can't even comprehend the numbers were too large for me yeah well think about the wars the nuclear situation and all that talking about the numbers of atomic bombs and how many times you can bomb the world over and how incredible that was and now you you know that's coming to a point where that's less likely less and less likely right economic ruling brought that down  the only experience i have i don't have any children but i've um i was a babysitter in high school and then just recently after we were married i babysat for a dentist while she worked and i just uh-huh yeah that's the only thing i've ever done also is babysit but um i've heard people that i work with talk about you know child care especially i guess it's even harder on single mothers is it oh yeah the expense yeah having to pick up the kid by you know six o'clock or it's five dollars for every minute you're late and stuff like that uh-huh which is understandable i mean these people can't you know stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late but just sit around that's true see the lady i did it for that's why she picked picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up so she could sleep in and um then she could be at home and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever but um she paid i think it was two or three it was about two fifty three dollars a hour and by the time i paid taxes on it it i was getting like eighty cents and that wasn't counting food or oh no gas or anything yeah it's hardly worth your time yeah yeah that's pretty bad the only time i babysat was in high school and it you know of course you don't have i didn't pay taxes on that so right it was easy you know go over to some um it was these people that lived in our neighborhood and i'd just go over there every Thursday night they went to the theater they had permanent tickets and they'd give me it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids but they would usually give me more like five dollars more at the end of the night oh wow and i mean they'd you know it was great i'd go over there and there would be like uh you know there's we have these videos over here watch whatever you want and there's some Oreos in the in the cupboard and there's some Coke and you know just help yourself to anything so it was it was you know the best that was a long time ago and that was only for a few years just once a week wow yeah but i don't know i think people that treat their baby sitters like that get a lot better baby sitters oh yeah that's true and they stick around for longer because i mean after i figured out i was getting eighty cents an hour i said bag it and i quit you know yeah i was just like but i'm wasting my time yeah i really liked the little girl and everything but i thought she does take up and they do take up a lot of your time that yeah yeah i they're very demanding uh-huh well and she was really spoiled they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything so basically they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch and the mom was a dentist and i was just like we've got to quit this and she's like no i don't want her to starve but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat oh shoot my mom would be like like um eat this or eat it or don't eat anything that's right so i can see the concerns on what different people want because some i mean you know if i was setting up a day care there would be so many needs you would have to yeah customize your service to yeah um-hum because some parents won't put up with anything where others would i think yeah i think the best way to go would just be to to be able to do it out of your basement uh-huh and just have like ten at the most like ten kids and all from maybe people that you know type of thing instead of trying actually to set up a day care where you don't know the people coming in and no that's true i i'd love to do it but i just don't trust people now there's too many lawsuits yeah i just i think it's a bigger risk than more than what it's worth yeah yeah it would scare me with i don't know because i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue but i think a lot of them are just you know they're negligent and they get happy about money and yeah they just want to sue you well yeah that's yeah exactly when you have like a Kindercare or something set up and they when they get greedy or whatever that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something um-hum oh yeah and that's just you know you can't watch kids that many little kids getting into things at one time that's impossible you know you never know what they're going to get into i have a girlfriend that works at a day care and she takes her little girl with her and i mean she told me about half the people that they hire and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state and that's the people that are working there you know and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in you know oh that's horrible like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before the same diaper um you know just awful things and so i don't know i don't have kids but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody um yeah that's the the yeah that's a hard thing about it if i mean i mean you just don't know i don't i can't foresee myself getting married but if you know if i ever wanted to have a kid how could i work i mean i don't think i could trust somebody with my kid either unless it was a friend that you know did it in their house that i knew well oh yeah that's true yeah i just i couldn't do it i don't think it would just rip me apart i think i don't know yeah yeah just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait not knowing
