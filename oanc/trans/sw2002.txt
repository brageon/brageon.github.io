 well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly oh this is kind of tough i don't too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis uh-huh i don't have a lot of time and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don't think they have any redeeming value no but uh oh i watch things like uh Sixty Minutes every week uh uh-huh ooh it's kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on Thursday nights at nine o'clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh Knots Landing oh you will yeah just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing but uh relax how about you well i watch um i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program um yeah i don't get that so i don't have that choice yeah i i like that i i watch that a couple of times a week um it comes on like at nine o'clock at night and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i i have seen that um uh-huh Murphy Brown that comes on Monday nights before and it's kind of cute and but i don't uh-huh yeah yeah there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while uh i can't think of the name of the one that has the uh military uh-huh uh fellow i mean he's playing a military part he's the husband of the girl on Designing Women oh the uh-huh right i know who you're talking about i haven't i have seen it i think maybe once yeah you know it was it was on one time when i saw it and you know it it's pretty cute i like that well i um i we really don't watch too many programs regularly my children like some of the morning children's shows when they're home they um i just have one son who's in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like um yeah Eureka's Castle it's called it's just like a Sesame Street show but uh-huh and they watch a couple of shows like that but i don't watch any daytime TV at all yeah no i don't and uh i guess uh there's some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly uh-huh on Saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but uh uh-huh they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that oh oh that's nice and um they have a lot of cooking shows uh-huh and oh you know i'll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i don't sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if i'm uh cooking on a Saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me that sounds like a good idea i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed uh-huh and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else yeah and so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved yeah we do some of that in i'm fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on TV than you know other kinds of things uh-huh well that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies yes that i have really enjoyed that i'm seeing for the first time like the Marx Brothers and things like that yeah yeah those are pretty good i i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff uh-huh right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it's really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable and um-hum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it's so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you you take the notion yeah and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won't miss uh-huh i'm not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal yes well and things are repeated yeah that's true so often that you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it'll be that exact same show if i ever decide to tune it in again yeah yeah the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again pretty funny yep but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on um-hum and we don't want our kids to to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your spare time right i agree so it's a little bit something we try doing and there's there's a lot of good children's programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day uh-huh and you could say oh that's a good program for them because it's educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if they're good programs you don't want them sitting there watching them right yeah anyway well okay well we probably exhausted that huh yeah that was pretty good i i like that and um i guess it's time to go okay i enjoyed talking to you yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-b ye okay good-bye  okay well my favorite probably all time TV show is Star Trek and i would like that i i like the adventure of it uh-huh and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space uh-huh and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it's an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and right finding out about different people and i've i've always liked that show probably the very best uh-huh i think i've actually seen a number of Star Treks one way or another over the years uh although i never watched it regularly i'm certainly acquainted with the character the characters and then i've seen some of the Star Trek movies uh-huh yeah those the movies are good too and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they're all adventures uh-huh when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver because it's it's only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and uh-huh and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider and i don't think i i've even heard of that show it's called McGyver and what is what is he you haven't uh-huh he's like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly uh-huh and uh his his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder uh-huh so he he does all kinds of strange things like that oh great Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a 747 out of it yeah see what we can come up with do you like the uh news shows Twenty Twenty and Sixty Minutes those kind of things well uh i used to watch Sixty Minutes as a matter of fact and uh and i used to like the show very much uh-huh but unfortunately i find getting rid of your TV set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water some of the little things yeah and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didn't get the booze out of the house i was going to drink uh oh so i guess i haven't ever had any trouble with that i have more or less i have my favorite shows and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those yeah but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they're up yeah yeah because they're i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids i like that real well right well when my kids were little i did have a TV set and i did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company as well uh-huh i don't think they have that on anymore oh that would be a shame i haven't seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i don't think they show it must be in maybe it's in if it was in repeats but they're not making new ones huh i haven't seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good yeah how about Mister Rogers is he still around yes yeah they still show Mister Rogers i don't think he's making new ones but they repeat all the old ones i see i see so that's still a real good show too i that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the TV on uh-huh Sesame Street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it's the timing of of it is good besides the amount what's on right i figure your children are preschool yes i have two little ones yeah so they like that yeah i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon they come on both they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six uh-huh okay they just repeat okay over again which is also that's another thing that's good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour i feel can feel like i can let them sit in front of the TV and watch and they're watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot yeah yeah little with little kids the TV set really is a i mean i used it as a pacifier i'm not sure it was that great for my children but they turned out okay so yeah uh it didn't hurt them any yeah some shows are good for i think some shows some Star Trek i for the imagination of it all the idea i i think that's one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i don't let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do uh-huh you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible yeah that kind of thing yeah okay well i think we've covered most of my favorite TV shows well i'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh let's see how about uh Man From Uncle i do seem to remember is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that self-destructed that's Mission Impossible uh Mission that's right Mission Impossible yeah i used to watch that in fact i can still remember a couple of those they were i thought those were very good yeah they always have i've i've seen some of them on repeats yeah that uh they always had a good plot huh it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next right right you how they're going get out of their latest scrape yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i guess i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene oh yeah every Saturday night uh that portraying portraying The Doors appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show huh they even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan and it was very very funny i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie um well i don't know was there any i remember the Milton Berle Show even i was yeah i'm not old enough to recall that one i was well i guess i have to admit that i am my TV viewing started sort of mid sixties so i see my folks didn't my folks i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little that may be why but they probably didn't have a TV until i got to be you know grade school or so yeah and the shows that i like now they wouldn't let me watch i had to catch them all on repeats like Star Trek they thought that was much too violent for small children so huh i i i i ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something yeah that's that's interesting uh i think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV people were just as violent before TV was invented maybe even more so yeah but i guess that's that's a different topic isn't it probably so well i think that's about uh that's about covered it for me so i think i'll say good-bye and we'll yeah well it was nice talking to you tell me tell me where you're calling from talk another time perhaps i'm calling from Garland Texas Garland Texas all right i'm in North i'm in Raleigh North Carolina uh-huh where were you from oh my goodness i didn't know they did it long distance yeah i think they're doing it trying to do it or i hope they're trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different yes different dialects well it was nice talking to you same here bye-bye bye-bye  okay i think we're supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States how do you feel about that okay i don't really i more i don't know about the government as much as um the people uh i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all and i really don't feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore i'm i'm worried about them they're in a very uh tumultuous state right now with the kinds of uh adaptations that they're attempting to go through so i'm concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden they're very large yeah and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around yeah i think that's that's a real important aspect and that uh as the the most the most the most let's see the more that we do that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a you know a reality i know that uh this last winter was very hard on uh several areas in the in the the Ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia uh the people there have money that's not their problem but there's no food for them to buy and its you can't eat money and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um i i'm not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it yeah and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that's not my job right they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now and um they've been they've been under under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they don't know how to act yet they don't understand that to make that work they've got to take some responsibility for themselves it's not just the government's responsibility anymore you can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well absolutely and and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward and i think that that is giving them i'm expecting a call and unfortunately i think it's come through i've enjoyed talking to you thank you bye okay all right bye-bye  you said you have four cats yes i have four cats how old are they about well they range from let's see about a year and a half to nine years old oh gosh yes i haven't had my oldest one quite nine years i've had him probably five years yeah oh okay get so attached to them oh yes i love my cats i lost one one time uh the first one i got he jumped off the balcony actually of a second story apartment and he'd never been outside like you know by himself outside oh oh no uh-huh and it started raining and i was hysterical i was i mean you would have thought a child had died i called everyone i knew i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat and they laughed at me they thought that was so hysterical yeah um-hum yes i understand oh no i understand we have uh we've gone through the same thing with ours we've cut you know they've been ill i mean i take off work to take care of my cats you know the my boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy oh yeah and then we had a baby and its like all right who comes first the cat or the baby right the cat was here first so i know it's hard and and then when we go to sleep at night you know it's like uh my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us it's like all right whose corners is this one oh how funny that's sweet i have the two the other two cats i have are outdoor cats oh uh-huh and they didn't used to be actually but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside so i put them outside once i got a house and they're doing great out there they love it but the other one the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there oh uh-huh other than that he gets scared to death if you shut that door he goes into hiding oh no i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony and lord knows what happened to him yes uh-huh that's it but he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares right traumatized for life here probably oh yeah we've all four of ours are house cats we started out with two with two outdoor cats but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them are they oh no oh well he lived through it oh i couldn't believe it we went through like twenty two hundred dollars worth of vet bills the the cat almost died and but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat oh he loves life now oh my gosh uh i imagine and he's like oh thank you so much i wonder how many of his lives he missed when that happened i know we wondered about that but uh oh that was a traumatic experience for us too oh oh i can imagine what did he shoot him with uh well uh from what we can tell it was a pellet gun and then he started chasing him with a bull whip oh oh my gosh oh yes it was absolutely nuts uh but uh luckily enough you know we found the cat in time and uh rushed him to the vet and it took us about six weeks people are crazy oh Lord of in and out of the vet and surgery and today i mean he started off as a stray and then we did all this for him oh man but oh they he's been a wonderful cat i imagine they usually are after something like that happens to them it just seems to mellow them or something oh yes but uh we wouldn't have we wouldn't have them i mean i don't see us without pets without cats there's just uh there's this they just fill this void no oh yeah i kept i keep talking about getting rid of my outdoor cats because i feel like i don't i can't take care of them as well because they're outside and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back and uh-huh yes i feel like they need a big home a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things but i can't give them up i just i go hysterical when they don't come home oh just oh no right and you worry about oh who's taking care of them you know oh yeah and every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat and you go crazy thinking it might be yours uh-huh uh right well i didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night we we i had one that had we had we had to put to sleep he got so sick and uh well i fell in love with this uh it's a Chinchilla Persian and uh brought him home and uh-huh ooh oh my husband just died it was like we can't take it back you've got we've got to keep it now really well it's here now we have to keep it yeah my my first one that i got i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment and it took me about two weeks to realize that was real lonely so i found this one uh-huh um-hum yes in a actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drive-thru that said free kittens and i thought well that's interesting i'll call them and he was the only one left and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens oh uh-huh uh right oh uh-huh and he was the last one she carried across you know the whole big sad story so of course i had to take him i felt so sorry for him after that and he is uh you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers oh right right oh no yeah he i asked the vet why he did that and he said he was probably weaned too young which he was because his mom was killed so but he is the lovingest cat everybody people who don't even like cats like him yeah oh he never meows he he doesn't have any front claws i had him declawed but he doesn't bite anybody he's just he's just kind of there real friendly and docile oh uh-huh oh that's good oh we just uh just love them they uh you know get to feeling so lovey and dovey and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest and it's like oh your claws need trimming oh yeah yeah we do we call that doing biscuits it looks like their kneading bread oh yes yes oh it just drives us nuts oh i just love cats i like dogs they're okay i had i had a dog when i lived at home but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually um yeah they really are the cats are so independent and they have so much more personality than a dog oh yeah oh yeah they do and but oh they're so much fun to watch them play it's just just hysterical oh they are i love it it's so funny to get more than one cat together because it brings out their personalities and they just act so funny yes oh we've got uh well the two that were outside they're like brothers i mean i've never seen two cats so close and uh they uh will get to playing chase through the house and it is hysterical i mean and then the other two cats w ill follow in suit it's like this train i understand really uh-huh a train of cats running around sounds like a train we've got we have wooden floors and so it just sort of echoes through the house oh how funny i can imagine yeah i wouldn't give anything for my cats i love them to death oh no they're just they're they're just uh they're wonderful uh what are your cats names we have uh Bonzo Bear Poindexter and Felix and what do you have oh how sweet i have Xanadu and Precious and Rascal uh oh Precious and Rascal are brother and sister and they don't look a thing a like nothing Precious is a medium hair yellow cat and Rascal is a black and white short hair huh uh-huh yeah nothing they don't look a thing a like not a thing goodness gracious and they came from the same litter and everything we have uh uh tortoise which is a black and and orange and she's so ugly oh so ugly she's cute right yes uh-huh i mean you can't help but love her and she's the she's the oldest one and but uh very possessive i mean it's like nobody messes with her mama and uh i mean it comes bedtime and she's right there really oh is she the oldest one yeah she's the oldest and she well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also and so yeah it uh yeah really wouldn't have i mean oh if something happens to her um oh i know it's like the end of the world it will be yes i know that's how i am about Xanadu oh goodness you get so attached to them oh definitely my mother has dogs and i'm like no yeah this is nothing like cats yeah you can walk a dog and that's okay for a weekend but cats are good all the time uh-huh right i'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldn't have worked it wouldn't have no that would be a problem oh that's one of the requirements i asked him i said now you do like cats right we don't like have you seen those uh do you ever read Cosmo yes uh-huh there was a cartoon in Cosmo about a year or two ago and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date and there were cats hanging all over him hanging on his clothes you know they had ripped him up and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom he said of course i love cats and you know they were just all over him and sitting on his head the whole nine yards it was so funny oh yeah oh the whole time i was pregnant they kept saying are you getting rid of your cats are you getting rid of your cats you can't be pregnant and have cats i'm like uh no no no right the child will learn to like cats and deal with them i'm sorry we are not getting rid of the cats watch me definitely oh i wouldn't either there'd be no way the whole family was so disappointed oh really oh well right that's life that's how life goes right uh but yes we just just love them to death i know i love mine too uh well well it's been nice talking to you well it was nice talking to you too i enjoyed it me too bye bye okay thanks bye bye  so where have you been where have you been camping before well i've been camping a number of uh of state parks as it were and one of the the first ones that i ever went out with was with another group of people there were some uh college students uh uh out on a camp out and there were probably ten or fifteen little tents strung in a row on a little peninsula sticking out into Lake Texoma oh yeah and the wind started blowing and it was one of my earlier trips to be really out in the middle of no where as far as wind breaks go and and we had secured tents real well even if we had done it in the dark at eleven o'clock at night and uh oh i guess an hour into my somewhat sleep a guy woke me up and uh said you'd better get out of the the tent they're they're liable to come down several of the others had already come down blown down they hadn't blown away but they had flattened and i said okay i didn't you know was kind of groggy didn't know what was going on and crawled out of that tent and uh sure enough uh shortly after that they blew down so we're out here in the pitch dark in this wind and it starts to rain naturally and we managed to uh fortunately the rain didn't last long but we managed to get them all back up and uh got some sleep in that night and after we got uh back from the weekend we checked with one of the parents of one of the other college kids and they were a little concerned they had heard on the radio that the winds on the dam there anyway had gotten up to ninety seven miles an hour straight winds and good grief and we could believe that we were out in that at that time and it uh it can be quite a horror story i guess and i yeah that was a bad a bad place to be especially right there on the water at night especially if it i mean if it were summer you're all right because it probably wasn't too cold but uh probably the worst one that ever happened to me was in when i lived in South Dakota yeah yeah right it was summer um i was stationed at Ellsworth there at Rapid City and it's right there at the Black Hills and i just absolutely love the Black Hills it's the greatest place in the world to go camping you throw a pack on your back and get up in the mountains and you can understand how the Indians got real religious up there because it's just it's just awesome up there so quiet and peaceful and the wind blowing through the trees and all that i had a favorite little camping spot i used to go to it was uh right next to a stream and all the streams of of course are mountain fed melted snow so it's nice and ice cold a good place to keep your eggs and stuff and this little place was uh it was a perfect a perfect circle of trees right yeah it was almost like they were intentionally planted that way and i would camp right in the middle of this thing and it provided shelter and everything else it was just absolutely terrific well the winters are pretty tough up there and right around March i start get cabin fever and i say oh man i got to go camping so throw all the stuff in the car and of course being the careful camper that i am i carried my uh propane heater with me and a couple bottles of propane and so i get my tent up and i get my fire place built and all that and i'm just having a good time and uh that night it got down to seventeen degrees below zero and snowed um and i'm sitting in this tent in my sleeping bag freezing so i said oh time to get this heater cranked up so i cranked up the heater and this things going of course i got it going full bore i run out of propane so here it is about three o'clock in the morning and i've got to hike back to my car to get more propane well across the stream there's a fallen log that you have to walk across to get into this little place and i'm crossing over the top of this thing it's snowing the thing is slippery and of course i slipped and fell in so at three o'clock in the morning i'm up to my neck in freezing ice cold water and i can just feel my heart just you know scrunch right up the size of a pecan so i finally drug myself out of that i just got in the car and drove home i left everything sitting there i just got just got in the car went home got uh got a nice hot shower uh i got some dry clothes on and then went back huh that was probably the worst thing that ever happened yeah i i i hope to never venture into something that drastic it's fun though that that was i just absolutely loved it up there that whole part of the country was great went to uh Glacier National Park a couple of times and oh Yellowstone Yellowstone is just too crowded though it's not a lot of fun with a whole bunch of people around and these stupid bears i mean they're almost tame they come up begging for hand outs you know course i'm uh-huh yeah yeah a couple of generations of you know being around people and boy there's nothing left of them as far as wildness goes well that's true and and it's sad because now they they're so used to people they're going into the towns and raiding garbage cans and stuff and that presents a threat to the people living there and now they're having to shoot them huh you know i mean it's sad because those those bears were doing fine until we got there you know and now they're now we're killing them because of something that some monster that we created that's true right so i don't know it upsets me a little bit i like bears they're pretty they're pretty cool yeah that's it's a shame to change a whole area so much like that yeah and to me Yellowstone was just too uh commercialized i mean it it's it's got some areas that are really nice but i mean you get up there and everything is just you know you know souvenirs and all this kind of junk huh and i i sort of i like the really raw land you know go out and where no man has gone before and that sort of thing yeah i uh uh i've been mainly with groups of people and uh sometimes with a family here and there a couple of families get together but mainly it college age kids and uh on this one weekend where the tents blew down that same weekend we had one one college kid that yeah he thought he wanted to come and then when he got there it was a little more boring and you know that place doesn't have a whole lot to do up there and uh he sat in his car most of the time and and uh listened to his tapes and fortunately he didn't keep them crank them up too loud but he uh he stayed in the car and did what he could have done at home as it were and it was no surprise when Sunday rolls around and the car won't start and then you listened to tapes all weekend you know yeah that's right there goes his battery it doesn't take much but uh we got him all back going and packed up and came on back uh let's see i i had another another camp out that wasn't uh near as bad in fact it had some really good good points to it i'm trying to think of exactly where we were uh we were on another lake i don't remember the the name of it but we were right up at the shore and the way it was layed out the camp grounds were uh it was another state park and the campgrounds had railroad ties blocking off a sandy pit and that made for a fairly level place to put the tent but to get down to the beach you had to walk down a real steep embankment i mean it was so steep they had put railroad ties as stair steps every once in a while mainly for the erosion and that became a path as it were uh-huh yeah but the beach was beautiful we managed to comb out some of the broken glass and the like but the actual sand was a real good quality and real deep and we set up the old volleyball net and you know just a typical uh twenty or thirty guys playing volleyball on the beach and this this cove this beach was a bit of a cove and it was surrounded oh i'd say a couple of hundred yards by uh this hill this mountainous uh rock terrain and only that little bitty section of it was actually beach the rest of it was water right up against the rock so you pretty well had the whole area to yourself there were enough of us where we filled the whole peninsula as far as the the camping on both sides so we did we all had to walk down to the one area to go down to the bea ch and it was pretty much the whole area to ourself beautiful weekend however at that time at that stage in our life our kids were were uh real young and one of them managed to catch diarrhea while we were there so we'd have to run him up the the hill and you know the little portable toilet was up there and uh-huh and uh it was a little bit to bulky to bring all the way down to the to the beach with us and we probably should have found some way to do that or but uh and it was hot and we had a little trouble keeping ice it didn't last as long as we had planned so we had to buy that a little more often but uh the beach just couldn't uh couldn't have been any better a good place to dive for balls uh-huh uh-huh yeah i uh i used to uh when i was over in Guam i used to go out and just spend the night on the beach and go scuba go scuba diving at night and looking around it was a lot of fun yeah you have to get pretty far out of the Dallas area to uh be able to see the stars and uh we do that on the camp outs yeah all the all the all the light pollution yeah yeah that was one good thing about the hills you could get up there and it was just it was crystal clear it was just beautiful you saw stars you never saw before great place i'd love to go back up there yeah huh maybe i'll get back up there one of these days yeah of course i'm in i'm in North Carolina now and and uh the mountains here are pretty nice i haven't been i just got here last September but i'm planning to that's true do a little camping trip this summer get up there in the mountains and have a look we used to uh when i was in Alabama as a boy uh we used to have our YMCA retreats in uh  okay Mary yes um the uh the latest one i've seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um and it was uh it was called Manhunter actually uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental dysfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people uh just uh kill them with uh with as much blood and and guts as possible oh how awful it was true it was truly awful it was not one that i picked but uh uh it it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the FBI because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were FBI people and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the FBI about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that and it was uh uh it was was pretty telling about the the the FBI and and their procedures i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional yeah i i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh going i guess yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes yeah yeah uh the most recent movie i saw uh i'm afraid was uh well two two of them actually uh the Rain Man was one oh that was a great one wasn't that fabulous and and Driving Miss Daisy oh i loved it you know i haven't seen that one yet and i need to go see it oh you need to see that that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people yeah uh-huh two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was Black and this all took place in the South and uh normally never the twain shall meet oh my um you bet especially in the South yes right and um uh it it it really was a fantastic movie the acting was phenomenal but as it it as i recall it got some Academy Awards didn't it oh yes Jessica Tandy won best actress and uh say oh yeah that's right it it might have one best picture too yes it did yes it did just as Rain Man uh with Dustin Hoffman yeah um-hum that was uh that that was tremendous and Tom Cruise yeah i i think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from Dustin Hoffman but uh yes uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman yeah it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff and yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right there in Cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of Dayton oh is is the Kmart there that was oh well we do have a Kmart here you better believe it isn't there a Kmart everywhere that was so funny had to or was it Kmart uh he had to buy his underwear at Kmart yes right right yeah that was hilarious the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks yeah oh yes and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable yes yes well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things and everyone feels they are totally retarded yeah yeah yeah well because that's the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there's a lots going on in there that's right it's amazing yeah yeah and i the the i think the the best thing about Rain Man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease yes and only and and and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then again then again work with it toward a good end yes and the not not toward you know winning in Las Vegas for example right well the warmth that developed between them and again it i think was a picture of relationships yeah again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident yeah right right i was uh i was so impressed with that movie i saw it three times i can i can say tell you oh oh so much about that movie just because it it did you it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background i i have a a brother myself that's that's older and uh he's not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes yes and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers that was neat uh-huh well that's tremendous that it's good because it does make you think about your own family yeah a lot and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother um-hum no question he the he was he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that he likes the bang them up shoot them up things um-hum uh and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it but uh oh boy he was uh uh he he gave the the the best response that i've heard him give of this type of movie for Rain Man i mean he he certainly didn't he only saw it one time and he didn't go back for more but uh but he he said he enjoyed it and and well he at least saw it one time yeah yeah yeah and and he really i don't know he he he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this i'm like oh come on well just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had yeah it and to make it believable i mean i was i i was believing it i don't know about anybody else but i was it was great yes well i'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them he did great well it's just uh been delightful talking with you yeah yeah you take care up there and uh let's hear it for the summertime absolutely i'm ready for it they're predicting some more snow for our direction no oh no oh well take care take care now bye bye bye bye  okay well go ahead i'll let you start uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people uh be required to do service public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family uh-huh or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you can't make it everybody right yeah but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way too um-hum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they take you you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there's nothing physically wrong with you then you're drafted it doesn't matter how rich you are and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right that would be good what'd you say give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass oh yeah uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money uh uh-huh and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they could could subsist that's true um-hum well that's true the America's paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time yeah because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that's that's really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so you're really learning a skill yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what could we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country i'm just teasing what'd you say um-hum yeah i i think well that's probably the idea i don't know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country well i thought it'd be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too a trade off yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uh-huh yeah and other than that i can't think of any other ideas yeah that'd be sort of neat yeah well i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare course that's what um that's sort of like what Truman had or or was it Roosevelt i can't remember um with the big oh with WPA yeah yeah uh-huh getting people or the work the work program and all the all the make work jobs that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building and we're still using those things too what'd you say we're still using those things yeah that's true a lot of them still out there like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why they built lodges before too like at Caddo Lake lake what Caddo Lake Caddo Lake it's between Texas and Louisiana no never heard of it it crosses into both of them well it's real pretty it's like a swamp you know with all the Spanish moss on the trees it's really it's eerie yeah oh oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah yeah oh okay yeah i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a Texan but i guess that's uh that's what we're going to have this is uh a TI experiment to see how talk Texans talk to other people i don't know where are you from uh Virginia Virginia oh that's neat i talked to somebody from Ohio the other night oh yeah it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to um social services uh i'm i'm i'm glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services because um-hum like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn't even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it'd be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service there is somebody and i read uh i can't remember who it is but there's a really famous of dang i can't remember his name yeah that proposed it i read something in People about it huh Mitch Snider i don't know who Mitch Snider is politician is pushing it or uh or Mitch Snider or Mitch Snider oh okay well see that's a DC thing Mitch Snider is the the advocate for the homeless that uh he he said said said it out here in Washington uh Washington but he started the um uh the movement for creative nonviolence yeah yeah he started that and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless but uh so what have your other topics been excuse uh the other topic was like i said uh something about politicians i can't remember exactly what it was it was a real general statement i had one that i hated it was what meal would you cook for uh a special dinner i mean how far can you go with that one right and another one though that was good was uh gee whiz yeah what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems that have been it's probably the best one uh-huh that would be neat i'd have to basically say my birth yeah and we had to talk about air pollution too what do you think's causing it and what should we do about it um-hum well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know yeah uh-huh right cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the south would say don't burn coal you know it's because we don't have much coal oh we have a lot of coal but uh it's uh it's a dirty fuel that's for sure in Virginia yeah well how'd you get into this program excuse me how'd you get into this program how did i get into it oh i'm uh electrical enginee r uh here in Virginia for TI no no uh no they i'm in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know so does your company have something to do with TI uh not really i mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else but uh no no real association with TI other than being in the same industry hum um-hum electronics industry they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they does do business with saying that you know if you're interested we're doing a study and and since and do you know how much how long this is supposed to go on i don't know no i don't that's i don't either i mean it says just keep on until and they'll notify you at first i was thinking it was just a week because that's all it shows you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week um-hum right so what do you think we're going to get what what do you think what what do you think we're going to get for this get yeah money prizes oh i don't know do you know anybody that's ever done this get your own yeah get your own T I seven four L S thirty two or something what was it i know TI gets prizes a little chip oh yeah i didn't hear about that probably for TI employees yeah and i was led to believe that if you weren't TI that you get money i'm not TI oh oh you're not you don't work for Texas Instruments oh okay huh-uh let's see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing oh oh and i just signed up for it oh that's a neat idea uh-huh yeah yeah well he's gotten a good mix i i was saying because i've like i said i heard some other people talking they've talked to different people in different states and stuff uh-huh that's good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so so probably knock TI's profits margin way down and it shouldn't be too good right now anyway because they've been laying off so many people yeah right this is probably some government study program yeah really so we're footing the bill on our taxes okay okay well i enjoyed talking with you okay well thanks a bunch we'll talk to you later bye i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes she's diving into well i'm going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around okay bye okay we'll i'll talk to you bye-bye  our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive where do you live i live in San Antonio San Antonio um-hum well um i live in Garland and we're just beginning to we we just built a real big recycling center um-hum that recycles everything imaginable but as far as that um trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing um-hum they're testing that so they're really not full full force into it but they're trying so we're attempting it but i wish we could do more yeah there's there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in San Antonio i used to work for the power company here and there was discussion for a while about uh building a garbage burning um-hum uh electric generation plant but it just wasn't cost effective at the time oh and there's there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city but there isn't any um advertising campaign there's just not any push to recycle i recycle my newspapers and uh aluminum my aluminum stuff huh right that's what i do but uh they make it as hard as possible it's not very convenient to do right where they put centers and stuff like that um-hum yeah well we have those um which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans i don't know if you all have those around yes and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center and you can just stop by now everything else like the trash um paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers but um-hum but for aluminum that's real nice and i started doing that at work um i put out a a trash can and and for people to put their aluminum cans in um-hum and that's really helped a lot i mean everybody's pitched in and yeah you know it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can yeah so i really i really like that but people are really concerned it's just that sometimes it's not the right people yeah which is really really sad because i wish we would do more at work we started um all the recycling stuff they're really trying i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year yes and um that really started a lot of stuff off but you know sometimes it dwindles down yeah where i work now we recycle all the computer paper that's good but that's about the extent of it well that's well at least your trying something yeah yeah it's just yeah it would be nice if it could be more and i'm sure that the uh driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so we sell the paper back to oh do you really the uh to a paper manufacturing company well that's a neat idea well it it defrays the cost of buying the paper i think i not by much but it does defray it some uh-huh right enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building sure well that's that's really good i mean at least they're trying yeah yeah i know a lot of companies that waste so much that i'm even trying you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building and you know the nice cardboard boxes that you move packing boxes yes and they were just used one time and thrown in the dumpster and i thought i don't understand this you know we're trying to cut cost and everything like that and and recycle and all that stuff and yeah and here we are wasting and i don't understand sometimes the way the thinking the logic behind it well the last time uh someone moved offices in my building and uh the uh properties people came in with all with the good cardboard boxes not the cheap ones of course and packed everything up and moved them and left them lying around uh-huh i i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon and they're good boxes and they were just going to throw them away that's exactly what i did that's exactly what i did exactly because i didn't want to waste that and it's hard enough to find good packing boxes though yeah hum-um right and and these boxes are you can unfold them right so you know there they don't take up much storage space that's exactly right well that's very good yeah yeah i i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away so uh right right i found about and i thought well i was doing them a favor by taking them i found about five um about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes yeah that were in the dumpsters and i was like oh gosh so many people need so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes um-hum when you know these are perfect so yeah the ones at the grocery store half the time they've pulled the lid off so you can't use it anyway right right right those and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in with the nice lids those get thrown away uh-huh right and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes that's exactly what i do those are those are perfect boxes to put files in uh-huh they're good for storage and stuff like that that's what i do with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store her you know like her out dated cards or out of out of season clothes in them and they're just perfect what what i've done in the past i don't have any now but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids uh-huh and you can stack them up and and leave them out and put things in them even and they look just as good that's a smart idea um-hum yeah i think i have to that that's really cute yeah well you know it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at Target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever and now they they're the exact same thing um-hum that's all they are they just made them look fancy yep save you some money and you're recycling yes well that's neat well do you all have um we have places that um pay for paper to recycle i know you do yours at work but for newspaper um-hum but ours are real hard to find that's the one thing that really discourages me i saved paper you know i recycle paper but they it's almost like they don't want the paper because they don't pay at all i mean they're real hard to find the places that pay and that's really discouraging i mean i just go ahead and take it to the the regular place where it's you know they just accept it uh-huh but they um i think they should you know they want people to recycle i think it's a you know like the aluminum you know it gets people to uh doing it you know you might you don't have to pay them a lot yeah i live near a WalMart and there's a big uh uh huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front in fact i think there's two of them that have several openings um-hum and it's for recycling and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category i don't maybe there's two for aluminum uh uh-huh and you don't get paid but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there well that's that's good yeah that's good i the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is um like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash but in uh um-hum in the paper one you have to separate you have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper like magazines um-hum you can't throw any of that away and you can't throw certain file type things away and i just think it's such a hassle it seems like it would be be easy to take it all i don't know of course i don't know all that about um-hum recycling so probably it is a hassle but i do get tired of having to separate paper you know we um-hum it gets to be uh i guess you have to make it a habit i mean you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit right right we had uh a write up in our paper uh this last time at work about um they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash and every other day they do your recycling trash um-hum and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had um dumped all the trash in the same bin oh and when they were questioned about it they said well we're running late or we didn't have time to do those bins or something and that's real discouraging thinking you're sitting there working to separate it and then they and someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags right right so they're they're really trying to start keeping an eye out for those you know talking to the people again about you know separate them because that is discouraging when you when you do that it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans um-hum but luckily that'll all get straightened out and and they'll they'll start separating them because i don't mind doing that i feel like i'm doing uh doing something for the community when i'm doing that yeah but anyway well i've enjoyed talking to you you too well thank you bye bye bye  uh the last movie that i saw i i don't go to that many so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was Awakenings with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro okay yes uh-huh have you seen it no unfortunately i haven't i heard it's really good but it is i just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro he is one of the best actors i've ever seen it's uh-huh there's a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less uh-huh but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can't you know control his movements at all um-hum and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor uh-huh though what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is no it was very serious very serious oh how does he do serious stuff he's good he's he's talented boy he is yes yes i've only seen him in funny stuff and so i know me too but uh well what was that show um Garfield uh Garfield i want to say Garfield but that wasn't yeah uh Garp The World of Garp yeah The World According to Garp he wasn't always funny in that show was he i didn't read see the the movie i read the book but i i did too and that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part but yeah yeah yeah in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so yeah right yeah well what have you seen i think the last movie that we went out to see was Dances With Wolves oh i saw it uh well good we've both seen one did you cry through much of yes the whole way i was telling a friend i i said i only cried twice but each was about half an hour long so where did you cry um let's see when i each time that i thought that the Indians were going to get killed i cried um i cried the first time when the um um-hum the wagon man got killed when they attacked him uh-huh yeah yeah and um i think from there on through the movie let's see what else did it um what other parts i can't remember any of the other parts right yeah i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed well i don't remember when the horse got killed oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him oh yeah yeah and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know and that horse has been such a pal to him um-hum yeah when he was alone you can tell i'm an animal lover you can hear my dog uh unfortunately we don't have any animals so um yeah but it was a beautiful story it really was it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes um-hum um oh i thought it was awful that was and so graphic i mean i hadn't even imagined it you know i think we've all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo yeah um-hum um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie of course they raise them now you know to eat oh oh uh-huh yeah that's not but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that um-hum yeah well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in no it wasn't um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful like that was great and there were so many of them i didn't know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place oh yeah yeah really so that was pretty really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path um-hum yeah and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing i wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast i guess they graze though that wouldn't have been a problem i know yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie no huh-uh it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real um-hum i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh-huh that's the part they had trouble finding was wolves oh i guess they're just not domesticated or or yeah right they just don't howl that much anymore huh i could they could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that's all they'd have to do that'll teach them with a couple minutes huh yeah well that's funny well i think we've made it yeah oh is that five minutes is that i don't know is it five or three okay oh i'm not sure i'm not either okay well i think we're we're we've done okay though well thank you for calling okay me too well thank you hope you enjoy some more good movies lately yeah you too bye bye bye bye  well uh she said uh one was a total ban on gun control and ten was uh no control at all where do you fit in there yeah well i think you'd probably have to put me at the at the ten area ten or nine oh is that right well we're probably not too far apart i'd probably fall in there at a seven or eight yeah i uh i just you know it's it's you know weapons weapons obviously do not kill it's the people that operate them and well i pretty much agree with that that's uh with with two hundred years of uncontrolled gun control in this country i mean it was founded on that it was one of the things that founded this country i can't imagine trying to to do that and if you pass laws you're gonna make a lot of um-hum criminals criminals because people wouldn't register them i i i live in California and and we just had a a registration a law registration for automatic guns and uh uh-huh they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this state and less than about i think fifteen hundred people registered them is that right in the whole state yeah yeah in the whole state golly well the so what is happened now is that those people that did not register them are um they're now criminals themselves yeah that's that's the crazy thing about it you're you're putting they're now criminals they're they're putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on the honest citizen the one who doesn't give them a problem anyway you know and it's it's crazy they're just putting more giving more paper work problems to the honest citizen and and you know because uh a person whose gonna use a gun for a crime he's he's not too concerned with the crime of not registering his gun no no no that's absolutely you know it's like it's i i i i don't really quite understand the idea that people think that i mean i i'm all for registration in the sense that uh a a a lawful person can go down and get a gun and and maybe you shouldn't be given one the day that you go down they should be able to do a check i think possibly and yeah i i would agree with that that you know well you know that's that's why i say i kind of fall into a seven or eight range there you know i i don't have a problem with registration yeah yeah but uh you know when it comes to restrictions and and yeah and and just plain can't have guns yeah yeah it it is crazy because like you say this country was founded uh and obviously had a uh had a big interest in in letting them their citizens arm themselves and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws don't have but it's one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think oh absolutely not only that but i think there's also a hidden a hidden wealth in in in the citizen having firearms and that hidden wealth is is that i would really i would really feel sorry for anybody for a country that that tried to physically invade this country yeah yeah mean because you know it's it's a country where everybody has a gun and they're gonna have some trouble i mean you know in the mom and pop little towns and stuff they're gonna run into people with guns uh-huh yeah oh yeah yeah they're and and that that is sort of a hidden security factor i think for this nation you know i mean oh yeah everybody who lives out in the country or or around around my area everybody who lives out in the country has a gun sure at least one yeah you know and it's not for uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun it's no big deal it's that's the way they just brought up well uh where're you from by the way but but yeah i am in uh Trenton Texas did you yeah did you say you were in California Texas yeah i'm in California right now i'm i'm originally from North Carolina though i well i well i didn't know this program reached out that far hey it's reaching all over all right well that's that's a neat deal well listen you think they've earned their money we've earned our money tonight oh i bet we have we gave them a few minutes worth all right well listen you take care of yourself all right all right you too good night then bye bye good night all right  well Jerry do you have a favorite team oh yeah uh the of course the Dallas Cowboys yeah Cowboys yeah i live live and die with them okay well they're rebuilding right now yet i think it's going to take them a couple more years before they can be a really good team yeah yeah yeah uh of course i guess really the reason i like the Cowboys is because SMU was my favorite team uh college pardon me college team and of course they started out with Don Meredith right and uh so that that tie there between SMU and the Cowboys i think the Cowboys have shown a lot of improvement this uh past year yeah uh Jerry Johnson surprised me okay i didn't think he was going to do very good because i thought he was a college football coach and not a professional coach yeah okay yeah i think a lot of people had that impression that uh that he ought he should have stayed in the college ranks but uh looks like they're going to do all right yeah yeah course he he came after a legend too Tom Landry so he had some uh tough row to hoe there my yeah big shoes to follow well my favorite team is a is a sentimental favorite uh the Green Bay Packers i grew up in that area and have been following them yeah yeah pardon my for coughing i've been coming down with a cold been following the Packers ever since uh they won the first two Super Bowls yeah they used to have some uh bang up fights and dig in the trenches with the Cowboys the Ice Bowl and yeah they sure did i remember those the other uh games that they would play for the Super Bowls yeah i actually know some people that went to the Ice Bowl yeah at uh they had they had some good teams though they could have had a good year this year uh unfortunately the quarterback uh controversy they had where Don McCowskey got hurt and couldn't play most the season yeah yeah they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract yeah so i don't know if he's going to be in shape to and course they were they were kind of like the Cowboys in that after Lombardi who could fill his shoes uh-huh but uh who did you root for in the Super Bowl i i didn't really have a favorite in the Super Bowl i just wanted to see a good game yeah both New York teams i i was tired of blow outs uh-huh well that turned out to be a good game and it it was it was good to see a good good uh championship game i think Buffalo is an up an coming team they're going to they're showing some real promise for the next uh few years yeah the Giants are always uh always there perennially a good team yeah well their coach has a lot to do with that i think i think they had a lot of luck there too with Montana getting hurt in San Francisco yeah yeah i think if if he was uh healthy San Francisco would have stomped those guys it wouldn't have been much of a contest yeah yeah but uh there's a lot of parity now compared to what it used to be yeah i think it's getting better more competitive yeah uh we see uh teams getting in the play-offs every now and then with uh five hundred records or a little below even yeah the uh AFC Central is a lot like that with uh Pittsburgh Cincinnati Cleveland and Houston nobody really dominated that division last year at all yeah yeah another one of my favorites was in the old uh AFL or the uh uh American Football League the Dallas Texans when they started right in fact they were they out drew the Cowboys there for quite a while okay i wasn't living here then so i can't talk much about that yeah but uh but some of these some of the uh i get a little disappointed sometime with with uh players now days compared with the old players it seems like most the players today are right are playing for the money rather than the the uh fun and for the uh competition that used to be in the older days well there's no doubt about that the money's there and the owners are willing to pay if unfortunately uh and you get star players like uh like Joe Montana making four million dollars a year and everybody else wants to match that type of salary now uh yeah right and of course the people end up paying for it are the fans yeah uh it's no wonder ticket prices are so high yeah i don't go to games myself uh uh yeah i can't afford to go to them no you you really can't not when it costs twenty six dollars a ticket and uh so much for parking nah you you take yeah you take just two just a man and wife by the time you pay the tickets the parking uh any kind of refreshments or anything there you can spend a hundred dollars right quick sure and not many people can afford to spend a hundred dollars on the weekend yeah i think the owners have somewhat lost sight on that because uh they are all wealthy people and uh the expect that uh the average Joe is going to be able to to go to a game and uh pay for that type of entertainment yeah yeah and also i don't like the deal uh with the uh Cowboys stadium where that you to get a decent seat you have to buy a season ticket sure the only seats they have available are in the end zone yeah it looks like Jerry Jones is trying to make as much money as he can out of this deal uh he's got his own TV show and he opened the Cowboy Corral out in in the parking lot there yeah yeah and uh every every opportunity there is to make a dollar he seems to be exploiting that yeah but that's that's true just about every i think there's still a lot of distrust for uh for an Arkansas man to come here and own uh uh Texas team a team in Texas yeah and uh i don't think that's going to die very quickly he is getting some support there were a lot of people that are uh that were skeptical and the Cowboys are coming back and they have a pretty good team Troy Aikman looks like to be looks like he's got the star qualities for a quarterback hum yeah yeah yeah if they'll just give him some protection and don't kill him before h e yeah well i was surprised at the the way they drafted last year they didn't really didn't go for the uh big offensive lineman or the defensive lineman they're going for the skilled positions so quarterbacks they really yeah really didn't need that type of uh player yeah and i you know i think defense really is what wins wins uh in the long run you can have the best half back there is or the best quarterback but if they don't have any blocking maybe they can't do anything yeah they've got an awful lot of good draft picks coming up it's going to be interesting to see what they do with them yeah so hopefully we'll see some more improvement yeah and uh the other teams in the NFC East uh they're they're getting uh older uh they're going to have to like the Washington Redskins uh that that's an older team and they're going to have to start rebuilding pretty soon too yeah yeah looks like we'll reach a point of uh parity there where the Cowboys may start being a little more competitive with the rest of those teams yeah what i don't know what Philadelphia's going to do without Buddy Ryan it might be interesting to see uh i don't know i i have mixed emotions about him uh sometimes i like him but at the same times i love to see somebody beat him yeah he's uh one of those guys you love to hate because he's got a mouth on him kind of like uh Jerry Glanville yeah man you love to hate yeah they they do pick up the image of a team though uh and they create a lot of excitement locally so i think they're good for the game just because they are diverse and they bring a different attitude yeah yeah but um but he yeah to me he's just like the Yankees you just but uh they're not my favorite people either you love to see someone beat him uh-huh but um they do have a good team well Buddy will probably get another job yeah and i think old uh i think Cunningham is an excellent quarterback oh he's great i saw him play when he as at uh UNLV he was not only the quarterback but the punter and he can punt the ball sixty yards no problem yeah yeah yeah i imaging he could play just about any position on the team except maybe a defensive lineman but he's a very excellent athlete he's a very good athlete that is true uh-huh yeah Philadelphia expected to do a little better this past year unfortunately they uh they got cut a little short yeah well i don't they uh the games they lost lost i don't think they lost by any blowout i think they were all close games no i like the team i really really like the Eagles a lot but uh Buddy Ryan is not one of my favorite people so i wasn't too disappointed to see them lose no i i'm wondering where he's going to wind up i don't think he's going to get a head coaching job this next year um he'd be lucky if he can get an assistant uh job someplace yeah um he's just one of those guys he's created such a controversy in Philadelphia nobody wants to touch him right now yeah but uh he'll he'll wind somewhere i'm sure he will he's not going to have problems there if not in the NFL then in one of the other leagues yeah i'm kind of interested how this new uh league's going to summer league's going to fare the World Wide Area Football League WWAFL or whatever they call it WWAFL World Football League yeah yeah yeah i think that the NFL is going to use that league as uh uh kind of like as a minor league to recruit players yeah the way people talk about uh there's not that it won't be as good as the NFL because uh there's not that many good or quality football players i can't believe that not only that but they don't pay the money either yeah but uh uh it's very low uh scale compared to the NFL but uh i still think there's plenty of good football players around that just were not able to get on the NFL because the NFL's teams were just full right well some people i'm sure the the more talented people in that league are going to try to uh impress NFL scouts with their play in that league yeah but yeah and wind up in the NFL possibly but that's that's uh one in a million shot if they have the talent to be in the NFL they're going to get drafted and make a pro team there aren't going to be too many people that that'll make uh the NFL out of uh WWALF yeah yeah yeah it will be like Italian basketball with the uh with with the uh NBA yeah some guys can come back and play in the NBA but most of them don't really don't have the physical skills or the talent right but uh i'm i'm looking forward to the season i think it's going to be fun yeah i think it will be a good year the Cowboys are showing constant  okay well let's see uh probably uh in the last few weeks the biggest uh way i've had of keeping up with what was going on in the Gulf was CNN and i think maybe that's probably true for everyone right uh we don't uh get that in uh straight fashion but you know the other major channels have been carrying a lot of it so i've seen a good bit of their coverage oh well we get we get the first you know it comes directly to us from CNN and it's a continuous coverage and course they repeat themselves a lot and it was really easy when uh-huh as we said well nothing's happening in the war because now they're interviewing the what seems to be dozens of Mideast experts all at once right oh they've really done uh good job of keeping everybody informed of what's going on sometimes i've wondered if it wasn't almost more than we needed to know hm a little much yes we have uh we're a town of five thousand and so our local newspaper is not too swift uh-huh well our um newspaper does a pretty good job on most things but you know its uh not totally in depth and quite frankly i didn't read all of the war stuff um-hum you know it was just there were too many long article and i try to quickly read through the paper before work in the morning so i don't don't get to spend a lot of time on everything so you are off to work this morning i'm at work yes oh you're at work oh i assumed that these were home telephone numbers uh-huh uh we also get a Chicago uh paper and course that's where our main coverage as far as world events are concerned our local paper is just current events what about your uh radio stations do they uh provide much in the way of current event stuff in our town of five thousand we have one that is uh local FM AM station and their news is fed from CNN too uh it's more of uh oh call in for a trading post type thing and uh the fifty music from the fifties and uh it's i guess what you'd expect from a farming community uh-huh well i've lived in a small town before and was quite aware of the local radio station at that time and i know how they are um-hum well ours uh that we tend to listen to most um i like the way they handle news type things because in the morning and in the evening they'll have you know five minutes worth of news every half hour hm but in the middle of the day they don't just drown you with the same old stuff and they won't interrupt unless it's you know really important um-hum and and of course they did a good bit for some of the war stuff but they didn't just over do it i only watch one soap opera a day and it seems to me and that's probably about once every two months since my husband retired it seems to me so often times that they cut into that soap opera with what i don't really consider as earth shaking i guess maybe i think sometimes the uh the coverage is almost too intent yeah i think so i i don't really think we need to know or even sometimes care so much about all the little nitty-gritty things they keep asking over and over i think think the reporters sometimes ask the silliest questions um-hum you mean when the reporter sticks the the microphone in the person says the face and says how do you feel that you house has burned to the ground yeah things like that are just kind of absurd or once in a while they'll they'll keep uh just hounding someone that they're interviewing that's a bit much isn't it um-hum and there seems to be no purpose um you know the person has stated you know some opinion or fact or whatever and that should be the end of it and they just keep on and on and on i guess maybe they have so much time to fill i've thought often times that maybe our world was a little bit better place when i was in high school and the world and the news like your radio station was on fifteen minutes in the evening and then they went on to i don't know i think the Andy Williams show or something that filled up the other fifteen minutes of that half hour and we just weren't so heavy with it uh-huh yeah well it's sure been nice visiting with you well you too we're having sleet and rain in Indiana this morning so oh well we're having sunshine i think it's gonna be up in the seventies today so oh well have a good day then bye-bye you too good-bye  back by that the um uh you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman how women have changed uh look at them in England um-hum um-hum Margaret Thatcher was prime minister uh Indira Gandhi uh in India so many uh women are heads of state and i you know we we keep saying oh yes we feel someday a woman will be president but i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that i think we'll have a black president before before we have a woman president um-hum and uh i don't know that that's bad or good it's just a point that i have observed that we yeah i i yeah i i i truly believe that that before that that we have to address the racial racial issues in the United States before we can go anywhere yes right um because it is so you know it a friend of mine went traveled to Belize and and into Honduras hello uh oh uh oh i think we're supposed we're supposed to hang up yeah well it wasn't the matter of wealth it was the matter that they were not wealthy that made them equal well i'll talk to you later okay bye-bye yes alrighty thank you bye-bye  okay uh could you tell me what you think contributes most to uh air pollution well it's hard to say i mean while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories uh pollute a lot um if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano uh it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all what do you think um well you talked about uh volcanos i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now and and what the amount of material that they do uh put into the atmosphere i think probably the greatest cause is uh vehicles um-hum especially around cities um uh do you live right in the city itself uh no i'm more out in the suburbs but i certainly work near a city uh okay so can can you notice well it's it's i live in a rural area how about you um-hum uh it's mainly farms and uh no heavy industry uh Attleboro itself i live in Rhode Island um-hum oh i see and it's in the north i live up in the uh northeast corner and Attleboro sits in just over the line um-hum where TI's plant is but there isn't a lot of heavy industry there's the freeways and we get an occasional well it depends which way the wind's blowing from Boston because we're only like about forty miles south of Boston so we'll pick up that um-hum and uh i've noticed over the past say maybe five or six years uh we live about twenty miles away from the state airport and i notice the fly patterns now of the jets are they getting bigger they're swinging wider so that now they're coming over the over the our homes um-hum and it seems like uh um we're catching all their residue i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping but other than that you know we don't have the unless we're catching it from the midwest the emissions yeah from the power plants yeah um don't you mean like from the coal yeah yeah we generate one of our our biggest electrical plants in Rhode Island uses coal to uh generate electricity um hm there doesn't seem to be much emission from them but i'm not sure about the rest of the country yeah i've noticed locally a major problem is Kodak um it's interesting because in order to uh keep with the EPA standards which which tend to be visible uh what's coming out of your smokestack they do all their emissions at night uh so people get up is that right yeah people get up in the morning in that neighborhood and they've got this black ash on their cars which you know seems to be yeah yeah yeah yeah surprise surprise yeah i mean i really think if the EPA had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades light up the sky photograph the emissions at that point and uh yeah them there must be uh um some of the some of the uh you know uh larger plants up around up around one twenty eight um we've got reports that uh during the night too like they blow off their their stacks from uh the um-hum right the boilerhouse for powerhouses and they do that at night too because employees been complaining that the cars have been pitted and you know spots all over them um-hum right yeah yeah so you're right they could do something about about that i guess yeah that seems a little ridiculous how are your uh your lakes and uh oh they've been getting cleaner they have sure but um yeah i'm not sure how much the water pollution is is directly related to the air pollution other than acid rain yeah acid rain yeah that's that's what i was uh i mean the stuff i've read recently in Technology Review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit um overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all um yeah i'm not an expert yeah no didn't they just have an article oh on uh they were dumping lime up upstate New York somewhere hm um over over huge areas and and they thought that was more beneficial because you know and it some of it does soak in and some of it runs off right away into the into the streams and rivers and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback i haven't read that oh yeah um-hum i can't remember where i i read that recently somewhere and i can't remember where but i thought it was up there so that's interesting because New Hampshire you know it's interesting um-hum and parts of Vermont um they showed pictures of of extensive tree damage that they attributed to acid rain um hm do you kind of think it's something else then well that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article so that oh they didn't say they didn't say what though they just said they thought it was they didn't say what they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um but it may be other natural things at work um hm natural disease yeah so it's it's less than clear like i said i don't remember the article that well yeah yeah but um i don't know i mean what do you think we can uh i guess as individuals or as a group do about uh air pollution uh we can demand uh more efficient automobiles for one thing i still think that's that's uh one of our major causes of pollutants um-hum uh how we go about that it's uh uh it's a little bit difficult so you think it's just up to individuals to ask automakers for uh less polluting vehicles yeah you need you need i think you need a a uh vehicle something like uh uh Ralph Nader uh Nader's Raiders or uh where uh or uh uh AARP yeah which has a lot of members uh if you can get those types of groups um-hum do you really think new vehicles though is a big problem i mean i remember reading an article that said like it's the older polluters the the twelve and the fifteen year old cars you know contribute like ninety percent of the automobile pollution and the new cars it's hardly it's hardly anything yeah they're better but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there uh when when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch smoke or uh or yeah but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune uh i'm not really sure you think that that the uh the trucking industry uh industry is that uh incompetent that they wouldn't you know fuel is is one of their biggest costs right so you would but diesel engines yeah diesel engines it you know it's it i mean they do generate a lot of soot but that at least you know that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly yeah yeah we could also uh push for legislation for uh rapid transit systems uh this country seems to be a little behind on that yeah on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient hm yeah but only because we got used to uh single person single car driving a lot of people don't even like to carpool um-hum um-hum but we could do that that'll help um-hum pollution air pollution the uh United States and Canada are i guess is is uh it going into uh some types of agreements to limit uh what's being given out by power plants um-hum i guess Canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there yeah sure so that's helping well what do you think about like a device a meter on right on a tailpipe and you paid a tax based on how much you polluted now that's an idea don't say that too loud though because uh every city and town will have a meter on your tailpipe generate generate revenue well it just means that if you don't pollute right or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax or you just buy one of these things and it it um i mean you could you could probably devise them so that it slowly closed off your tail pipe and uh the less you pollute the longer the device lasts and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tailpipe and you couldn't start your car anymore that's a that's an interesting concept is that your idea yeah but uh you know it's uh i guess the difficulty would be to somebody could obviously just take it right off the tailpipe again so you'd probably have to build it right into the muffler or something well i was gonna to say right you could put it in you could you could it could be installed like a catalytic converter i mean i guess you could take those off too but right you could take catalytic but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off yeah if you can take a muffler off and only replace well not unless it was built into every muffler right and that's but if you were just talking about something which was more or less universal that uh buses and any kind of vehicle had to pay a pollution tax um this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters that's a that's quite a concept you should uh pursue that i think or patent it you know yeah patent it that's a good idea if you could come up with a device that's the thing right but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that but that's a that's a thought no you're right and that will solve uh a lot of problems i don't know if you uh um-hum um-hum if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that um-hum uh but you know a proposal to uh uh i guess the proper authorities well you might uh generate some um-hum yeah the automobile regulatory agencies or something yeah you might generate some interest in it but that's a that's a good idea other than that i'm not sure what what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization um-hum  okay so uh do you own a PC um no not personally but yes uh-huh yeah several but you have one at work okay and now because um see i'm doing my uh Master's in Computer Science and Computer Engineering uh-huh and um and i don't i don't have one but i have to use them like during especially during my undergrad right uh-huh you you use um like your first couple of years you use personal computers because uh you know the software you know like it's easier for you to go and run a program you know through the disk uh-huh uh-huh because um the grader can do it at home then as the you know as you go up higher like in your senior level you're doing projects which are are so big and you have to have so many people sharing the same data yeah um-hum that you can't use personal computers so you have to use you know a main frame right right yeah i know i uh i do have a uh you know a computer at home but it's one that the company has loaned me and that that's been my situation is that uh that way i can get in access our um oh okay um computers that i have up here and you know do work from home but does it have uh like a disk drive oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh okay because uh the ones that we use you you know are like Unix base systems and so they don't have a disk drive you know so you can't you you the only way that you can do it is through a modem right uh-huh right right and you you know you just do it that way but that's uh that's the only way that you can get to through to the system you can't store it anywhere yeah right yeah no i um i i have both because that that's what i use all the time is Unix systems um versus the DOS but then i teach DOS classes uh at night uh-huh part time so oh okay and then you also have to do all your grading on the PC well that that's the really neat thing i teach in the continuing education classes so i don't uh i don't have to have grade any grades no grade books so that's great oh okay okay but uh no i find that i use the the personal computer a lot though for my WordPerfect and um also for my spread sheets um so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful yeah well uh for us it's uh uh you know it's like for doing like you know like resumes uh-huh and presentations we use like for example a Macintosh which is a lot easier for graphics than the PC than you know the IBM PC's or anything compatible with that um-hum yeah right due due to the fact that well you know i i haven't tested the the PS two yet but i don't know if the software is as easily you know like you can manage it a lot easier than than the old one the old one you had to go pick a line um-hum right use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start and where you know with the mouse you do it you know like a hundred times faster right that's true that's true and uh you also get you know when you see it on the Macintosh with you know the one i have that doesn't have any color you can look at it and that's the way it's going to print out uh-huh and especially if you have a laser printer it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen oh um-hum and so with you know with the IBM what would happen is uh since the software that i had was it was basically you know you only see part of the page um-hum and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain oh um-hum what a hassle yeah yeah and also you know it's like for for presentations it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a on a PC it can be easily represented on a on a PC you know like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all this all these numbers um-hum yeah and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not you know but with a with a new system i can calculate everything so fast you know like for spread sheets right yeah um-hum right right you can see what the trend is over the years yeah and i love all the windows that they have out now too they have really simplified things yeah that that i i had a i had a program due and uh one one window i had the program and the other one i had the program running so if there was ever a mistake i could easily check you know i could look at the program and say this is where i made the error right right right instead of saying where did i make the error you know go back and forth and and you know you always you know the old ones you had to go out of your program load up um uh-huh uh well load up the program again in this case after you load it up change it hope that's right um-hum get out of that run the program run uh uh as long as it took and then go back and see if that worked or not but with windows you can have the program and say it messed up in line fifty four yes yes yeah yeah so you take a look at line fifty four you take a look at the output at the same time and you can see that where it messed up because you know it's like in the old computers the ones that uh we're using here a couple of years ago you would always have to have a printout um-hum every time that you ran your program you would need a printout because everything else was erased in the background yeah right right yeah i know i uh i remember my college days and having to do that too did did you learn it in computer science oh yeah uh-huh i sure did and when was this uh i graduated in eighty six oh okay yeah so it's been fairly recent yeah i know because uh all i know is that when i came here in eighty seven they still had uh it was the last year to to put all your punch cards in the cards ah dear i didn't have to bother with that at all thank goodness yeah so yeah no but it it was just sensational because i walked in and they go oh my God they're still using this it was like this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out and you know yes wow wow you can get a hard copy of it and that's about it uh-huh wow so but i mean the price of computers has gone down they said that um if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since you know it started uh-huh they said that uh cars would cost two dollars and they would run forever oh that would be great so i mean it's like you know the the joke with the Yugo you know it's like yeah you you know like when your uh car runs out of gas just throw it away uh-huh uh-huh and that that that's the way it would be you know it's like wow yeah i think i'll buy a new car today you know so yeah but i mean the price has really gone down i mean IBM which um an IBM PC in like in nineteen eighty one it would cost you five thousand dollars oh sure oh sure and now you can get it you know like for one thousand dollars because uh you know because of the parts basically you know what right yeah and the two eighty six too so yeah yeah the the parts and the labor is what they're charging you they're not charging you you know over pricing it because it's like if we sell it for less you know it's like we're losing money you know it's like we want to sell it to break even at least um-hum right um-hum and i think they stopped producing the IBM PC um-hum and uh and the uh PC Junior was a total failure oh yeah to them they had uh they're trying to get out small computers but the only problem was that when they took that one out the small computer was the IBM PC and so you couldn't you know it's like sure bring out into the market something that's smaller when nobody nobody uses anything that's smaller than you know this you know and so yeah oh but over the past years IBM has been producing uh like every two years they bring out a whole new system you know like the P C B X T D A T and the PS one PS two things you know and so um-hum it's just that you have to always compete and uh Macintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools yeah because of of their you know you can work with it a lot easier yeah that's true so that's what they're trying to do oh well well i'll leave you back to your work and uh have a good lunch all right bye bye okay thanks bye  so what kind of eating out do you prefer do you like uh i don't know uh medium priced restaurants usually not anything too nice because we have a four year old uh-huh oh really so i usually like things that cater to children things that don't cost too much but you get your money's worth yeah and are loud so when he gets loud it's not too it doesn't bother the other people uh-huh but don't don't you lots of fast food too i hate to admit it but yeah but don't don't you like to get away from it all every once in a while and go to a nice quiet restaurant sometime oh yeah yeah then we go to someplace nicer quieter something with uh a cuisine that's a little bit you know more sophisticated like an Italian or French restaurant or something like that um-hum yeah there's uh Biraporetti's is one of our favorites it's real nice it's Italian uh-huh it's nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion yeah what do you like to do well i i personally don't like to go to Italian restaurants because i'm Italian and so that's just like everyday food for you huh well not really because you know i live i live here in a dorm i i still go to college but oh i i kind of don't eat Italian food if unless i go home because my mom cooks Italian food and it's like you know the you know she i i think that she cooks the best so there's no reason for me to go out and pay enormous sum for something that's just not as good hm yeah hers probably would be the best yeah but you know i also like the the fast food places like Taco Bell because you can get a lot of food for cheap prices oh yeah thirty nine cents or whatever for those little tacos yeah my son likes those yeah yeah fifty nine cents yeah so you knows yeah it's it's something that you know we we go there every Sunday me and my roommate go there every Sunday you know with our hangover from Saturday and we go to uh Taco Bell and get the tacos you know it's something it's it's cheap you don't have to spend a lot of money yeah and it tastes pretty much i mean i like the way it it taste good and it's fast i like that too yeah yeah yeah well i hate to cut this short but i think i better get back to work oh okay so thanks for calling bye yeah bye  okay what do you like to cook i like well i like to cook foods i like to eat i like to eat Italian food best and i find that i that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it's one dish meals type things and they're kind of convenient uh-huh um-hum that'd be good for a dinner party that you know to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things coming out at once is that what you usually cook when you have a party right um i usually have parties that are smaller groups i don't have i've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such uh-huh and so um yeah uh yeah i guess i usually do i like to cook um heavy sauces and um really that sounds good noodles and pasta and such ooh fattening yeah actually how about you what do you like to to cook um we it's funny that um we're talking about this we just had a dinner party and we had um our senior pastor and his wife came over um-hum and i catered to their diet is the only thing though so it wasn't something i really wanted to make i really wanted to make red beans and rice and with Anduille oh yeah you you know sausage because i'm from New Orleans originally and um i was gonna make that red beans and rice with the those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff um-hum and um a salad and then for desert i wanted i would i really wanted to make um just brownies or French doughnuts would have been good but it's real hard to make them they don't really come out like they do in New Orleans up here i don't know why oh i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have but humidity or something um that's what i want that's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that but um-hum kind of like the Italians it's really good but instead i catered to their diet so i made baked chicken in the crock pot and um it was good and everything it had all the vegetables in it but it seemed kind of boring compared uh-huh it kind of kind of down played compared to what you'd like huh do you find yourself um right with all the um cholesterol and and high fiber changing the way that you that you entertain i find it changing the way that i eat but not the way i entertain because i guess i guess i feel like um if they're on a diet like that i'm gonna you know honor that but if it's just another couple came over um couple weeks later and i made what did i make that night i made a roast and i made um um-hum oh i can't believe this my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday oh no i can't believe that anyway but um after when Ricky and Carrie came over we made um a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit and normally i don't eat we don't eat like that during the week because of the you know the calories and the fat in it but um-hum uh-huh you know when we're having guests we just kind of feel like just do it and i made blueberry cobbler and we had extra crust with it i mean it was so fattening but i don't think we gained any weight from it so yeah oh that sounds good well every once in a while i i think i feel the same way when i'm entertaining i don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really really like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play sometimes um-hum right i made a apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over and she didn't eat it oh yeah but i did bake apples so that it would be not brownies you know i figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies um-hum yeah yeah yeah so um i got a good brownie recipe oh that's good but uh anyway so i guess that's about what i do when i entertain uh-huh so do you have anything else you want to say about it or um nothing comes to mind right off so i guess not okay well it was nice talking to you okay bye okay you too bye-bye  okay uh you want to start by telling me what camping is to you do you backpack or hike or well uh a little bit uh nothing nothing overly strenuous no the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that no i've never done a canoe trip that sounds interesting oh it it's we've had a lot of fun uh i i moved to Dallas about five years ago and we've made three different trips since i've been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty the the last one we did and we haven't had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in Arkansas and the river was it was up about three feet so it was uh it was pretty it was pretty challenging i imagine but uh and then we uh as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it so they'll actually fit in the canoe and then you go for days at a time well yeah yeah it's the that that particular one was a two day trip so what uh uh there's uh there's a outfitter and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river God that sounds like fun yeah it it really is well the camping i grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type and uh you know that just either out in the woods or actually i i grew up water skiing i was uh from California and so we would go up to the Sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there okay okay and you just pick a campground on the river if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water right right you know cooled off but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked and so we did that uh okay i guess that we haven't done it since my kids were born so about three years ago and that was a new experience to me but i enjoyed it i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail didn't necessarily lead and where you couldn't necessarily pitch a tent boy i bet yeah uh-huh but uh that that was interesting i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that yeah that's that was uh that's always been our next step our our our little group of friends here we've we've been kind of getting married off and what not but uh that's don't let that stop you yeah that well it it it just puts a damper on things for a little while but we're we're starting to get everybody back together yeah we'd like to do a float trip down uh oh like Big Bend area or something like that i know yeah so you haven't done that before no no we haven't made that trip yet my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh Costa Rica and they took about two weeks and went into i don't even know the name of the river there but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience she said it was truly incredible i'll bet yeah and you know i there's that sense of it you know you're kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it uh-huh yeah exactly so well do you have anything planned for this summer um not really just yet we've uh well i i do have uh a little bit of property i grew up in South Dakota oh okay and i've got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet there's uh there's a little lake up there and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together and we basically own all the land around this little lake there it's divided up into ten lots oh so we've got a private lake and it's completely undeveloped at this point so that's a possibility and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime it it's it's about two hours north of Minneapolis i imagine oh that doesn't that sounds good so uh yeah in fact uh uh well i got married last summer and uh that's that's we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon we kind of took uh a tour of the United States for about a week that sounds and uh up through that area but uh my wife's real excited about it so we're uh we're going to hope to get up there sometime early enough last year it was the end of July and it was a little too late for the fish but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not we've been wanting to start camping again this year too uh my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half and then i have a little one that just turned two and we are in the process of potty training i didn't want to go camping with diapers uh-huh oh gosh yeah yeah you know i and and you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent they'd be awake all night that's right so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know she's not afraid of her shadow anymore that i'm i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it's like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh sure with little back packs of their own and you know things like that right you bet yeah we'll that you know and there's a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too that's just uh-huh well that's true you know it's like okay this this is this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know and okay now we'll go look for one and that kind of thing that ugh i would need that before i could teach them well yeah that's everybody everybody might learn something that way but uh but yeah that's there isn't there's an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that it's a lot of fun it really is hello  all right uh what kind of um besides your besides your salary what's what's the most the thing that you would consider to be most important as a benefit yeah well i guess uh i i i'm kind of in uh in an unusual situation probably for this particular topic because i'm self-employed oh uh have you ever worked for a large organization but yes i have worked i've worked for TI and i've worked for LTV oh okay uh and i suppose that uh so far as benefits are concerned the most important to uh me today would probably be uh something to do with retirement benefits okay at at this point in my life though i'm i'm i'm a little older probably than you know than the typical new employee would be anyway uh uh-huh in you know in my younger days i i was interested in what's the vacation policy and then as i matured a little bit you know i was more interested in what are the insurance benefits you know yeah but uh so i i you know i guess it from my point of view it depends on uh you know on where you are in life as to what's most important yeah probably because you said retirement and that really has not even occurred to me once and uh yeah yeah uh you know if you're not uh if you haven't haven't looked forward to you know what are you going to do when you retire uh-huh when you get to the point where you're looking forward to it then it gets to be important because you've got to do some planning for it uh you know especially if the company is not doing it for you yeah that's true that's true and uh there are you know there are companies that do and there companies that don't you know that don't have good retirement plans uh-huh uh i guess uh the companies that participate in the 401K type plans where you know you have the the uh option of contributing to uh to a retirement plan uh-huh and uh maybe even the company does some kind of a matching program for that that's those are good programs uh yeah i i i'm a CPA so i look at you know i get to see a lot of these uh a lot of different programs and things and along that line uh-huh and uh i like to see where the company makes those makes benefits available at least to the employees uh-huh so that they can pick and chose what they like uh you know there they've got one that they call a cafeteria plan i don't know whether you're familiar with that or not no what is that and uh essentially the cafeteria plans are programs where the company makes available a a different uh uh different packages of benefits you you know you can pick the kind of insurance you want and the kind of dental coverage and the kind of vacation policy you want an and all of these different things and you pick the ones that you want as long as the total cost to the company essentially the total cost to the company fits you know within their guidelines so every employee gets the same dollar amount of benefits but they can pick them from different whatever is most important to them um no i hadn't heard of that so you can uh so you can get you know you can get the insurance plan that's important to you and somebody else can get the vacation plan that's important to them and the company winds up paying the same you know the same amount for each one um is that something that you should change from year to year uh i believe that you can that you can change well maybe not from year to year but at least you can change periodically uh as to you know as to to get the stuff that's more important to you yeah that's uh something that the uh that the federal government you know put into uh you know into the IRS regulations as uh as that sounds like it might be a really good idea uh deductions uh allowable deductions for companies they put those in oh four of five years ago uh you know the the different insurance companies and things started promoting those plans uh-huh uh-huh and uh i i think there you know it's a pretty good option to have of course the 401K 401K is is a good you know it's a good savings vehicle yeah so uh anyway uh what kind of plans are you are you in now are what have you been in before well i think of uh you mean as far as retirement well as so far as benefit packages indicate in total i think the the most important thing for me right now is is really the medical coverage uh-huh uh yeah i am in uh in uh involved in a four 401K but i'm uh contributing such a such a small amount right now yeah just to go ahead and have the account open because uh yeah uh i just let's see i've been with this company for about three months and before that uh we were we're we're still in the process of trying to catch up yeah i understand that yeah we were we were way behind financially and so haven't really uh quite managed to catch up yet yeah so exactly and we're also trying to buy a house which complicates matters even further right yeah it's and it's uh it it's uh uh a hassle trying to to uh uh put your money all in the right in the savings you know in the right pockets i guess it would be a way to say it yeah you know to get everything do you have children and so so they i guess the uh no no that would complicate things even more yeah the yeah the medical insurance would really be a lot more important if you had uh if you had children i guess if you're of child bearing age then it's important too you know because yeah yeah that's probably you know because you got to have uh at least have the coverage in case that your in case you have another child or have a child uh-huh yeah that's true and uh you want to have that coverage so anyway uh but what else well there's lets see what other yeah uh i guess uh what what kind of typical vacation programs uh vacation plans do do the companies have that you've worked for uh so far as when you get vacation and how much it seems like everybody has it used to be that they used to give like two weeks a year and now they give one week after the first six months uh-huh yeah it's i have not uh i have not seen vacation policies you know written in about seven years so i'm not real sure how they're how they're changing what they're doing now most most of the time now they do the first week after the first six months so that if somebody really needs that time yeah yeah they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two yeah but uh yeah that's a good deal so it work it would work either way yeah how what do you what do you find that that they're uh when they change from two weeks to three weeks is it five years or ten years or probably five years i think yeah uh or seven uh that's kind of far away yeah so that's uh that's a that's a bit of a a wait to get i know that uh in the past i've worked for companies you know where they they had a pretty good uh pretty good plan uh vacation policy you know you got you got the two weeks the first year and then they went up okay um i've got another call coming in oh is that yours okay well and it's been nice talking to you okay all right bye bye okay thanks  all right uh i i would like to talk about just briefly what happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context i think it's uh refreshing to see the uh the support that the President got from the American people yeah it we i i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed uh that uh seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like uh uh President Carter and his thing with the the hostage crisis and he always did it through rhetoric right right and this time President Bush did it through action and he he drove policy um-hum by the course he took and almost forced public support or uh i mean he left almost no alternative yes that's right and and it was very interesting how he did it and uh i mean i'm i'm an Air Force officer so it uh it was interesting for me uh you know i'd certainly really uh i i mean i think it's great that all the support i have uh friends of mine from the Air Force i'm i'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory but other engineers guys here on base this is a B fifty two base where i work so right yeah we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it that's great um if if you remember the vote in the Congress to authorize war if necessary was actually pretty close yes it was and if if my memory serves me right i believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it yeah i'm i don't know the exact figure but i i would imagine that because of the it it was how close the the vote was i'm uh i mean almost certainly would have to be Just based on the sheer numbers of uh the disparity of excuse me Democrats and Republicans in Congress he'd think that it would have to have been that's right um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they're yep uh uh they're in in a sad way for ninety two now in terms of the presidential election anyway especially the ones that came out and said oh come on guys let's talk about this little while longer but yeah yeah i mean how many years are we going to wait and what what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time right right i think that was all those factors played a part in you know uh the everyone was no doubt discussing whether we should uh wait longer but i i i know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer but i think we were genuinely concerned about how their military capability and we uh i think we over estimated it but still we were really i think so too highly concerned about it and that we were worried that they were getting dug in and uh well they were and in fact they were so well dug in that uh when we sent our tanks around behind them they couldn't get turned around in time yeah right they couldn't yeah they couldn't yeah it's true they Saddam thought he had the whole thing uh figured out to to which way we were coming and which what what our doctrine was that uh well had had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor that's right that's true that's interesting i think uh this political situation over there now is uh uh it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the this opposition will uh uh today the Turks uh agreed to support the Kurds which is something they've never done before and uh hum interesting and uh this and the Israelis uh and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are uh are cheering for Baker on his drive for to reconcile relations with the Israelis so it's like well Baker is is really not very much pro Israel yeah i and did you know John Sununu is uh half Arab no uh i i think i did hear that at one time a long time ago because i used to live in uh Massachusetts but uh yeah right in fact when he was Governor of New Hampshire i believe okay yeah New Hampshire i believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back oh my gosh and uh now he is a conservative but he is not a conservative that favors Israel and that that concerns me greatly uh well i don't yeah i'd certainly uh support Israel in in their their policy that in defending themselves and in uh in their handling of their foreign policy i think i think the stand they have or or the way the command respect i i support that i think that is a a positive thing for them after um uh thousands of years they have to uh they had i think they in when they became became a country they more than or more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore and uh well they didn't have much choice they could either fight or die yeah exactly exactly and uh um so gee i lost my train of thought here but uh um so okay so i can't say whether that that i'm pro Israel or anti Israel i mean i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region and looks uh that the joining of forces for this uh uh Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing it is a positive thing um however uh every time an organization such as the PLO says well we'll see if we can work with Israel then uh they get embarrassed some every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them right and so you you basically have uh mutually exclusive interests either Israel is going to occupy the area or the Arabs are going to occupy the area and i'm just not sure that that there's going to be any easy permanent solution yeah somebody's going to and i think that's the problem the P L O has is that when they whenever one group of them decides that they're going to negotiate or they're going to do something they're going to try to make some peace but uh the end result is that they there so many factions of them and uh some more violent than others some with a certain agenda different than the others or they split they end up being becoming divisive themselves exactly uh i it's interesting i i'm i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh that's it is yeah i i commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks yeah i know that that is almost i mean that's absolutely unprecedented that was an an incredible foreign policy yep coup on the part of the President and the State Departme nt and that i mean that's never happened before exactly exactly no and i don't know if it will e ver happen again but may not well it's been fun i enjoyed enjoyed talking with you yeah okay uh i guess uh well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time you never know all right bye bye bye bye  what are your music music interests uh just about any kind of music except acid rock i i don't care for acid rock me too oh but uh i grew up with country and western but uh just about any kind of music i even like classical music yeah i did too and then yeah uh i'm pretty diversified too i i don't i don't like acid rock either i've i grew up in a small town so uh the only we only had one radio station so it was country music but then uh when i yeah yeah i grew up with Hank Snow and Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams and all of those old country and western songs oh really you're older than i am oh but uh i did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with James Galway we don't get channel two my our cable doesn't i wish we got that one it was it well we don't get channel two oh that was fabulous when yeah when he played Danny Boy it just almost brought tears to your eyes because he can make that flute sing oh really yeah and uh it was tremendous now he he is a good uh actually i did i played flute for almost ten years and and uh so i i i i appreciate his too his his music he he he's from Ireland isn't he yeah yeah yeah uh-huh and it was uh mostly all Irish tunes they they had a band with him that uh had a harpist and another flute and then was yeah guy that played the bagpipes plus the uh tin whistle and a couple of violins and a drum and they yeah um-hum they played all the Irish jigs and so forth it was just fabulous yeah i he he is really good yeah i've i've i come from a musical background so uh um i've played flute flute flute and piano so i i i have uh yeah yeah a big appreciation for music yeah up to a point i i'm getting now to the age where i don't like the new stuff that's coming and much of the new stuff that's coming out husband says i'm getting old yeah yeah yeah i love uh i like i especially like instrumentals do you yeah i love to just lay back on the couch and and turn a good good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen that yeah that that's nice to do that that is yeah i've got a i've got a two i've got a two year old who's now getting i'm getting well well versed in in kiddy music uh i'm i never played an instrument in my life i've always wanted to i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something yeah yeah well i was one of the forced ones but uh but i i'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music oh i could never do that i was never that brave but um yeah hm hm but i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir yeah oh yeah i've i've done i've done that at church too haven't done that in a long time yeah yeah so let's see what well what kind of music do you not like well like i say the acid rock i just do not care and i don't care for rap music either oh oh gosh that's not music that is not i don't know what that is but that's not music huh-uh no no if i can't understand the words i don't wanna listen to it well it's it's it's not it's not music it's just it's just uh uh beat talking in a beat it is just it's not exciting at all it doesn't it doesn't give you relaxation you can't dance to it you can't do anything to it yeah yeah yeah yeah right but i and i love uh i look at the orchestra music too like the Boston Pops or or anything did yeah have you ever been to the to to the Dallas Symphony have you is it are they good uh-huh yeah yeah they're good are they i i have never i've never been and uh we went and saw uh Les Les Les Miserables oh really oh the music in that was fantastic i've i've heard i've heard that that is a really yeah i heard that was hard to get tickets to yeah it it uh i can't remember how far in advance we reserved tickets but it was out you know out at the State Fair Music Hall probably cost yeah yeah that was a real and uh it was well worth the price yeah was it i i bet it was i bet i really bet it was is that the only uh musical do you go see musicals musicals a lot of musicals yeah just just ever so often you know a real a real good one like that one and yeah the that that would be that would be nice we went and saw uh i think it was uh Sugar Babies that was good that had good music in it was it i how how i can't i don't know what that's about uh that was the one with uh Mickey Rooney and uh oh what's that real oh not real old uh well she is old too dancer um i can't think of her name i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it Helen something uh oh oh i think i know who you're talking oh i know who you're talking talking about she's got black hair uh real long legs and dark hair yeah okay i know who your talking about i can't think of her name either yeah that was that was that was i remember that being uh here a few years ago i can't think of it yeah but uh oh oh the last country music my my parents still uh really like country music and they they like um they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Stadler Brothers and yeah oh yeah yeah and uh well my my my my parents Blackwoods yeah my my husband likes uh country music real well and he he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah and uh yeah he really likes Shenandoah yeah Alabama yeah oh yeah Alabama well yeah yeah Alabama i think they're i think they're a bit too over exposed i get kind of tired get tired tired of every other song being Alabama on the radio yeah but i yeah either Alabama or Hank Williams Junior oh i i i i've never cared for Hank Williams Junior i never neither and i never have figured out how he won the entertainer of the year for about three or four years in a row i oh we we watch those award shows too we like we enjoyed watching the country and the Grammies and stuff but i just i just don't care for him i just never have i don't yes yeah i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is uh probably Eddy Arnold is is it okay uh i i i think i i know who that is uh-huh i think my parents have have uh some of his records hm yeah um but i got about i've got about a hundred and or had a uh some uh i sold some of them i had about a hundred and fifty old seventy eight RPM records of country and western songs wow Smiley Burnette i don't know if you're old enough to remember him i've heard the name he was uh played in the old western movies he was the sidekick of Gene Autry i believe or they i think his name when in the movie was Froggy huh had had a real raspy voice i've i've never seen a Gene Autry movie hm and uh some of those old ones of course Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys and Ernest Tubbs and no i never have yeah Red Foley and yeah those go back quite a ways yeah i took them up here to Collectors Rector Records and was able to get a little money for them yeah but uh my mother mother and dad used to own a restaurant and they had a they had a uh nickelodeon of course in the restaurant and when they would come and change the records it's hard to find oh yeah yeah the guys would and the guy would give her the old records well that would that's neat so uh that's where i learned about that would be great great if they weren't too worn out at the time yeah course there's not a whole lot of market for seventy eight RPM records is there not you you'd well you'd think there would be well the problem is that most of the record players now will not play them because you have to have that needle that uh particular kind of needle well that's true oh yeah and uh they just won't play on a modern day uh well that's a shame phonograph because i i we go to antique stores a lot and you see seventy eights yeah uh a lot at at the store at at at or in record stores you'd yeah think there'd be a market for i i'm sure you could find old players for them but that'd cost a fortune if you could find them that worked oh yeah yeah course they you know just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because you you you get that scratchy sound no um-hum well those things were big and thick weren't they yeah yeah now you could kill somebody with them and the one you buy go out and buy one now and they're just so thin and flimsy and yeah they warped real easy yeah they just they're not meant to last at all no no neither are tapes i i i buy we buy cassette tapes and machines will eat them you did so you're best bet any day anymore these days is a compact disk those things are practically indestructible yeah yeah yeah yes but i i guess you know the old country and western music you back then when i was a kid there wasn't that much TV so that's all you had to listen to was the radio oh no radio yeah and uh that that's just what just what you had back plus i think it was better back then to the TV there's too much TV now yeah and the radio is you know more exciting really than than television kept your imagination yeah yeah was it it it kept it it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does yeah i remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opry oh yeah and was that on the radio every week yeah what what day what day was that on do you have you can you recall i i seems like it was on a Friday Friday or Saturday Friday  did they say anything no i guess we got ten minutes or something like that i don't know oh okay so what do you think um i think they should do it yeah i i do because um with all all the sports you know and everything they're doing there and also because whenever you're dealing with drugs like if you if you are on drugs then that affects the way you work and everything um-hum i agree but i think they're slow in testing you know i don't know yeah about yours but mines they so slow they tested some people twice three times and some people haven't been tested at all oh really um-hum well see um and i worked for a steel mill the past two summers uh-huh and i had to go through you know a physical and everything and before they even told you you were hired like they just called me in for an interview and i went in for my interview and then right there he said okay go down to the company hospital and you'll go through a physical so you know i mean it was really good that way because they they tested everyone right away um-hum and you didn't you didn't have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didn't have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body yeah yeah i like that i know when i i was in that like in the service and we didn't have we used to have to go every other month or whenever uh-huh to uh just do do we called it the golden flow but and they did random drug testing just because you know Uncle Sam but i've always thought that they were slow as far as outside of the government you know uh-huh because i've always i'm i'm use to it oh really it's no big deal yeah well see you know i well i guess if you're not doing anything it's no big deal people call it invasion of privacy not to me it's not because first of all if you're not doing anything they're not invading anything right you know and if you're taking medication from a doctor that's no big deal either yeah because like what because then they'll or you have a prescription yeah you know what too whenever they did that for me like you know we had to take they did it blood and urine and um they they gave you a paper right there and they said if you were out drinking or if you went out for a good time last night go ahead and write down that you did have beer or you did have alcohol or if you are on medicine go ahead and write down what medicine you are on uh-huh okay but i you know so they allotted for you know things like that like you know people didn't know they were being tested well you might have had a drink last night you know and that would show up too yeah yeah well see they don't do a blood test to us they just do a urine test which i think they should do a a blood test because then that tells them that you know they testing for drugs but i think it's like i tell and then you know they have all this smoking stuff why don't they just test for alcohol because that's between drugs and alcohol that's it um-hum that's the biggest killer there is i think they should do both of them um-hum you know because then that that way they'll they'll get rid of they can help the alkies and then they can help the people that's on drugs yeah and then uh it got you know it got backfired on a lot of kids too because a lot of kids you know um like you know like somehow they missed the physical or something yeah you know and they wrote down that they uh weren't but then they went back and they checked them like maybe a week after they were working and if they had drugs in their body i mean they were fired on the spot there was no ifs ands or buts about it oh oh yeah uh-huh um-hum i that's all right yeah yeah i think this way too because in that steel mill i mean someone and see some people always talk about the kind of job you do um-hum but it would that wouldn't be fair if they tested just people with strenuous jobs yeah because you know you you got your your your pilots and your your air traffic controllers your nurses your doctors uh-huh yeah yes i would want all those people checked but then you got your bus drivers your truck drivers are checked because my husband drives a truck they he has to pass a physical uh-huh you know but i think why don't they and and to me it's wrong to check just the people that you think are affecting the public yeah you know uh-huh why not just check everybody so yeah yeah see they checked everyone in the mill too and then that was hard because you know someone would come in and they had a problem well then if i like some of the jobs i was doing was very dangerous you know we were working with that steel that's thousands of degrees hot and i would have to cover for him you know like i would have to do two jobs for someone just because they they think they're being smart or something um-hum you know and i mean they even had um the the higher up management people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks you know yep so it was really good you know they were checking you know visually and uh with the blood and the urine tests well that's all right yeah i thought it was really good because they check our bosses and everything and i think that's the way it should be if they going to check you know that way you can't stay well they didn't check my boss you know yeah they checked him too so everybody's getting checked it's not like it's just little peons it's everybody uh-huh yeah yes right and that that's the way i think they should do it that way it is random you know it's random because some people is already gone two three times and some people ain't went at all uh-huh and they just when your number comes up your number comes up yeah right and then uh they checked us like once during the middle of the summer also um-hum you know like it's not like they just like well then the second time when i got hired i knew what was coming you know so then they checked us again in the middle of the summer yeah so i thought that was really good too i don't i well i think if you're doing something really bad it's going to show up uh-huh yeah you know yeah i don't think you can hide certain drugs no i think it what is it like i know even even like steroids well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body that's thirty days see so there still they said it was thirty days but on one of my our our thing is they said that you'd have to the way the test is you'd have to really be smoking for it to show up and i don't think that's right oh really i thought it would show up with no matter what amount we that's what he told that's what they tell you but i think it is i think it'd show up no matter what if you doing it then it's going to show up yeah and and steroids i mean that kind of drug that's a lot longer yeah that takes a lot longer to get out of your body i think they should check everybody everywhere that's working because see they got this and that's just like even all the football players yeah i think they ought to check them because you get kids looking up to them and here they are strung out on drugs what good is that you know that's not good that's right yeah and even and even uh i don't know sometimes i think they should even check the the music you know the entertainment oh yeah because the the with with uh the movie stars and and the singers and everything yeah because they get strung out too yeah they're no different um-hum but i guess you know that's they contract they don't and they're out winning awards you know and then and then the younger kids think they're great and everything but yet and then they're strung out on drugs secretly exactly you know they go off because they have a drug problem uh-huh huh-uh that's not right yeah you know what i think's i bunch of bull too is whenever um they um really you know like nationwide or you know popular people they do have a problem and they come out and they say they're having the problem so then they get more publicity because they admitted they have a problem and they're trying to fix it yeah well what about the Joe Shmoe who's an alcoholic and he's trying to fix it you know but he's not getting any he they're not testing him because they only testing for drugs yeah right and i think they should test for alcohol uh-huh because we have some alkies too boy you can smell it on they breath you know it's bad when you can smell alcohol on somebody but there's nothing you can do because they not drunk but you know they drink constantly to get that breath smell uh-huh yeah you know but i said no they they getting on the smokers and stuff but i think i because like i told one guy i says smokers don't kill people in a wreck from being smoking that's right you know drunk people kill people from being drunk that's true i never thought of it that way but that's true so why are you know why don't they just to me they ought to just do the blood test for alcohol um-hum and i said they'll have more people then yeah oh definitely i mean you know i can understand like on a Monday yeah but then you can look at it there too well alcohol's legal yeah but so is cigarettes yeah you know so why charge me more uh-huh so you know drugs is not is is is not legal some of them are yeah um-hum and some people are addicted to prescription drugs exactly yeah and so what's the difference um-hum you know they still got a drug habit but they're legal that's true they got a drug problem but it's legal you know it's like huh-uh huh-uh no they need they need some help too uh-huh um-hum um-hum because they check those and i know one girl she was on some kind of medication but see they didn't bother her because she had a prescription yeah but i mean what if she was hooked on them you know that's true how they going to know just because she has a prescription how are you going to tell if she's hooked on them you'd have to take her off them you know some people i mean that's they they they go off them and they they're going to die um-hum yeah so you need to to me if they going do a they need to keep checking like if somebody's got some drugs in they system um-hum and it's all prescription it's fine but what kind of drug is it yeah you know and then how long are they supposed to take it uh-huh if they people have prescriptions for Valium but they're not supposed to take Valium twenty four hours a days you know all the time that's for if they have a problem yeah and and then see that way you'll find out if they have a problem because if they keep taking it they have a problem yeah or they wouldn't keep taking them uh-huh and then also after you know they can find out whenever their prescription ends and then find out you know how long it will take for that to be out of their system and then test them again and test them again and see if they have it again uh-huh um-hum because you know they don't give you a whole bunch of them pills yeah because they gave my husband some when his mother passed but that was for like to calm him down right you know but see now they're gone uh-huh i think they gave him like four pills no and then that was it yeah yeah uh-huh but see now they they would be out of his system but if he was to be tested  okay where to start well i think uh i haven't had that much of course i just heard but i haven't had that much time to think about it either i guess the um biggest thing i find find find is the financial aspects uh particularly um-hum the ability of people to access you know your financial records or for example your credit rating uh rating um-hum almost at will that's true i didn't think about that and uh of course flying uh using your Social Security number of course permits people to do that um-hum and almost anything you do now uh a Social Security number is required um-hum and uh of course there's another aspect of this too uh in terms of invasion of privacy i just thought about it being a professional and of course you probably belong to one or more professional organizations and that is that some of the organizations sell their mailing lists um-hum which i think is a is an invasion of privacy i agree yes i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name um-hum and in fact some of these things i get some of these questionnaires it's funny because i'm i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call but um i haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything but when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it your salary information i i just have a real hard time doing that um and they ask you what type of household items do you own like stereos and TV's and VCR's and and you hate to send something off with your name and address and what types of things do you own and what kind of money do you make and you wonder well who's going to get ahold of this and think um that's a nice place to go rob and not only that it it opens you to phone solicitations right and i i've noticed more and more i would say over the last six months um-hum i am getting more at home phone solicitations um-hum for a variety of things from i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner carpet cleaning i've had them for carpet cleaning i've had them for of course for you know real estate investments know you get uh um-hum please send in your uh you know this particular card and you get uh a free trip or something along those lines right and so that uh that bothers me because i of course i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers um-hum uh particularly solicit you know soliciting so having your and i know that a lot of these of course are random phone calls they just you know start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers um-hum but some of them are sold and i know you talking about mailing lists the i there is one particular group to which i belong and for some the reason they have three different names hum for me now the address is the same you know my my office address um-hum but they have one under you know my first name James they have one under my first name and initial middle initial then they have a a third one under my just my two initials um-hum um-hum and i get mail um-hum here at home under each of those names oh no so i know that they have sold their mailing list right and uh i think those two things bother me more than anything else as far as an invasion of privacy yeah and uh i can't really think of anything else offhand that uh i think i dislike the phone number part the worst i mean it's it's one thing to get junk mail because you can you can just put it right in the trash but it's the phone calls and you know usually when they call you it's going to be when you sit right when you sit down to dinner because they know they pretty much know that you're at work all day and they call you right when when you've just gotten home from work the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's you know something halfway enjoyable but if it's a salesperson it's just something you don't want to have to mess with and and i've gotten a lot of them lately or i'll sometimes i come home from work and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day and i wasn't home and they'll probably call me up and you know call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on but um-hum i find that very annoying the uh mail stuff yeah you know it's kind of irritating but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls i think you i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity you know to talk um-hum and see what's going on and all those things even if friends call um-hum it irritates me so i try to i actually during that period of time yeah from you know usually from six o'clock or six thirty whenever i get home until eight or so i will shut off the phone um-hum and uh my daughter gets irate when i when i do that because you know she's a teenager um-hum uh oh so she'll you know why are you cutting off the phone i might get an important phone call so right so those i guess those three things are the uh um most irritating to me um-hum i agree with the phone too in that i'm single but when i come home from work there's times i need to pay bills i need to balance my checking account i need to do all kinds of different things like that and even though it's friends calling sometimes you just feel like this is my quiet time i need to get things done and the phone ringing bothers me but that's that's where answering machines are nice because if it's really important they'll leave a message and i can call them back but uh at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in sometimes it is just that's right i just want to get away from the phone ringing because it it really does annoy me and uh if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally we have uh like this past week we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system and uh phone rings like crazy and you come home and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone and if it's some salesman that just makes it even that much worse and uh it just i get to where i i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone but now with this thing i'm participating in i kind of have to answer it because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's uh you know somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone well i have you know we have a you know voice mail system at uh at the office um-hum now what i have done is i have forwarded my home phone um-hum to the answering service at the office uh-huh so that i do not have to have a um a ring at all a ring at all oh huh that's an idea if i if i want to do that right and uh or i will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to uh to the office um-hum and so it's you know it makes it convenient but at the office when i you know we can uh on our system and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service yeah ours is that way too and when i when i want to be you know not bothered during the day that's exactly what i do um-hum and so uh well yours is probably the same as ours it's uh Tigon isn't Tigon uh part of GTE or vice versa or something like that uh seems i read yeah well Tigon is part of GTE okay okay that's it that GTE had purchased Tigon and yeah that's what we have um-hum except we call it Aspen but Aspen hum yes and uh we i couldn't remember in Tigon had purchased GTE's phone mail services or if GTE had purchased Tigon i knew there was some type of a tie in there i remember reading in the paper a few months back but yeah GTE purchased Tigon okay and so we have have been using a the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon um-hum so i imagine we will be uh shifting over to that service um-hum uh for a while or if in a while uh-huh as soon as we determine what we're going to do with Contel after we bought Contel oh no yeah oh Dana i think we have probably conversed long enough well all right i think we did that's good i didn't think we could go too far on this privacy thing but uh i guess it's close enough all right well thank you for calling i had i i enjoyed talking to you sure good talking to you Jim all right bye-bye take care  okay so have you seen any good movies lately uh well let's see i think the best one i saw was probably Sleeping with the Enemy oh i haven't seen that one yet have you seen Silence of the Lambs uh no i haven't seen that one yet either oh well tell how about uh Awakenings no but i've heard it's really good okay well have you seen LA Story no i haven't seen that did you uh yeah i have what did you think of it uh well it was it was entertaining it was funny Steve Martin did a pretty good job huh yeah uh it's uh they portray the LA lifestyle uh-huh and it's uh quite a lot uh crazier in the movie than it is in actuality i've been to Los Angeles before oh really and nothing's as crazy as what they how they uh uh describe it in the movie yeah well i saw a few of the uh little coming attractions you know it looked really cute but it's kind of fun if you've been there before you'll you'll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie yeah well i've never been to California i've lived in Washington but not California so okay i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with uh Victoria Tennant as his uh love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality oh i didn't even realize that that's interesting hum so that added something to the movie yeah i guess so did you see Home Alone no i haven't seen that one yet either oh well i was kind of disappointed in that one okay i've heard so much about it that you know it's such a great movie and you ought to go see it over and over again and uh i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble yeah i i heard that uh it was a little pretentious that the family was very wealthy and uh-huh it just didn't uh appeal to uh to as many people as it as it could have yeah yeah i was kind of disappointed but um are you intending to see Silence of the Lambs have you yeah i've heard that's really really good uh friend of mine at work saw that yeah it's pretty intriguing yeah it's it's a very unusual movie kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasn't as scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way well i understand it has a real complicated plot yeah yeah it really does the only way they can get any information is through someone who's so crazy and bizarre it's hard to tell what he's going to do next so yeah so it was a good movie uh-huh and then i thought Sleeping with the Enemy was even scarier but that's because it was about a man chasing a woman and that's my big fear so okay yeah um i was trying to think if i've seen any others lately but that probably pretty much sums up i don't get to go to the movie too much you seen uh Ghost no i haven't as a matter of fact it's on at the dollar movie around here and i was wanting to go yeah it's been out for quite a while already yeah i heard it was really good that is a is it is a very good movie yeah uh Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore did a really good job very uh uh emotional put it that way uh yeah um-hum yeah yeah that's the way i understand as a matter of fact my sister believes in uh ghosts and she said that she thinks that's a real uh true portrayal of what it would be like well that's interesting the special effects were great i have to admit that yeah yeah i i want to see that as a matter of fact i intended to go one night and didn't get to so okay hopefully we'll go soon you seen uh Edward Scissorhands no i haven't oh it's as a matter of fact i don't know anything about that movie what it is is that funny or it's uh yeah it's somewhat of a a bittersweet comedy huh it stars uh Johnny Depp uh-huh he's uh from 21 Jump Street right and uh he portrays uh Edward Scissorhands this uh creation of uh Vincent Price uh kind of a uh scientist hum who uh creates a person uh out of uh oh just uh spare parts and i guess uh cookie cutters or whatever oh really huh it it's kind of interesting he he doesn't complete the job though and his hands are are are not finished so he has scissors on the ends of his arms yeah oh oh huh and uh is is found in this uh castle by uh oh it's the local Avon lady or something like that uh-huh and she takes him into her house and uh he learns what life is like uh in a uh moderately normal suburb oh well that is interesting it's uh it it is entertaining it's kind of like a fairy tale yeah huh with a sad ending but uh yeah oh it's uh uh it was different yeah well that sounds pretty yeah is it something uh that you could take a child to a fun movie oh yes certainly um-hum oh i have a six and a half year old that'd probably enjoy that oh i think it'd be great for a for a a child yeah huh it does have a a a fairy tale like uh quality oh oh well i'll have to that have to take her to see that scenery is is very entertaining uh and what he does with the with the scissors and uh um-hum uh doing uh certain types of landscaping uh working with shrubberies hum uh he uh carves out different figures in t he in the plants plants shrubs oh really huh wow that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make uh yeah i they spent they evidently spent a lot of time on uh on the scenery for that the special effects yeah i can imagine have you seen The Field over at the Inwood no i haven't that's i thought that was an outstanding film huh i don't know anything about that either with with Richard Harris uh-huh uh he plays a uh kind of a patriarch in uh Ireland nineteen twenties Ireland um-hum uh-huh and uh it's about a uh piece of land that he rents uh he works uh a piece of land and rents it from uh an old English uh widow hum but uh he he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and won't allow anyone else to uh to uh control that land and when the widow puts it up for uh for sale uh he claims that it's his even though he cannot afford uh the price the price hum um-hum it uh goes to an American American uh who has uh ancestors from from the area um-hum he's trying to uh apparently trying to uh uh gain some background on his his heritage from uh Ireland so he's buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area um-hum hum and uh there are just a lot of uh interesting i have never been to the Inwood theatre well they well they have more of of the artsy type of uh films a lot of foreign films there um-hum yeah do you go there often no not too often uh but uh this was a uh just a good opportunity to go see that movie it was uh yeah hum i really enjoyed it yeah well it sounds interesting well does this um however this is set up tell you when you've talked for five minutes or well they cut you off after ten do you oh really oh that's interesting yeah oh okay well i didn't know this is the first call that i've made so i wasn't real sure if you oh okay if it tells you when you've talked long enough or let me think if i have seen anything else that's interesting lately well getting back to uh to that other uh film uh with uh which one was that with Jodie Foster uh-huh yeah Silence of the Lambs um-hum uh Silence of the Lambs yeah i didn't really care for her her earlier films uh Taxi Driver or The Accused and i was kind of wondering if this was uh a little different style um-hum um-hum oh i'm sure departure from what she's done before i haven't seen either one of the other films she was in but uh my husband said that he thought she was playing a real different role in in this show yeah okay see i never did care for her too much in the other films so yeah friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different that uh she's really good yeah i i one of the things that i was really impressed with uh she has to have an accent that she does a real good job with i it sounds so real that she sounds like she's from that area of the country all right that's interesting because i yeah uh i think it's like in the i don't know Alabama Georgia South Carolina area or something it's and she does a real good job sounding like she's from that area okay but um i thought she did a really good job well that's good i'll have to go see that yeah it's been highly recommended the man that plays this bizarre character is really i don't know if i've ever seen him in a film before i don't even Anthony Hopkins oh with Anthony Perkins yeah i didn't remember him from anything else i i'm sure i've seen him in other movies but he looked so his his face the entire movie just haunts you uh-huh and uh he did a real good job sounds like i'll have to go see that one soon yeah yeah there was a big crowd there i think it's uh definitely getting some good ratings okay yeah Sleeping with the Enemy with Julia Roberts i haven't seen Pretty Woman yet uh have you seen that one um-hum no i haven't because she was just on uh the People's Choice Awards the other night oh really and won uh a People's Choice Award for uh best uh female entertainer hum as well as uh an award for this movie oh i didn't realize that well i thought it was i really enjoyed that movie i mean it scared me more than the other one but it was real intense to me i enjoyed it okay well i'll have to go see that one too yeah yeah it was it has a real eerie beginning and the man that she's married to is obviously crazy but at the first you don't really know about that and it's real interesting the way it starts out so uh i thought it was really interesting sounds like another obsession type movie uh like Fatal Attraction yeah yeah it is it's a lot like that i thought Fatal Attraction was a good movie did you like it uh i thought that uh the movie the movie that it was based on was better i didn't like the ending but oh really that was uh which one was that with uh Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills hum it came out in nineteen seventy trying i didn't know it was based on another film oh it was called Play Misty for Me um and i thought that was a very good film and Fatal Attraction was on the same theme almost identical um-hum oh i see huh but uh i didn't care for Fatal Attraction as much huh well i liked it until toward the end i i didn't care for it too much but no it gets quite violent yeah yeah and it's kind of unbelievable too yeah the this woman can live through everything she lived through right yeah well well i can't think of much else to talk about okay well i think we're reaching our limit anyways so yeah i think so well thanks for calling all right i appreciate it thanks a lot bye uh-huh good-bye  you want to start well i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged and therefore having seen the last generation i guess it puts me in you know gives me a perspective on that yeah um i am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women in both in society and in the work place uh there's no doubt about the fact that when i first was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office but not necessarily uh now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where couples uh are more carefully planning their intention on how to share both share homemaking duties and also how women will uh have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place and i guess that's a significant change that of i've both participated in and and noticed i agree um the equality of uh the roles now between the sexes i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war especially compared with uh the Vietnam war and you see women going off to wars as well as men uh-huh um i have wondered why they allowed or let you know both the father and mother go uh and the children are left without either parent now to me that's kind of a drawback but uh i guess it's a price you pay and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the uh uh day care centers wonder about them in what way well uh from what i understand there's been studies that uh these children are uh more rebellious uh they term it as more uh creative uh-huh but uh that they uh are much more contentious so i i don't i i guess we'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up you know in in a uh kind of a uh community uh-huh rather than a home i have not to be honest had much experience yeah with children in that situation i i guess one knows one's own storly and i know uh in my children's case it was one where uh pretty much up until the older of two was in uh let's see i guess basically starting junior high and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force uh-huh um so i guess my experience is is just with what we did and and so they didn't really go through the child care route they were able to be home together so they yeah um and we never actually experienced that what in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and and potential changes over the the next generation or so i guess i anticipate um an increasing equality uh greater presence of women in management roles uh-huh um i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of of surrogacy that we see i just don't know what do you mean um deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother oh yeah sort of rent a mom to be you know not to be crass about it but uh yeah that's strange uh whether one might conceive no pun intended of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate uh um a nanny sort of a professional mother a person uh-huh uh-huh for instance that and i could you know i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting uh uh story or whatever i i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that in fact i think it sort of raises yeah nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession that's right that's right uh um i i don't have a other than than a reading and and male perspective on on the various on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not uh i know that that my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent i i don't know that i uh felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs uh-huh uh i don't have boys that doesn't didn't bother me never has vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or or as a professional nanny nanny as you put it uh yeah maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes uh a career out of say taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care uh-huh uh-huh it would be a sort of day care but it would be more of a family setting right um i know that there are young people characterized i guess as being half my age so that by definition that means they're young uh that in my work place who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman uh eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child i could easily envision that pardon to come in and live with them to come in and live with them or to put their child into a setting into a home setting where they would you know like they they would get leave at eight in the morning and and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids and uh-huh yeah and you were paying for really high quality care right uh i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures on on the order of what i quoted to someone because that's what the experience they want and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that that's a possibility of a change that we could see in the next few years uh-huh and then you might have more control over uh the the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center um-hum um-hum i know the day care centers are not cheap either you know they're i haven't ever really looked at them are you aware at all of of what they would what they cost uh well no i just know i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it they have to go with the a single uh what i mean a babysitter more more or less uh-huh but i think it's like about sixty dollars a week for two children if i'm not mistaken uh-huh and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation you know and taking care of the children or if the children are at home at home sick uh-huh i mean that is you know just a a rate that you have to pay and uh what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society uh i think i really don't have a vision that's okay too yeah i um i think that they will be more in the work place because uh the door's open uh-huh and uh it's just human nature to walk through an open door so and i would be glad to see that i hope i don't see a lot more single moms but i it seems in my experience i'm running across single women all the time i'm i'm noticing that too and and i notice the the a terming emerging called solo parents that i am very aware of yeah the number of solo mothers that that i encounter in the work place and that that is a little troublesome yeah yeah uh because the pressures on them are are rather rather formidable it's awful yeah uh and maybe that's a change we'll see maybe uh possibility the possibility of of women uh who deliberately say no we'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps in the event of a separation or whatever uh-huh right so well i think we've done it thank you very much it's been interesting well i think we're about done okay uh good bye you take care bye okay bye  so huh what do you think should they uh should young Americans be forced to do a year of service i don't i don't think they should be forced but i think they should be encouraged i guess encouraged to to do some kind of public work i guess just to get them i guess involved with community maybe you know just community activity if nothing else see how the city works stuff like that yeah i think something like the Peace Corps is a bit harsh yeah i i think so too i think that's a bit dramatic but but other than that i think it it's a good idea to get them involved in the city and community activities and you know like the uh shelters and you know kids uh that kind of thing helping out uh volunteering i guess if they can move on yeah i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two and and and force them i think that uh i think it'd be i think most i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work and no one just realizes it yeah you're right i do too i think they start out young like in uh Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts doing stuff right exactly i was a i was a Boy Scout and as part of being a Boy Scout you had to do you know projects all throughout and then to become an Eagle Scout you have to spend a do a year long project for exactly right that's see that's what we did in Girl Scouts and and that got you involved real good and it i think it starts kids out on the right track and it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing something yeah i think i i now i think people generally volunteer that that there's no problem with getting them to to do stuff yeah i do too i think i think a lot of people a lot more people volunteer than than uh than we than get credit for it as you know like in hospitals and uh and the shelters and stuff like that and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know perhaps helping and helping out i think that's good and well we have a funny commercial around here it says something like if people were to give five hours a week or five percent of their salary we could they could solve all the world's problems or something so i guess if we all give five hours a week or five percent of our salary we could uh or just or just gave or or just or just forced our kids just to force kids to serve for uh parents i guess yeah yeah i'll be yeah there you go that's substitute my my yeah my kid'll do uh four or five hours this week for me no problem hey yeah it sounds pretty good that sounds good i've noticed a lot of uh different organizations in our community uh pick up like on the highway and stuff and i think that's pretty neat they uh go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over and they clean it up oh i i've seen that yeah and keep it clean i think that's a pretty good idea and i think you know again i've seen a lot of young kids doing that and i think it gets them prepared to to learn how to volunteer as they get older i know i did you know in like Girl Scouts and everything and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff like that so they they just started trying to get them together like like like like that around here from for from the community because uh we had a big ice storm uh very very recently you don't sound like you're in the north you sound like you're in the south somewhere oh yeah i'm in Texas where are you at yeah uh i'm in uh New York upstate upstate upstate New York yeah and uh long way uh New York oh gosh yeah yeah and we just had a really big ice storm and basically half the trees in in in our city i'm in Rochester which is uh right upstate half of the trees in the city um-hum um are no good anymore and that's how bad it was everything is just down everywhere you know we had three hundred thousand people without power oh no oh golly you know it was and you know and and they and we didn't have power for a week and there are still people who don't have power it's it's oh yeah it's been over it's been ten days already and there are still something like are you serious oh ten thousand people without power and were officially yeah and we're officially in a state of emergency funny thing is the news the national news how they covered it um oh my God how do they live yeah i haven't heard a thing yeah i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days you know we just got our phone back today uh oh Lord God and and they're you know putting out ads and now for people to come volunteer or to have their organizations come volunteer to help clean up the streets well that's good that's great because we have you know everywhere everywhere that a tree is down people need help and we're all all a lot of older folks need help getting their yards cleaned out because they can't afford to pay anyone and they and and they certainly can't carry it themselves and so right yeah yeah right right that's one thing we do at our church is um we have a group called Hearts and Hammers and we go along and i'm really not sure how we find the individuals but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that need desperately need it and uh we go along with all the material and in one day more or less go in and say roof paint fix whatever we can oh that's great yeah and spend a day doing that's really neat i mean it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time but you know every little bit helps and is that supported by all donation to the church and so forth or uh yeah they uh luckily we have a a man who owns a building company oh so he so he donates a lot not everything but a lot of the material then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy that's real nice yeah and it's not you know we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it you know so much as we just want to help people out so it's real neat it's right that that that's real good and i and i bet it gives you a real good feeling to be doing that yeah it's like i say it's not a lot but it helps people like this last couple we helped you know they were in their eighties and she was bedridden and i just you know it just tears your heart out to yeah to see this kind of thing and you know if you can do any any little bit it helps so that's that's uh that's real good we had uh we had organizations like that in college you know we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups and some did like that some did elderly visits some did um yeah yeah some did you know Big Brother Big Sister stuff like that and i'm convinced that that that at least twenty five percent of our school participated in some sort of uh some sort of group you know activity activity like that you know twenty five i don't know twenty five percent yeah my wife was big in that and she thinks yeah twenty five percent it's it was a small school but um gosh that's great that's a lot that's that's a lot of kids though oh well still that's a lot you know that's a good chunk of kids yeah but i mean a a a lot of people would get involved and you know because there were all different organizations to do there was Big Brother Big Sister they had a yearly auction they had a dance marathon for charity or to to to support that group yeah yeah that's neat such that you know lots of people got involved that way that's great that's great but uh like i'll agree with you though i don't think they should have to do a year yeah yeah no neither do i i think it should be completely optional and you know yeah i don't think that some people i don't think have uh a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean they're not worth it yeah they're not worth a year or some people unfortunately just just can't even afford it you know or whatever i mean the Peace Corps doesn't pay very well right oh yeah that's true that's true you know people get shipped off and then you know and then and then their parents i have a um a a friend whose whose son is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala or daughter is in the Peace Corps in Guatemala right now oh oh oh and you know he and his wife just went off to visit her and you know i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in Guatemala i i couldn't either i couldn't either you know so so i think you know and and and the kid's certainly not making much money right right so i can see where that that may be a problem yeah i just know one person that's in the Peace Corps and i mean she's a teacher and and just wanted to do it she'd been a teacher for a while just decided she wanted to do it so i mean i'm grateful for people like that but i don't see how they can just just take off a year yeah just pick up and head on out i wish i could do something like that but right yeah i don't yeah well neither can i so i i i i i i did my service before and i'll do my little community service throughout but never never for a year again i can't so right that's the way i am i know the feeling but so right so i guess our vote is no that's right we're against it well it's been nice talking to you i guess that's right you too and i hope everything works out up there well yeah we're we're slowly getting everything back together again you know it it's taking time but everything you know we got lucky we had no damage to our house or anything so the rest'll just have to come with time yeah good good that's great yeah well good luck well good luck to you too bye-bye thanks bye  okay so what do you think well i believe in capital punishment um and i i think the way that i understand the laws right now they are only for certain crimes um i'm not sure exactly what they are i think rape and uh uh-huh capital murder yeah the person gets killed you know oh yeah that would be a capital crime yeah yeah something like that but my problem with capital murder capital punishment is they don't carry it out yeah i agree they so if they're going to have it to me they ought to do it i agree they uh you know they people people been sitting like they had on 20/20 or 48 Hours one of them they had them on the man was twenty years waiting on death row uh-huh see that don't make no sense yeah i think that we waste a lot of money keeping people in prison yeah that uh is not necessary and now i think they ought to increase it to all these drug dealers yeah have you ever been on a jury huh-uh i haven't either but and i you know i i have real strong beliefs in capital punishment but when it comes right down to it yeah i i'm wondering though they're not going to do it that's my biggest problem is even if you give them the death penalty they appeal it and appeal it and appeal it and there's you know right but what if they're not guilty huh what if they're not guilty what do you mean what have been what if they truly are not guilty and they're convicted anyway that's the whole system though isn't it yeah see that's what there are a lot of people that aren't guilty that's in jail yeah but you know uh i i i don't know about if you if they was like capital murder and then if they were married then what would you do yeah i don't know you know like i said said i do believe in capital punishment but if i were sitting on a jury and had to make the decision i wouldn't want to have to be the one to make it yeah and i do agree that they keep people that we spend too much money keeping people in prison the jails are overcrowded if they're going to do well you know let's do it uh-huh do it and get it over with i don't know if i could i could probably it depends on the crime my problem would be that like people to me the like the child people the people that's killing kids uh-huh uh the ones messing with old people yeah those type of people now i i have no pity for them yeah you know but just like if a man and wife is fighting and he kills her that he shouldn't die because it might been accident or you never know what you know what what they done went through together should i say yeah but i don't know if they if they if uh the death penalty i don't think they give them the death penalty if given today anyway yeah yeah i don't think they give it to just i think they just put them in jail and let them think about it yeah for a long time so i don't know uh i definitely think anyone that kills somebody should be in jail i don't think everybody that kills somebody should die yes die because it all depends so under the circumstances there's a lot of circumstance sometimes i even feel like and up in another state i think it was Ohio where they don't have uh self-defense laws and i think that's wrong is it i i'm from i've lived in Ohio and i didn't realize that yeah they had them on the news this lady her husband she was seven i'll never forget it because she was seven months pregnant and he hit her in the stomach and then tried to cut her throat um oh my gosh well she shot him and she went to prison she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that's not right um huh-uh they she's nothing should have happened to her at all he shouldn't have hit her in the stomach i don't care well see he shouldn't have been trying to slit her throat anyway but he did both yeah well i wonder why did they say why well he was he he she was abused woman he was he was a a what do you call it abuser he would he would beat his wife all the time oh so there was a history of that oh yeah so she's not going to get to have her baby she no she lost the baby oh okay he hit her in the stomach with the shovel oh it's just you know things like that that you know i don't think those women or even a man because a man they had a woman man that his wife shot him but he didn't die uh-huh and uh they put her in jail now i don't think anything should happen to him but i think she should stay in there because really she just did it because she wanted to get out the marriage and she wanted all his property uh-huh see i think that's wrong too but i don't cheaper than a divorce no she she wouldn't have got no property see there was no grounds for divorce she was she wanted out cause she had a boyfriend and it was weird but uh the capital punishment i don't know actually what they give the death penalty for yeah um the only thing i i know they give it for is shooting a killing a cop or you know assassination of the President and and something big you know yeah i think capital crimes uh capital crimes and i want to say kidnap i don't know why kidnapping sticks in my mind but um uh-huh i don't know yeah i think they should give it to them but i don't think they should keep them waiting in jail and let having us pay for it for twenty years no if they going to give it to them i think they should go ahead you know okay maybe a year or you know like that two years whatever but twenty years ten years on death to me that's worse for them too yeah they're not they don't know when they going to die they know they got the death penalty but that don't mean nothing not anymore well i i assume that you live in do you live in Texas uh-huh i think Texas is very uh one of the leading states i mean i think Texas executes more people than just about any other state i don't know they don't they don't put it on the news or they don't broadcast it because you know the i guess they don't just don't well they they they they don't sensationalize it anymore they used to make a big deal out of it every time it happened uh-huh oh yeah all the people for right uh life or something and i think now that it happens more frequently than we know that it's just not sensationalized as much at least in Texas because i hear every once in a while i'll hear something on the news yeah yeah i but i think they going to have to do something to make people wake up like on especially the drug dealers you know the the not the little penny ante ones on the corner i don't think they ought to get in trouble i mean i know they ought to get in trouble i'm not they ought to get in trouble but not not death because see they you know we're to me what they ought to do if they can find the big man but they ought to get yeah i was because see that's where it's coming from to me it it's coming in here some kind of way i don't care what anybody tells me people tell me i said if the government really want to i think it's all government something to do with the government i really do they because if you can stop uh Cuban cigars from coming you can't buy anything Cuban in the United States so why can't they stop anything illegal yeah hum you know if they really wanted to i think they could they just don't want to put there's too much money people's been bought out you know and that's what's wrong with some of the kids on the street yeah they you can't blame just like the man says he can make two five hundred dollars a day for just taking a bag somewhere uh-huh and his mom is not getting that much money hum you know if you think you think about all the kids in the ghetto my mom would probably kill us but but uh you know it's something that has to be done to me if they bring kids into it because now kids are killing and so they going to have to do something with the death penalty or to scare these people i think that's the whole thing they're not scared they know they're not going anywhere yeah well yeah i mean when when you think about it yeah when you think about how many people die from drugs you know ultimately uh-huh innocent people not just the drug people i'm talking about innocent people when they have they little drive by shootings and and and see because i'm from Los Angeles oh yeah um see originally i've been in Texas twelve thirteen years but originally in LA they people die all the time just from being in the way at the wrong place you know see you know but i think something should be done for them yeah um yeah so i agree but i don't know too much about the death penalty i think that that they have much i like that they've changed it to lethal injection rather than you know the electric chair or gas yeah but they don't use that no more no they don't they use the the injection thing or whatever it is yeah i think that's a lot more humane than uh than the electric chair than the than the gas or the gas uh-huh it's funny because i had listened to a comedian talk about the death penalty you know about people saying they they don't have nobody to do this and i said well if somebody killed my husband just because i'll pull the switch i'll even do you know to me if if that person can forgive them fine but what is that man going to do next is he going to go out and kill somebody else kill right you know how many times is it going to take for this man to kill people before you kill him yeah now you know sometimes i can understand maybe if they robbed something they didn't mean to do it okay but how many times you going to go by that how many times you going to this person keep killing so i don't know uh-huh yeah i guess if you stay out of trouble you don't have you worry about it but well it's like you said though sometimes people just get caught up in it innocently but uh-huh so i think it just i think it depends on the circumstances and how many times that person has been in trouble i mean really big trouble yeah yeah you know so yeah but that's all i got to say okay and it is nice talking to you all righty well it's nice talking to you i'll have to start doing this again some more i i don't know what i've tried it several times with oh it's fun i call  okay what do you think about the idea of uh okay kids having to do public service work for a year do you think it's a well i i think it's a pretty good deal i think they should either do that or or or afford some time to the military or or helping elderly people i yes yes definitely i i'd you know i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home and that's true i'm not sure that that's not a bad idear and or the military for a year or two wouldn't be bad for i think it teaches kids how to grow how about yourself yeah uh i agree with you um um what i'm thinking about is back oh when i was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of you know the parents kind of pushed them to join like the Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts and they did do do do a lot of public service activities but these days they're not um parents parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that because when i was in the Girl Scouts we did a lot of public service things because that's just part of of of the scouting and you know yeah i've i that's really great i i really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent two excellent organizations they are but parents but you know they kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that and and they don't follow it at all you know there're very few scouts go on and become Eagle Scouts and and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals but yeah they do oh no i i a senior ah senior okay so there's not uh oh they're just not um once they get into junior high they just not done anymore yeah they they lose interest and then when they young young adults there's even less interest they're they're more for um-hum i guess uh not not yeah i mean me yeah you're absolutely right i think it's a really a good thing i i like to see me grab grab grab walk yeah of course there's you know third world countries that can use all kind of help yeah but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country too but i think we ought to start right here at home i'm you know yeah um i'm not i'm not so sure that overseas help helping overseas would be such a hot idea for some for uh a lot of young kids people no it it but uh since there is much that needs to be done here i think that yeah i think that we need to really address what we've done here and and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives a much broader outlook um-hum well it's been really good we talked about this for a few minutes and uh hopefully we'll have another good topic maybe another call someday but i i don't really have too much more to say on this topic i guess no uh i agree with you we i guess we both agree that it's a good thing that they should do sometime well you take care and and enjoy the day thank you ma'am bye-bye yeah okay you too you too bye-bye  okay yeah how many children do you have i have four and i have three what do you have boys girls i have uh three boys and one girl the girl's adopted i have uh-huh i have two girls and one boy yeah do you have grandchildren yet uh yeah i got two grandchildren oh i got ahead of you there i got three and one on the way no but uh i know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of time together yeah uh uh school activities and my my boy was in hockey yeah and of course the girls uh and and uh myself we rooted you know we didn't participate but we did a lot of family things together yeah we had animals for the children you know our horses and that kind of thing and uh school activities type stuff yeah yeah my kids were involved in sports uh-huh football and baseball and uh-huh whatever did you find the time to attend but uh oh yeah oh yeah we did too when they were growing up we did we were out in the middle of a desert out in Ridgecrest California i think that's kind of the key don't you huh i think that's kind of the key yeah is to not be in the big city yeah there wasn't a lot of other things for them to do right and uh so when when they participated in sports or whatever well uh all nearly all the parents went and yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country yeah i mean it's not as vast a country as like you know where you people are from because i lived in Abilene for a little while yeah and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there yeah you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles we came back when they were teenagers uh-huh and of course uh then they came to the big city as teenagers and that the time with them wasn't as much as it was when they were out there in the small yeah town out in the middle of the desert uh-huh but they at least they had the background yeah and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they don't get into as much trouble or seek to right you know do other things that are really not good for them you know yeah gosh our our kids were fortunate they had good good other kids to play with yep same here uh maybe it's not like it is nowadays really when there's so much uh some drugs and everything else no no i know i'm so happy that i had mine had mine when i did and that i'm not having them now i think about it yeah i would not want to raise a a child today no no from scratch you know from start and plus i think that the uh mothers the husbands and wives both having to work yeah it's not a matter of choice anymore i think most people no it's a necessity yeah it's a and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids yeah yeah i well uh of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day yeah you know and then uh my uh husband was with them at night yeah so they were always with a family member you know yeah and babysitters and uh day care and all that stuff kids don't really bond anymore yeah the mother's aren't there well i i i told my wife that uh i don't know what young kids just starting out nowadays especially if they have uh have some children if if they're trying to buy a house both of them have to work in order to pay for a house oh yeah yep uh and the kids really spend more time at school or with a babysitter then they do with their parents exactly but you know uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center and everything else is it really worth all that yep rather than to wait until the children are like in school yeah and then go for that type of goal i think that too many people want everything now yeah yeah i told like we had to save and plan and uh-huh do without and that kind of stuff where it's now the credit cards and yeah i mean they just go and buy it you know yeah well kids nowadays they want to start out with a exact three bedroom brick house yep and when we started out well we started out in first of all in an apartment and then rented a a duplex exactly sure and then went from a duplex to a little old two bedroom frame house that's my point and and i think that they should like learn how to crawl before they walk but uh uh-huh it's it's too much it and it's too accessible yeah and they get into it and they're over their heads i think that's why there's so many divorces too yeah because the money becomes uh an issue the children become an issue the jobs become an issue and it's like you know what's left yeah just to argue and that type of thing you know uh-huh i'm i'm i really feel for young parents nowadays i do i do i i just don't uh see how they're like between a rock and a hard spot yeah it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer yeah or mothers to children you know because they're able to spend some time yeah they brought that up at TI i don't know how many times to to uh have a day care at yeah for working mothers but uh TI never has seen fit to do it no huh but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do yeah i think that's great because i mean you know you you it's less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or yeah just know they're close by yeah you know it's it's very hard well it was nice chatting with you well do you work at a Attleboro or does your or your husband yes i do i do no i do oh you do yeah okay i work in uh building twelve in Attleboro oh well of course i always see see uh Attleboro mission on teen news and everything else but uh never been up there oh you should come it's it's a it's a nice place in the summertime though don't come in the winter yeah yeah i started to say what what's the temperature up there now right now we're in the thirties in the thirties and we're expecting a snowstorm tomorrow into Friday oh boy possibly Saturday oh me so it's supposed to be real bad driving tomorrow afternoon well we're supposed to get rain but no snow but we're we're in the sixties and seventies in the daytime oh that's terrible i'm jealous we no i it it's well this is the month where it's very unsettled because March is like between winter and spring out here it's like one minute you've got winter weather the next minute you have spring like weather everybody's got a cold yeah you don't know how to dress you know yeah so it's kind of tough and they say that the driving tomorrow is supposed to be really bad in the afternoon well the colds and the flu have been going around down here have they oh man i'm telling you everybody's and i think it's really the weather it will it will get warm one day and then not real cold but pretty cool the next day and then warm the next day yeah yeah and it's just uh plus there's been an awfully lot of uh uh mountain cedar and everything else in the air oh wow and it's really driving people with sinuses crazy and sure and sore throats and colds and whatever yeah yeah well uh i i can tell by your accent that you're a Texan and you know i miss hearing that they used to make fun of me because of being you know my accent yeah they they try to get me to say things because they they thought i talked so funny but you sound just like um the the children that i worked with up there the same type of voice yeah yeah i remember i remember when i was out at Ridgecrest somebody had a flat and uh i asked them i said do you have a tire tool in the in the trunk and he said a what and i said a tire tool he said you mean a T A R tool and i said no a T I R E tool yeah right like oil or oil that's true well listen it was nice speaking with you yeah nice talking to you Irene and you stay warm up there okay Jim okay take care bye-bye bye-bye  what would you do about this pressing problem well i can relate to uh when i decided to choose a college uh it really had very little to do with academics uh i i stayed at a i went to a local uh university that was close to home it's about sixty miles away went to the University of Wisconsin oh and uh besides it being uh close and being a uh major university in the big ten a prestigious conference i joined the marching band and uh that really was uh a good deal of the motivation for going to that uh college so with the band yeah something to do extracurricular activity what do you play i play the trumpet my uh my husband played music he was involved in music all of his life and went to Notre Dame where he decided he was going to have a good time and never and then never went into the scholastic bands he went into uh okay bands on campus and he played music but i i just can't believe that he didn't can play in a Notre Dame band when he was good enough to do it uh-huh he went the other route i think uh i think the advise i'd give to parents would be to start when they're like four years old today at least start saving yeah at least start saving and and start routing them to where at least they'll have a chance to get ahead well i think most people when they are in high school are very undecided about what course of study they want to take and they really don't have the foggiest idea of what kind of career they want to get into at least until at least until they've been in college for a couple of years yeah that's it's um i wish i had known more when i was uh choosing a college i i kind of did or i'd i went off to i grew up in California and i went off to the University of Utah and didn't find the atmosphere there what i quite expected so i came back and went to Cal State and so i kind of do what you did only by route of another school and uh-huh i wish i had known more about what a school meant yeah well i i started uh studying mathematics basically because i was really good at that in high school and uh by the time i was a sophomore i decided that mathematics was really not the thing to be into to find a good job they weren't hiring mathematicians at the time oh so i started taking computer science courses and uh that become my major course of study uh i finished a major in mathematics also i had a double major but uh computer science is what got me a job right and it was very uh very much in demand for a career well it still is uh still is that's true it's uh very good choice i was just looking at a job sheet that's about all that's in there um-hum so but i know many people who have changed majors several times in uh college uh in fact very few people finish in four years now do you think it do you think it's well worth going to uh uh bigger school or more well-known school uh i really don't think it makes that much difference what size of the school college or university one chooses as long as they have a decent program and they're uh uh well known throughout the country right right the reputation that they have a good reputation uh-huh um some of these i didn't the college i went to was a big school but i was an English major and it the English major is very small so i had the benefit of being able to talk to my professors and hangout with them you know and i really appreciated that yeah well that does make a difference uh Wisconsin had a very good reputation in uh computer science and engineering departments and i'm sure that helped uh helped me get job offers uh if you choose a school that's not well known or it does not have a very good curriculum in uh in the in those areas uh it could be difficult to uh make a career out of it right i think that's what i would tell parents kind of like uh going to SMU they have a reputation as being a party school and uh i just i have to question how worthwhile it is to go to a school that uh really isn't uh that well known for their academics hey i'm headed there i took a couple of semesters of graduate school there myself well they have the master of liberal arts there and so i thought i would go and do that right okay it's the closest thing to a humanities degree that they let you do at night uh-huh it's not the i i'm not into the Bohemian thing you know were i waitress during at night and go to school during the day yeah i was just making making a point that some schools develop certain reputations and no i i agree but but it's like oh you offer this degree okay i'll go uh-huh i've always wanted a masters degree but to get one in in English or anything other than an MBA it's really difficult to do at night yeah that that's true uh i i took uh like i said i took uh couple of semesters at SMU and it at SMU in uh engineering courses but uh it really did conflict too much with uh with my work it's very difficult uh to maintain a full-time job and try to take uh courses uh in off hours yeah right it's true so i quit doing that several years ago and and just lived the easy life well yeah somewhat i wouldn't mind going back to school again if i thought it i wasn't going to get in trouble again with the with the work it just takes too much time that's true going back full-time i think is is the way to go oh it it would be wonderful yeah if one can afford to do that that's back to the reason why why i joined the band that was my entertainment while i was in school i know the little dreams right going to all the football games and hockey and basketball games uh because when you're a poor starving student you don't have the uh cash flow to uh entertain yourself you have to find whatever means you can right that's true yeah those events were always free i i uh i picked up sweats for the track team i was the track track team manager we got i got to ride the bus all over the state i got to see everything that sounds exciting so it was fun it was little i did that for a long time it was a lot of fun so i understand that uh-huh i'd recommend that if if someone was trying to choose a college that they they get uh as much information on the schools as they can as far as what curriculums they offer and uh how reputable they are and what kind of reputation they have in the country and uh go from there the rest of it's just personal preference whether you like the mascot or not or whether it's close by yeah yeah that's true i mean uh Wisconsin was only up uh sixty mile bus ride away from my parents house so it only took an hour to get back on uh oh a couple weekends a semester it was very convenient not to mention being a public university it was the tuition was uh much less expensive yeah that was a good thing to look out for i looked into going to Marquette also and had a chance to get a scholarship there but it would have only covered uh about a quarter of the cost of the first uh year which uh wasn't enough of a motivation to uh to go there to commit to to four years well we're still writing checks for the loans for Notre Dame um-hum yeah i'm sure that that's uh it's not uh cheap either but he's really happy he went there well that's good i i got uh by with the minimal amount of financial aid and was able to pay it all off within two years of graduation wow so i was very pleased with that of course i lived like a pauper too during that time right i know a lot of people that did most couldn't afford to to go to a movie yeah it was uh really living on a budget forced you to learn a few things that's true yeah but we had fun tried to have fun being in the band was about the only entertainment i had uh i really i miss college i had a good time that was fun uh lived on Tombstone pizzas and Coca-Cola yeah it was fun well i'll just wrap this up okay now that we've done our conversation for tonight well wonder if if this advice was uh worth following for uh choosing a school hopefully i i guess i don't know what they're doing with the conversations they're being recorded and uh oh put in uh i guess in Washington DC somewhere for reference for speech projects aren't aren't they like put taking the words and and listening to the dialect and yeah yeah that is true based on where where you come from and all that's funny where you're educated in the first uh ten years i guess that would be interesting well it was good talking to you okay i appreciate it enjoyed it all right bye okay thanks a lot bye-bye  normally i listen to CNN or Headline News about an hour a day and then i supplement that with uh radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week do you and a newspaper if i have time yeah i don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and and try to catch one of the morning talk shows and then i usually end up flipping through CNN and Headline News during the evening i always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the the week's hot events so i try to i try to catch that if nothing else that's true and and how do you rate the uh how are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving for for local news i think we do real well where it's we live in a kind of small town but i think we get excellent local coverage um and i like the national news that we see we we watch NBC and i think they do a real good job so i'm i've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get how about you on the whole i'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves um since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite right uh i think i'm fed up with trite there seems to be more and more of it and i understand the void that uh comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations and as as expensive as they are to produce they certainly don't want any dead airspace uh-huh yeah but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us and like you said save the commentaries because i'm going to listen to the the news and draw my own opinions i don't really need their help to do that i i we're certainly in agreement there i don't think radio is as bad to do that as TV is uh radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done they're maybe they're a little more efficient um-hum or have more to do over that same time frame i don't know which that answer is right uh i think the my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like Sixty Minutes do you watch that i used to but i don't anymore maybe once or twice a year well i used to watch Sixty Minutes until they did two programs uh that i knew both the people and the incidences incidences uh-huh and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint really that was in my estimate nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings yes and it ever since that time i just don't watch uh so i guess we have the the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not yeah well i had heard a couple of people you know that i had talked to about certain programs say that you know they had read other things besides what Sixty Minutes presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the you know news articles or whatever they had they had already been familiar with so i started questioning just how how bias they really were so i don't know did i don't know how old you are but it seems to me like the last uh newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite hum so i don't i don't know if you're familiar with him or not no not really you know in the last few years just his kind of informal segments i've seen but i never got to see his actual nightly news i liked i i did grow up with David Brinkley well Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold uh uh-huh of Cronkite and he did a a pretty good job The Huntley Brinkley Report was quite excellent over the years yeah we we used to watch um him and i guess John Chancellor and i always liked David Brinkley and i and i used to enjoy John Chancellor's style of reporting but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that's where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries so well once they've reported the facts all they can offer is an opinion anymore right what did you think of the news coverage of the war well i almost felt like it was too much indeed i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day one in the morning and one in the evening um-hum uh i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst really and i don't need their fill-ins you know did that help you understand a lot what was going on your your prior experience with the military did yes but i i think it helps me everyday in trying to review what the state that the world is in and try to guess where we're going i wondered if it would help you sometimes fill-in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people people like myself might not pick up on well i i think uh my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with Sixty Minutes okay what weekly um magazine do you look at is it i like US News and World Report at one time or another i've taken them all for a year i believe in giving anything a chance uh-huh sure uh but i keep coming back to that one so i that's kind of my favorite does it give a pretty good overview of everything or like does it give um i guess little encapsulated reports and and then a few big stories it's primarily um a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports yeah uh here's what went on in Asia over the past week and there's maybe a page of that little brief paragraphs unless that was one of their the focus of their main stories that sounds good if you were short on time you could get a summary real quick uh it too is one those you know in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways and i do most of my reading in the bathroom right um and it's one of those that i can either read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there right and it just seems to fit nicely so that i can get it read in about three days well we're working on a Newsweek uh for the last couple of months we got you know an introductory sub scription so we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like Glamour or Sports Illustrated so we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us so to speak well to broaden your horizons make you think about different things anyway it can't hurt well anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt no i i even i enjoy reading T News i try to catch it because it's another example they just they just show you the words and the facts and they they don't offer any commentary and it gives me a quick chance to to be caught up during the day because you know we don't listen to the radio at work at all so i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything oh i'm with you i have to check T News every everyday it's my noontime dose of facts yeah and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is um Talking Fingers do you have that no you have different telephone numbers that you can dial and then you dial in an access code and it will depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update it will give you um updated information so it can give you you know current news updates current weather updates things like that and it's it's offered through the local phone company free of charge hum so that's an interesting alternative occasionally that i like to use well it does sound very interesting maybe our phone company out here will get around to offering something like that it it really is yeah it really is nice i mean because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk and find out about so that is something you might keep your eyes open for i think it's it's catching on throughout the country  okay okay so what do you think about it should um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing choice the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldn't take them in your own home then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived uh-huh too far away to care for them or your daily job or whatever prevented it right but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care yeah and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care uh-huh uh-huh you know where some people can't where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed and they can't get around but then they have full care but i really like those those options now and and i think about it more often because my husband's parents uh-huh are they're very active right now but they're seventy five and and seventy two so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age uh-huh yes um it's it's funny because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know i know someone that works works in all three different stages like you said uh-huh and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building they we call it um well we have high rises and it's just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away uh-huh and it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through uh-huh and it's it's really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing but it's it's really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because she's starting to get Alzheimer's disease uh-huh uh-huh and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing right and to actually sit so it's really nice to see that yeah that's some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like you're saying a good mix of people who have the same interests and uh and the programs here they have different uh-huh uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs they have several areas they have one area in town where the people i guess a lot of it comes with money it this this one area is a bit more expensive and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life but but things that people where they have similar interests uh-huh like you're saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to church there's a bus there yeah uh-huh and it'll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though it's you know maybe it's thirty minutes away because it's a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation that's that's something i'd look for something that would make me happy yeah personally if i had to live there because i don't think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really don't necessarily like it because they're not in their own home uh-huh yeah uh-huh so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um enjoyable for them that'd that'd be one thing i'd look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses uh-huh yeah um i'm in college and i'm i'm only twenty one but we had a speech i had a speech class last semester and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly uh-huh and i was so surprised to hear how many people like whenever they're in you know the older people they're like um fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because they you know they wander the halls uh-huh and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine and so many of them you know are yeah are overmedicated too yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through And i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything uh-huh yeah that's one of the things that that we don't think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires to uh be in one of these places because some of these people that are just on social security and if they don't have any living relatives perhaps they never had children or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are uh-huh you know that that are not good where they they have very minimum minimal care and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it yeah are probably are paid at a minimum wage and they just do they don't care as much and and like you said they're trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves yeah to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because you've got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in fee uh-huh i know and some and sometimes they share a room and it's just a little cubbyhole and they share it with another person and they're still paying that much it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous yeah oh yeah so you've yeah you've got to really strike a balance in what kind of care what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time uh-huh uh-huh yeah um i've been lucky well my mom's um parents they're both in their in their uh eighties and i was just home for spring break and my grandma said something to me about she goes well maybe we'll just sell the house she said it's getting too big for us to take care of and i was like no no no stay in the house as long as you can well like there are other communities too that aren't necessarily a nursing home i had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that um was in a it was a it was a housing division each person had their own little bitty house that they had built and it was um uh-huh supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government but it was this little bitty one bedroom house but it was a separate house and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom oh so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised them all these houses were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block and they had a a supervisory um uh-huh wasn't a house really it was it was more like a it sounds like uh an apartment or some a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ri ng and and someone could come to their house oh yeah and that and they always cooked then they had they had the choice you know they lived in their own little house they had their own possessions still in there to some extent you know some of them uh-huh uh-huh and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner and they always had somebody come in for lunch but they had people who did you know they didn't have to mess with the yard they had people who did the yard and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybody's house so they didn't have to worry about that and it was really a nice uh-huh oh yeah it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didn't uh-huh oh really yeah see now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were well i've lived here for thirty years and we've built this and this is our home and we have nothing else to show for our lives and we don't want to leave uh we've run into a lot of that yeah oh yeah yeah it would be hard to that's that's why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff um yeah and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so it's probably not widely available uh-huh yeah that's what like well um now i know we have an old we call it an old folks home but it's basically a nursing home too but everyone has basically their own room yeah and they're allow you know they none of them have cars because they can't drive uh-huh but if someone would come to get them you know they're allowed to leave with them and there's a staff there that makes supper for them and each person has a chore like maybe Wednesday night it's George's turn to set all the tables huh and it's really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around and i know um our youth group goes over and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that yeah well that's good everybody needs some sense of responsibility uh-huh yeah just to keep them going an even even if it's just a little bit yeah uh-huh so it's it's more like living with a big in a big house where it's your turn to to set the table like you're saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice yeah uh-huh but i think before i like you i don't think you i don't think it's right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it yes unless they're at a point where they're mentally incapacitated well yeah say like you're saying with Alzheimer's and going to be the people who have to be there uh-huh that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it when you're when you're in something like that that they'll get the kind of medical care they want without or uh-huh overdoing it uh-huh yeah so uh-huh  okay so who's your uh favorite team who do you think the Dallas Cowboys the Dallas Cowgirls huh yeah well they did have a fairly decent year finally this year um-hum at least they're coming around yeah they're going to get better i mean you know well i mean you know i think uh once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established uh they'll do all right yeah as long as Troy Aikman doesn't get hurt again that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year um-hum so i don't i don't even know who your favorite team is actually i'm a Viking fan okay i think i did know that i just forgot okay and they haven't been doing too hot so yeah has Herschel Walker done much for them no in fact in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal definitely well he was a good player i guess i don't know he just never i don't know for a while there he just i've never been over impressed with him well he could always get past you know he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone but um i guess you never could really see him play because with the Cowboys while he was with the team the rest of the team was pretty poor so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team and i always just assumed he was too good for the rest of the team but i don't know well who's the running back is it Sammy Smith or is it Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith Emmitt Smith yeah he's been doing real good i'm pretty impressed with him so far did he did he actually play in the Pro Bowl i remember he was like a backup and then somebody got injured and he was supposed to go yeah i'm not sure yeah i kind of i haven't been keeping up with football i mean in the fall i i can go on and on about football but since it's kind of off season it's kind of hard to think back about all that but uh uh who else is uh uh there's you know Mike Lynn from the Minnesota Vikings he used to be the general manager starting the World Football League yeah some uh and that and he was trying to keep uh uh uh i can't even think of the guy's name either the coach of the Vikings um i have no idea Burt Jerry Burns no earthly idea going to keep he was going to keep him as the coach somehow but uh i don't know i'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow how did they end up this year did they did they make it to the play-offs at all well they started out really bad they went like one and six and then they won five or six in a row um um-hum so they were in a shot to make the play-offs and they screwed up the last couple of games kind of like the Cowboys huh yep i guess you can except i think the Cowboys are on the upswing i don't know about the Vikings yeah just hadn't heard much about them lately and the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowboys in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys and the Cowboy Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys so yeah well the Cardinals i don't know i think the Cowboys probably have a a better team they just at the end of the season the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt because uh Laufenberg just couldn't never really get it together at all of course he sat along the sidelines all season he never really got in a game never did a whole lot oh don't make any excuses for him well i'm just saying i shouldn't i shouldn't blast him like that say oh well Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them i mean he didn't get to see much action but it's too bad because now now you know he had a shot and and didn't look too good and so no one is going to have much faith in him any more um-hum in fact i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback i haven't uh i haven't kept up with it lately but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on or or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of but i heard on the radio this morning or yesterday morning that uh Aikman's back in practicing doing real real well um who is it Michael Irvin uh-huh he said that uh Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time so sounds like he's going to be all right for next season they're just trying not to overwork him right now until he gets his shoulder uh back in shape it was his shoulder wasn't it that he had problems with i don't know yeah think it was i think it i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on but anyway they're trying to keep him you know keep him uh from reinjuring anything but anyway but uh well i got my uh thirty day notice yesterday thirty day notice for what um i'm done where i work oh really so anyway i guess we can't talk much more about that but i just thought i'd throw that in there what oh okay maybe i'll call you back after after the recording is finished actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes i i can't remember oh we i've always ran out of time ever since i've done this really i usually have too they always say you've talked your ten minute limit yeah i've done that once or twice i didn't look at the clock when we started talking so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in make sure we get our cash flow yeah so other than the Vikings who do you like um actually when i was younger i was a Cardinal fan too remember Jim Hart uh oh Jim Hart was playing Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals this was a long time ago yeah uh i don't know who else i've ever that's about it i was always a Viking fan i think i was into the Cardinals for a little bit um-hum back when they were in Saint Louis and and yeah oh of course since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been uh all that impressive i guess i guess i've always been a Cowboy fan other than that i mean you know when i've you know when you grow up in a city that has the you know one of the greatest football teams until the last few years you kin d of tend to yeah well the Cowboys were America's football team there's no question about that so get caught up in it yeah yeah i mean it it was really exciting growing up when when the Cowboys were really big because my parents would always have season tickets and they'd go to all the games and you know the hype were just unbelievable it's just you know the last oh i guess probably since about eighty four about eighty five was when they started kind of going downhill really but you know i'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys Cowboys Cowboys and you know Super Bowl and all this other stuff so i can't you know i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years i mean i think they'll pull out of it and you know they'll they'll wind up being good again they've got some lot of really good young players that are going to that are going to uh do pretty good i think but they're raising prices on their tickets so they're banking on doing good next season again what are they going up to thirty bucks or something i think tickets are yeah thirty or thirty two for really good tickets see they they sectioned it out even more they used to just have like uh first of all it was all one price and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else and now they're sectioning it off to like from the from one twenty yard line to the other one just on the lower levels is the highest price and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end the direct end zones but um they have about four or five different prices now that they're structuring it with but obviously yeah they're all going up even more or less is what it's going to do so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year um you know i'm not sure i'm not positive i didn't i didn't really think about that i just remember trying to figure out where you could get that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper but not that i'll ever go i hadn't been to a Cowboys game last time last time i went to the Cowboys game was during that um NFL strike or the when they had the scab team teams in there and it was the uh Dallas and Washington Redskins game and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets because a lot of those doctors have season tickets and they um if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else so my dad i went with my dad to a game that one time but that wasn't a real you know it was it was the scab teams it was kind of you know it was kind of different i guess and before that it's been quite a few years i've been wanting to go to a game i just never never have gotten around to it so maybe this year Texans cheap cheaper i guess that's interesting i almost lost our electricity here  hello hello did i reach the Dallas area hello you sure did to to whom am i speaking yeah that's what my name is Fernando hi Fernando i'm Bill hey how's it going do you work for TP yeah yeah where you calling from North Carolina State University oh for goodness sakes that's great great you a student there yep how what do you do i'm getting a Master's in computer science and computer engineering uh that's great how did you get introduced to this program um i took a voice IO course oh okay i just saw there was an advertisement within TI to sign up for it and i just i just uh signed up for it well uh one of my teachers went to a to this conference up in Bethesda Maryland um-hum and so he saw it there and he just said you guys want to make some money and talk five minutes a day here you go so yeah yeah uh uh Fernando uh uh Fernando are you from excuse me you from the North Carolina area uh not originally oh where are you from originally Argentina Argentina oh my goodness how do you like North Carolina yeah uh well i used to live up in New York and Maryland and i uh i like i like bigger cities i like i like more populated areas because i used to live in Buenos Aires but they have ten million people uh-huh yeah but uh this area is nice it looks like it's got a lot of uh job opportunities especially at Research Triangle Park yeah yeah and so it looks it looks well it's the third largest growing area in the country for businesses yeah i like the pine trees yeah yeah yeah i've i've been over there from time to time uh you're you're at the University of North Carolina no North Carolina State oh oh North okay NC State the wildcats yeah no the Wolf Pack no Wolf Pack okay the Wolf yeah no we're we're not we're not the Tar Heels yeah i knew you weren't the Tar Heels uh no somebody gave me a pair of running shorts and with the logo on it and i thought it was a wildcat but it was a wolf yeah for the N C State uh Wolf Pack why why do you run yeah i'm a runner oh okay my dad is too in fact i went up there visiting i had a friend at Davidson one time and i went up there visiting him and and he took me out running through the trails in the piney woods up there and i just loved it yeah yeah it's nice so well what are we supposed to i i was kind of fumbling this was the first i haven't been home other nights when they've called so this is the first time i've participated yeah and uh uh and i i was fumbling for my uh pin number uh when she was talking about what to talk about and what are we supposed to discuss it's it's clothing yeah uh how you dress to go to work or something like that right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season oh and from day to day okay well i'm ready any time you are sir okay okay ready i'm going to press the one hey uh how does this work Fernando do we talk for five minutes and does somebody cut us off or no then then we say bye and uh i i probably uh how do we know how do we know when the time's up well i i got a stopwatch here oh okay so i'll probably say you know it's like well we've been talking for five six minutes so okay okay you want to go first or me well uh we'll just open it okay i'll press the one ready okay ready one okay okay so well you see since i don't work i just go you know to class it all depends because i like to wear like sweat pants yeah because it's more comfortable for me but you know it's like when you're in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans yeah uh you know i i i can remember back to my college days and uh it was uh T-shirts and jeans in the warm weather and jackets and jeans in the short weather uh the thing is here i'm i'm supposed to be an executive you you can uh uh take that or or not depends on where you're looking from yeah and however and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties well many do but i am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie yeah i carry one in my briefcase and i wear it i wear it when the occasion demands if somebody important is coming to visit well i take it out and put it on uh i wear a sport jacket sometimes and i wear uh well reasonably not not real dressy dressy pants but but reasonably decent reasonably decent pants yeah and uh comfortable comfortable that way and a good loose fitting pair of shoes that i take off under tables when i'm in a conference room because i can't stand having anything on my feet and uh say i like my shirt and short i wear short sleeved shirts all year round i just okay are they like T-shirts or are they like do they have yeah yeah no short sleeved sort of semi dress shirt oh okay but i i i absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows and when i'm working and and i mean that's even in the winter time well because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it well we'll have a day or two that it'll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before Christmas but at uh uh normally it'll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and we've experienced some seventies here uh to eighties recently yeah yeah that's but i i don't ever feel the need to dress that warmly i i don't have to travel that far to work uh what what what what about uh your clothes in the winter time up there well it's basically you know it's like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T-shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it and then you know you'd but what happens is uh what i've seen here on campus it's very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere um-hum my goodness i i've not see that at all okay and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and b lack turtlenecks or white turtlenecks um-hum yeah and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans yeah but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody wears jeans and if not what the what the thing is that they're wear ing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it which is okay that that sounds pretty good uh it sounds like it's a very relaxed atmosphere on campus you know i've uh i've uh always TI is a very informal company uh i i think the thing that i've noticed in more recent years there's more ties and jackets and shirts as the younger the younger crowd seems to want to dress those of us i've been here thirty two years those of us been here for a long time don't care to dress up but when we came to work i was told that the president of the company set the standard of dress and he's he dressed like the janitor so we all we all did and the feeling has always been that without the shirts and ties and suit coats that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere and you could have a freer exchange of information yeah and i've seen this actually i spent seven years overseas with TI and while i was gone where at where at uh Malaysia four years in Malaysia and three years in the Philippines oh okay and and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in TI for the first time yeah what was interesting Malaysia is a tropical country just uh two degrees above the equator yeah and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them i absolutely never wore anything out in the tropics like a necktie but the thing is when you started with TI was it as big a company as it is now oh no no uh i think it was something i started in nineteen fifty nine we're talking about at the most eight to nine thousand people world wide and at that time the whole world was right here in Dallas as far as TI was concerned yeah yeah which is which is basic i mean when hello uh is that uh i'm sorry that's you probably got wait calling yeah i got a wait call hang on a second okay well i guess i'm supposed to talk alone while he's on the wait call about clothing right so i don't know what to say i don't wear any clothing we're at nudist camp we don't wear any clothes here you still there Fernando sorry uh yeah oh that's okay and anyway uh where uh oh we're talking about the size of the company yeah it was uh about eight or nine thousand people when i got here it has in the past gotten up to eighty six thousand we're not we're that high right now yeah but uh in in many many many many countries or was that in the seventies uh no i started in nineteen fifty nine i no no but uh when it it had gone up oh yeah yeah yeah it peaked out in the seventies yes yeah i've i've i've got thirty two years in yeah yeah i remember i i quit i sort of remember that i'm only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know TI was even making uh those little watches you know those those uh LED watches that you couldn't see in the sun okay right right right we made those yeah yeah yeah i used to referee soccer games and uh uh i would use those watches to time the games and i'd be out on the field middle of the field at high noon yeah and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see what time it was and uh yeah we were about the first ones to make those and went out of that business in nineteen eighty one so yeah uh back to uh uh back to clothes i don't really i don't really have what you'd you'd think was an expensive wardrobe i mean some people are very very very clothes conscious uh well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me huh um-hum um-hum yeah i wouldn't i i would think they'd spend at least that as the at the cost of clothes yeah i mean women go all i mean what i've seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me it's like people know how i dress and we we have you know like the gym here yeah they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one yeah yeah and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in yeah um-hum so i mean you don't feel as bad because it's like they they give you different year sometimes you know so you're wearing you know sometimes you're wearing eighty nine the other times sometimes you're wearing ninety one the other times you're wearing you know eighty six so it's okay you know is that for like gym classes for PE classes and things like that right see when we take PE you have to dress in the in PE clothes but it is it's issued to any one that wants one that's in the university yeah yeah right right right how many hours are you taking well right now since i'm graduating i'm only  hello hello there did i reach the Dallas area i beg your pardon did i reach the Dallas area nope you've reached Dayton Ohio Dayton Ohio i'm from North Carolina oh you're from North Carolina where in North Carolina in Raleigh Raleigh great my name's Mary yeah so my name is Fernando Fernando glad to know you so um do you work how'd you find out about this uh i was visiting my son down in Dallas oh okay he works for TI and uh no no but his wife has a contract with TI and that's how we learned about it um-hum oh okay because i'm down at NC State yeah um-hum and so i took a class and he said sign up and get some money and just talk for five minutes right so are you ready i'm ready okay let's get started all right okay okay so uh what do you think uh that uh what what what what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America oh if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person yeah but what what what are the steps well you have to see i a as the way i look at it you have to think first of all why or has has crime increased and if so why has crime increased well see the problem is is that um what happens is as that you're uh you know as you go from the country to a city crime always increases right because in the country people still respect uh the property of other people um-hum right and so as as and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city um-hum now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities and they wish to get the same thing they say why can't we have the same things that these other people have and the thing that we can do is we need money for drugs and what we have to do is we have to go there get some stuff steal it and then you know resell it it's easy you said the magic word there drugs which one yeah and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased that's uh that's uh the main reason i think uh everywhere because uh you have deaths i mean i mean you have murders and you have you know people stealing other people's stuff and that's a lot of it has to do with drugs oh yes it doesn't have to do i mean the thing is is that you know it's like you might be standing somewhere right and like let's say you're you you go you know you're driving out and you're driving back home and it's late at night and you stop by one of these you know twenty four hour you know gas stations joints yeah and uh somebody walks in there with a gun i mean they're going to want the money and you can tell by the people who are always caught that these people are there to get money for drugs i mean they don't want the money so uh so they can do something else with it now they don't want the money for food that's for sure right right and so well but you know the the strange thing uh perhaps not strange but something that many people don't realize is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty one and fifty two and find that there were drug dealers um-hum at that time trying to influence the high school kids because uh i'm a retired educator okay and uh in fifty one and fifty two the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs how to recognize the pushers outside the one entrance that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started and so on and so on yeah so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years and we're just really uh uh now trying to uh figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge yeah there's a there's a a song that i know which says you know that it's like in uh nineteen eighty eight nineteen eighty nine the local state and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America hm and uh i their figures i think are true so i mean it's like compared to you know compared to weapons and stuff like that i mean you're spending nothing on on crime in the country itself what you're doing is you you know it's like you have other things you know it's like you have the AIDS we're going to solve try to solve the AIDS problem while while you know some people are getting killed here and there and then uh-huh you know the uh another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers the big dealers in drugs may be may be part of the power structure that's keeping us from spending the money in that direction uh-huh but those people never get caught the people that that's right they'll never get caught that that i see their theory is that if i'm surrounded and i'm going to be caught i'm going to try to pry my way through and they're not going to take me alive um-hum but i have such a big army outside of my place that nobody can touch me that's right but they'll you know it's like of course i mean i might be you know the the leading drug dealer here but you won't find me dealing in drugs i mean there's no connection between me and the people that you caught you know that's right that's right then one person doesn't know the other person down the line right but the guy at the very top the one who's who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure uh the uh and had the political uh pull to keep things from uh keep the interest or the uh emphasis in some other direction other than on the drug dealing because it sure is monstrous in this country yeah yeah i was i was at a at a party on Saturday and this guy comes up he goes hey how you doing whatever and then he started talking to me and this guy was from Jamaica right and he's got his little brother selling drugs um-hum um-hum you know and he goes yeah i just came up here to work and i go oh you did i bet you make uh very good money up here he goes yeah i make a lot a lot of money he goes you know and uh in the movie Good Fellas yeah right did you see it nope i only heard about it okay in one part the guy goes out of jail and within uh two months he had all his house payments done everything paid and you know and he had enough money to you know it's like um-hum those guys at one point you know they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it yeah well you know even in our prison systems they're finding that they're they're having drugs smuggled into them yeah yeah that's that that was also in the movie yeah right so hello Mary it's been nice talking we've been talking for five minutes it was i beg your we've been talking for a little bit i appreciate the call i enjoyed talking with you all right okay same here bye-bye uh-huh bye-bye  okay okay well what are we doing about recycling in our community well well in our area we just introduced the um citywide uh Clean King Sport campaign and we have a recycling mascot called Kleanaroo he's a kangaroo and um we're setting up curbside recycling bins for the city home owners and several of our local businesses also have recycling stations set up in their parking lots um-hum and how about in your area well in our i live in a very small community outside of the Dallas area and uh we're just getting started as a matter of fact this last week we got a notice in the mail from City Hall and they've informed us that uh we'd be getting more instructions in the mail in a week or two but we're going to start a separation of our refuse and separating the cans from the paper et cetera um-hum and apart of that we haven't really done much of anything except for uh separating your newspapers and taking those to uh an area that they've designated um but in uh in the office place we've been doing it for some time separating our uh uh computer paper from our normal garbage all right so have we we've been doing the computer paper and then we've also been doing our aluminum cans uh-huh what do they do with the cans i that's the one thing i don't know i i don't know if they take them to the local aluminum uh recycling plant um-hum uh just locally or or what i assume that's what they would do i would assume so and then maybe do something with the money for charity or something i would hope yeah i i think that's what they do i think they they give that to charity i yeah that's a good idea and and uh other than the work place and here at home um i don't know too much is going on in the community i know that in Plano it's a larger city in the area they they uh i believe about a month or two ago they started having the citizens separate their refuse okay and they've even um got a particular huge uh waste can that they have to use oh for each different product oh okay right uh-huh that makes it kind of easier then you remember you know yeah i i was going to say i've seen in some of these um local mail order catalogs they've got trash can dividers for for home owners who don't have those it it um-hum oh uh-huh it like cuts your trash can in half so you could put cans on one side and and other on the other side so other side that's a good idea i think i think a lot of people are jumping on the band wagon um-hum um as far as you know should more be done i think there's i think there's always more that can be done i think as we all get in the swing of things this is just a beginning don't you think yes i've even heard them talking about uh recycling Freon from refrigerators refrigeration systems yes there are people there are companies that recycle their Freon oh really um-hum and um i'm sure there are a lot chemicals that that can be recycled that yeah i know the motor oil there's a lot of um-hum we have places that we can take our motor oil to if you change your own oil at home i now that's we we don't have that that's neat um KMart does that some of the KMarts in the area where i don't have any except for the lawn motor lawn mower oh uh-huh um machine oil because i always have my oil changed out of the house but but but you'd think that uh garages could do that yes i'm sure they do uh i mean that would be great um-hum because that's something that doesn't go back into the soil does it doesn't break down no it's it's really bad to not break down um-hum i uh saw an article the other day in Ann Landers that talked about how long it takes like a cigarette butt to decompose and i think it was between twenty and thirty years is that right i had no idea yes i i was i was flabbergasted and i think plastic was um plastic never totally total breaks down never breaks down um the Styrofoam that's the one that never did yep yeah never did some plastic took fifty years fifty years yeah um i know that i had heard that uh McDonald's has gotten so much flack about sending their hot foods out in the Styrofoam that they are going to work on something they they have here yes i used to get my Egg McMuffin in one of those little Styrofoam cup uh cups like and now they wrap them in paper other than that oh have they um-hum do they well good yes so i was really glad to see that i think they're one of the businesses at large that do things like that they're more aware of it they they are good or at least they try and do something about it first i think they recognize their their position as a community leader um-hum and really work to keep that going i think you're right so and and the only other thing i've seen has been the setting up a compost heap in your own backyard um-hum but that's that's hard if you don't have a big yard or if you live in an apartment defiantly if you live in an apartment right that might not go over real well right that's for sure so well let's see has it been i think have we been our five minutes uh i really don't know i haven't been timing it but i think i know the last time i did this they came on and said you you have exceeded your ten minutes time limit hang up within the next thirty seconds so oh okay oh all right um well i guess we'll just say good-bye then okay and and i think we just hang up i don't think we have to do anything else okay but it's been very nice talking to you okay thank you nice to talk to you also all righty bye-bye bye-bye  nope first one i've had from California and where are you uh North Carolina uh-huh well i guess the only people i've talked to before were from Texas so i yeah mine me too and i had i was beginning to think that was the only people on the network yeah they all work for TI too well what do you uh what are your favorite television shows well first and foremost it's got to be LA Law LA Law yeah that's a very popular one around my office but i've never seen it yeah never never have seen it my goodness it's hard to believe i didn't think there was anybody in the country who hadn't seen that one i well i can go even better than that i've never seen Dallas either never never once gosh i admit that i used to be hooked on Dallas but back way long time ago when Jock died i gave up watching it it just got too funny well i think i just sort of uh didn't start watching it and then felt like i would have been way too late getting in on the action to figure out what was going on so i never did get involved in it well i think the writers had the same problem um-hum yeah i mean they they went for an entire season with this and i'm sure you heard about it all these things oh who killed JR all these things going on no this was i think it was before or after that oh but they went for this whole season and they had all these situations and then to end the season come to find out Pam it was all a dream oh yes yes i remember reading about that thinking uh i would have just strangled them you remember that i mean an and then oh i i tell you that just did it for me right there i said you've put me through an entire season of Pam dreaming yes you know you writers are coming you know you're having a hard time here i think that's right i think they just lost their uh inspiration for a while well i understand that this is the last season for it yeah somebody said that uh JR is going to die and that will be end of the season forever i mean the end of the show forever uh i i read something in the paper yeah that's yeah they uh i read something in the paper today talking about or it was Parade magazine yesterday and they said you know when's the last episode and what's going to happen and they say insiders say JR is going to get knocked off well it's about time huh good about time too bad they didn't kill him the first time yeah too bad they didn't get away with it shoot um-hum well anyway what's your favorites oh well i mostly watch public television so yeah i'm one of those i uh no i i that's what i spend most of my time watching that uh well i love Masterpiece Theatre oh yeah and i love the mystery series yeah mystery especially uh Miss Marple oh yes oh i i've i've got all the videos that i can get my hands on of of Miss Marple oh yeah i love those i used to i i lived in England for about four years so it really brings back oh we uh-huh some memories we have uh uh a local station uh on our cable network here that uh is showing all the Miss Marples over again so we got to repeat them it must be either uh A&E or um uh Discovery Discovery i i think it is A&E yeah A&E runs quite a lot of them um i like Discovery Channel too i like they have lots of wildlife shows and um-hum oh they do have some absolutely gorgeous things so uh but they uh the one we just watched that we had videotaped from the weekend was the Gardens of the World did you see that one this week yeah hum-um no i missed it uh well nice i bet we are lucky enough to now be on a cable system that has four public TV channels um boy that is that is good so we get we get things over and over so if we miss them we can catch them later and that Gardens of the Worlds was absolutely glorious it was i bet it was uh Audrey Hepburn was narrating it um i like her and they took you all over uh oh i like that started in Italy went to England France some in America uh also Japan anyway it was a really a a visual treat um really nice i bet i bet yeah the interesting thing about public TV is it's not public around here you have to have cable to get it is that right um-hum uh well uh silly when i was in Houston there was one station of just uh it was uh the University of Houston station um-hum and uh so it had not all of the stuff that people in other parts of the country were getting because each station gets its own mix um-hum but when i moved to California and all of a sudden i had this uh surfeit of public television um-hum yeah we can get all sorts of things everything from i guess on Saturday there you can watch something like eight different cooking shows um-hum so i don't but i could if i felt like it right yeah i i spend a lot of time down in Charlotte uh and on their just the the regular TV not cable you can pick up four PB or three PBS channels um-hum but uh the closest one to Raleigh is in uh Chapel Hill which is about twenty five miles away and believe it or not you can't pick it up really i would have thought that was close enough that yeah it was it should be close enough but i guess they have the antennas pointing it the other way or something or you got a hill between you or something like that bu t yeah it's uh it just you can barely see the picture and you can't hear anything so well the only about the only things i watch on commercial television are Thirty Something and Twin Peaks uh and i just discovered that they uh have have canceled both of those so oh really yeah i've i've never seen either one of them well let me tell you that Twin Peaks was much better when it just started so maybe it's time for it to quit i they've gone downhill too oh well i guess there were i guess it was pretty popular because there was quite a lot of Twin Peak conversation well the thing i liked about it was that it was so unconventional that you couldn't predict what was coming next well at least that that's what i like about a show if if you can predict it it's not worth watching that's right and this one had all sorts of weird little things and would go off in uh strange directions and it had lots of uh little subtle touches that if you weren't watching you would miss uh that they'd have references to literature and things like that and they'd also just have odd thing they walk into a bank vault and there is a deer head lying on the table in the bank vault um and there's no explanation for it they treat it as perfectly normal and somebody says what's the deer head doing here and they said oh it fell off the wall so why was it doing on the wall and in one case the fellow was making coffee and they said there's a fish in the coffee pot well i suspect that that's a reference to Thoreau's Fish in the Bucket of Milk but i don't know for sure and i'm not sure what the relevance would be if it were but sounds like a pretty good show i'm sorry sorry i missed anyway it had a lot of things like that thing to make you keep watching just for the novelty and the surprise of it sorry i missed that one you know i i don't watch very much TV i i watch um LA Law um-hum and i watch Sixty Minutes um-hum and America's Funniest Home Videos um and that's about it well they and i watch the i sometimes watch the the news yeah i'd say probably what i watch the most faithfully is the news which i really don't watch as much as i just listen to it yeah back well when i had cable i used to just keep it on CNN not to watch it but just to have it in the background because i'd always listen to it when i'm fixing dinner or something like that it's i uh at least know if there's anything i want to read thoroughly in the newspaper um-hum i get the headlines off the television right yeah the uh cable prices are just too high nowadays and i'm not going to i i just won't pay that that kind of money for for what i'm getting i mean i miss A&E and i miss Discovery and i miss CNN but that's it yeah um-hum uh and it just it just wasn't worth it just to get those three uh we just about had to get it because the reception in our particular locality was so poor um-hum that we could only get about three stations and uh only one was a public station and we had a yeah San Francisco station and a San Jose station but neither one of them was very clear they were both um-hum barely adequate yeah well so we decided when the cable came through that we would get on it just so we could see what we were watching if we watched anything at all right yeah i'd i'd probably i'd probably get cable but i've got we got the the three networks and two local stations and that fulfills my needs because i don't watch TV that much anyway anymore anyway um-hum yeah i think i would be inclined to do the same thing if we could see anything without the cable yeah yeah i know what you mean course like i say the only thing i do miss is PBS because i there several things on there i like Masterpiece Theatre Mystery uh-huh especially those yeah uh Masterpiece Theatre is really good they have had some absolutely wonderful shows and they do they have incredibly good what are called production values they have yeah and and you yeah really well researched uh locations and sets and costumes and so forth and as far as i can tell on places where i have some knowledge their historical research is excellent um-hum yeah  okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute well credit cards boy that's an easy topic isn't it okay okay is it yes it is it's one we all hold dear and near i'm sure oh yes yes i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them yeah most of mine's been pretty good although i'm i guess i'm like a lot of other people now i'm trying to to pay off my credit cards and i've done pretty good at it uh-huh well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want you now not need want yeah uh-huh there is a big difference there's a big difference there yeah yeah but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them i've been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas it's too easy to to run into the gas station uh-huh oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least that's for me yeah what you uh-huh yeah yeah yeah so but yeah i've i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet not bad you know i just i'm just shocked at the end of the month yeah well to see what damage i have did but yeah yeah i try to keep it pretty reasonable well i've been pretty lucky in that respect i don't charge like i say i've i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies uh-huh so but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards there's you know they have uh wonderful features they're there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever yeah huh and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest it's like paying twice yeah they talk talks with that's true that's true yes so but i try to i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest oh uh-huh yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don't have an annual fee there and that helps yeah yeah oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now we're just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in yeah uh-huh yeah that's one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i'll just pay on it this month and yeah pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time yeah takes a long time that's right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that's you know it sure does uh-huh of course it's been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so but yeah uh-huh so yeah well i've enjoyed talking to you well i've enjoyed talking to you and maybe we'll get to talk again okay bye-bye okay bye-bye  well oh our topic is capital punishment i guess uh one thing is to compare uh how it is maybe here in Texas versus uh in Rhode Island maybe your part of the country yeah i you know i'm not sure if we have the death penalty here to be perfectly honest with you hold on a second do we have the death penalty in Rhode Island no okay no we don't but you know um yeah i i have some feelings about it in the sense that i feel if a person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and it's a really heinous crime i feel like the Bible says an eye for an eye um-hum describing a heinous crime being like murder or yeah you know something really a serial killer or what other ones would be you know someone who who really has no remorse you know that that just does these things uh i don't know without feeling guilty about it at all you know and the and their we in fact we have an example going on right now with this uh school teacher involved some teenagers uh-huh into uh committing murder get getting rid of her husband um i don't know if you're familiar with it Pamela Smart in New Hampshire don't think i've heard of that one see now in a situation like that the boys are only sixteen years old and they were sexually involved with her and i think like at that particular point she was twenty three you know so she wasn't really that much older than them and being a boy at that age i think that they're very um you know let's face it that's at a point in your life when you you're just starting to realize all the things of life yeah i think she probably had a lot of influence on them and they probably would have never done something like that if it wasn't for the crime of passion type of thing yeah we had one uh course in Texas they uh used to string them up now they and uh-huh got more uh civilized and uh give them lethal injection so we definitely do have uh capital punishment yeah now see i agree with that i i don't think a person should be electrocuted or hung or you know in in other words i believe that they should be punished and done away with on one hand like i say if they're if they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt but if there's the the other the other hand where you say you know if there's just that slim chance that they didn't do it and then you know spend the time say life imprisonment then at least they have a chance to over the years be proven not guilty yeah you know there was one here recently that comes to mind that's about a woman that uh this is ridiculous i mean it's almost uh it'd be funny if it wasn't so so sad i mean this woman this woman went out and hired somebody to uh yeah to uh kill another mother oh that's the cheerleader thing yeah right have you heard about that one oh yes that was on TV here yeah isn't that something it made national um i didn't know it made the national news yeah really that was something wasn't it uh it's unbelievable this but you know i i i saw i can't figure out what people are doing any more i mean it's getting so bad and i don't think unless that the crime that the laws get to the point where people are afraid to do something because they know they'll be punished you know what i'm saying well that brings up i guess part of what would be a question is uh you know is i guess you feel like that's a deterrent in uh capital punishment should be yeah and you know and i i don't know if it would be but i mean we don't know that it wouldn't either well it uh must be i think it's a matter of degree and uh of course uh course it varies from case to case or individual yeah and the other point someone made at one one time was that if someone is guilty of a terrible crime or they're a serial killer or mass murderer that if they're in prison that gives you the chance to um get into the person's mind to find out uh what led them to the point that they were at when they committed the crime to uh try to understand how their mind worked to prevent uh you know another person from getting into the same situation yeah but i don't know you know maybe you could do that for a certain period of time but i mean how long does that kind of a thing take you know to to um say to question the person or to get into their head yeah you know even if it took five years i think that if at that time you you feel that they were guilty or that they were uh of sound mind where they knew what crimes they were committing i mean people know what they're doing huh you know that that i really do i believe that that capital punishment should be there the prisons are overcrowded it costs the taxpayers a lot of money that's one thing down here we certainly have a problem with overcrowded prisons yeah i'll tell you in the state of Rhode Island it was so bad that the intake center that they have to house the the criminals before they go to the uh penitentiaries and stuff um were overcrowded and the judge fined the state thousands of dollars a day um to build a bigger intake center yeah so i mean it it's like where does this all stop well they're releasing them uh early here exactly same thing here and that's that's what they did and and then uh then you hear about ones that are on early release going out and yep committing a in fact the news tonight they had uh someone come on a seventy three year old man they they had gotten into a housing for the elderly and and the person who perpetrated the crime went in with someone who had a relative there and uh apparently this this person was on drugs and the old man was an invalid and he was in an elevator and he died for twelve dollars um well i tell you what i think that uh you know this may this may be a cause rather the actual topic but uh i think that a lot of this is caused by the steady diet of violence they seem to yep want to be uh you know showing on movies and television yeah and i also think that the uh fact that a lot of mothers are working today and that children are not bonded to the parents um-hum and other people take the responsibility for raising these kids or the children are left out you know that's true on their own and they don't really feel the family um closeness that we had when oh when i was growing up my my mother didn't work you know and when she did uh a part time job she was there you know it wasn't like she well well what seems to be the answer is to concentrate on uh you know the children getting mothers back in the home well yeah well i don't know if that's you know kind of going to be necessarily workable but it would be uh one way oh i know i know it certainly has to start with the children how do you feel about it do you do you think there should be capital punishment yes i do i think it's uh something that unfortunately uh at this stage of the game i would hope that at some point we would become you know civilized enough where we could do away with it but as of right now and the way things are i think it's uh something we just have to have yeah i i do myself i really think that it's it's all well and good to um be a do-gooder or to to um you know try to spare everyone's life but when someone has no regard for another person excuse me their property or their personal uh being or their families i mean you know when whole families are killed and um-hum and and yet you have someone who'll commit a crime of robbery and spend twenty five years in jail i mean to me it's like we have things messed up somehow you you know what i mean yeah and and like this banking crisis thing where people have stolen millions of dollars and they're out walking around huh well i just uh i think all our laws are are really screwed up i do i i don't know what to do about it i wish i did but uh well i think it comes back to uh starting with the children once you get them you know if you get them yeah where they have a sense of values and uh you know that uh that's what it takes yeah exactly morals yeah that people start uh oh you know repeat about it you know they start to see this violence in a steady diet and uh it's to be uh just did you ever see the program uh Why Does Johnny Kill uh about these young children who were were not even like sixteen years old they were eleven and twelve and fourteen and fifteen year olds and they they actually committed murders and the question was whether to try them as adults or as children all right can't remember that and whether or not to uh institute you know capital punishment where it was necessary and things like that yeah that has to that's a tough one too yeah i i mean what would you do in a situation like that you say well he's only ten years old but the crime he committed is that of an adult yeah he made that decision we had a personal experience with something like that it wasn't didn't go as far as murder but this this girl young girl had uh she had gotten hold of a gun and she came around to the office where my wife worked and she was she had this mental problem with uh with a doctor she works for him and uh he was she was just after him you know and the cops pick her up uh-huh and uh there wasn't a thing they could do you know they'd take her down to the juvenile hall and then they'd have to let her go and she'd be back doing it yeah imagine so see this is what i'm saying and even with uh people who are mentally incompetent you know uh like deranged it's so hard to get people even institutionalized because they're overcrowded so you have people walking the streets that are child molesters or uh  okay i'm a meat and potato man yeah you are huh yeah i love to cook outdoors you barbecue steaks barbecue steaks and fry fish but uh no exotic foods although i did order a uh a uh wok that i saw advertised on TV and i'm looking forward to getting that and cooking some Chinese food oh okay pardon me but uh i think my standard thing when i have company and i'm not too brave trying new recipes so a lot of times i will get the grill out and sometimes we do like surf and turf like we'll get some little filets wrap them up with bacon and then maybe do some little salmon steaks at the same time so that's my husband's deal he's out there you know yeah with the grill trying to get those things he likes to put sometimes even hickory chips on the barbecue you know get a little different flavor yeah and then you do your mashed potato and your salad you can't go wrong with that that'll push please pretty much any guest i like to kind of make my own barbecue sauce oh you do yeah i'll take some of the uh thick and rich barbecue sauce and put a little red wine in it a little uh uh liquid smoke uh-huh ooh um-hum a little soy sauce and uh some uh seasoned salt mix all that up together and put it on the steak um okay tastes pretty good gives it a kind of a hickory flavor but uh grill i have i i don't normally put hickory chips in it but it's got the uh uh rocks uh-huh in the bottom of it and a lot of times the the juice from prior steaks will give it a a good flavor oh okay my only other standard menu i guess is uh Thanksgiving i know how to put the bird in cook the bird and make all the trimmings oh yeah oh yeah yeah i can remember the big Thanksgiving dinners my mother would make yeah well what kind of things do you normally have with it people have different ideas of what goes with it yeah uh you mean Thanksgiving yeah uh i i can make a meal just out of the the uh uh corn bread dressing and goblet gravy oh okay and uh cranberry sauce i i could eat just that and be satisfied yeah my uh mother-in-law is into the corn bread stuffing now i never really had that much before i came to Texas but she is always she makes her corn bread and then of course you know she uses that to to make the stuffing we didn't do that so much uh i'm from kind of like Ohio area and uh we're you know not into the corn bread as much so our stuffing was um lot of times was uh like sausage or what not we would make it with you know varied uh meats like that yeah inside the turkey and then of course we always had to have mashed potatoes oh yeah and your standard vegetables like you always had to have some peas and corn peas and corn and green beans but uh and you got to have your cranberry sauce now i like jellied kind got to have the cranberry sauce yeah and you got to have your pumpkin pie so being from the north i guess corn bread and black eye peas are strange are strange to you well yeah most people never from north when we mention having black eye peas and corn bread and green onions yeah and it's funny because people call things differently in different areas um my parents grew up a lot in the Philadelphia area i was very young when we lived there but you call things differently like um uh we called them all hoagies down here they call them submarine sandmiches yeah yeah and we didn't ever call it uh Cokes and such you know we call it soda yeah um so it's just different terminology for the same thing different terminology i don't care much for those subs there's too much bread for me i don't like that much bread yeah that's it's a different kind of bread and it's somewhat of a harder crust it's not the soft yeah you know kind of uh rolls that they have here it was a harder crust and some of the hoagies were cooked like the Philadelphia um steak yeah the the hoagie steak that they they sell but uh Thanksgiving i i don't really care that much for turkey it's too dry for me um i'll eat the dark meat but you can have the white meat that's like eating sandpaper well what is it for um New Year's lot of people make ham and sauerkraut yeah well also New New Year's down here you've got to have black eyed peas they're supposed to bring you good luck or good or good finances uh i think they cook cabbage up north i think that's one of the things they want i'm not sure i'm not i'll eat it as long as i'm not around while it's being cooked now we always had a ham like on uh uh Easter yeah you always have to have a ham or something on Easter yeah i much prefer ham than i do turkey on Thanksgiving i think last let me try to think i think the last time we had a big meal like that we did have both i think we did have both on Thanksgiving just in case people you know have a variety well plus ham if you're going to give a party or something ham's always good for one thing you can carve it and eat it with your hands you don't have to have a plate yeah but you can just snack on it oh that's true well um you work here at the Expressway site i work at the Lewisville site oh Lewisville any decent food in your cafeteria up there uh-huh i i've heard people that uh have come and visited that plant that uh from other plants that our cafeteria is head and shoulders above the others really yeah that's what i've heard oh but of course you you know you eat day in and day out at one particular particular place and i guess you get tired of it or whatever and it doesn't seem like it's um-hum as good as as people say it is hum well i normally work in the north building and um you would think that since you know the executives are there that we would have a pretty good one but i don't know i think it's just kind of standard like we've got anything while they do cater to the executive dining room but i think they give them different food yeah i think so too and i i at Lewisville i'm not fond of their vegetable selection oh uh they have as far as i'm concerned because i'm i'm not a big vegetable eater they have too many uh yellow vegetables on the same day and it seems seems like it's it's a variety of the same type of vegetable um like they'll have uh they'll have broccoli and they'll have squash and cauliflower all on the same day um and that that doesn't i'm i like more of a variety than that in fact one day they they had they had three kinds of potatoes they had mashed potatoes they had French fries and they had au gratin now that is a little overdoing it that's overdoing it well my husband he used to complain at the cafeteria because it seemed like so many of their different items they always added garlic to it like he would get tuna salad this is what is that and the first ingredient no matter what you're making garlic yeah and he said tuna salad shouldn't taste garlicky but everything always seemed to have a garlic flavor to it yeah yeah and every once in a while they'll have dressing but uh whoever makes it uh goes crazy with the sage um got to to strong of a sage taste to it um but uh i usually i can usually find something to eat there even if it's a hamburger well i'm i spend a lot of time over in Park Central yeah but we have just a little deli downstairs but in the mornings they make these really good muffins yeah they don't make a lot of them and i don't think they make them at other places this little deli is like RC Cooper it's a little place you know it's a little chain here in town it's real small but uh they make the best muffins we're talking it's a real good size one you know and they make them different flavors like um-hum oh they have a chocolate chip one poppy seed is my favorite and uh they'll have like a banana nut and a apple one and a zucchini and a blueberry yeah really good they usually pretty much go fast they don't make a lot of them You have to get here early in the morning yeah yeah they have muffins there at the TI cafeteria too in the mornings pretty good yeah they got uh blueberry and i guess it's apple or some kind of a maybe cinnamon cinnamon apple it's it's got the cinnamon on top of it um-hum hum and uh they're pretty good sized too but i usually wind up getting a donut a chocolate donut well you ought to try a muffin if you haven't yeah like i really need the cholesterol oh well we all indulge right um yep but i love to cook i wish i was a better cook than i was but i i love to cook well i don't like them cleaning up the dishes yeah i know my husband he'll cook every once in a while but like the kitchen is a disaster area afterwards yeah because he has to get everything out and he loves to season i mean he's like he gets every seasoning out of the cupboard you know and uses it and he likes to put lemon yeah  so what kind of eating out do you like oh preferably Mexican food or seafood yeah i i like seafood or Chinese or especially Mongolian we've got a real nice little Mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week it's not bad you know oh really hum wow you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the the two meat the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal yeah yeah oh yeah we uh we haven't found a whole you know the are the best Mexican food we've found is back in Houston naturally and uh same goes for the seafood of course to there's not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere yeah no but uh you know i think our luxury here is Red Lobster and uh but back home there's you know different places family owned seafood restaurants oh yeah do you do yeah do you have a Steak do you have a Steak and Ale there uh not close about an hour away in Waco there's the closest one um i haven't been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good yeah uh it's been a while since i've been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there yeah instead of the seafood yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks yeah yeah uh-huh and now that i'm full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies consequently that's why you go out to Mongolian all the time yeah oh so no i i pretty you know Mexican food or or seafood pretty much i could probably live on that yeah i haven't found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i'm at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my i'm partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i've had out so oh there you go and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way yeah yeah right right well what do you like about your your Chinese food place there that makes you keep going back and places place uh basically the food and the price i it's sort it's set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill uh-huh and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that oh all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh or Thais and they can't speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that it's okay the food is really good oh yeah i don't know i to me that's the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you're obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again right course a yeah yeah i mean it's it's not worth the hassle just for the good food there's plenty of places that have good food yeah uh right yeah um there's there's a couple places around here that we'll go back to now and again um one being a a Chinese food place and and another one being another Mexican food place and and it it just seems that if the if the help is is good and they're like they're supposed to be that you know you're you're tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason uh-huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody's rude to me or excuse me somebody's rude or something like that i won't go back i don't care how good the food was yeah but generally i i the places i've been where i've had trouble with the help generally the food hasn't been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem yeah yeah uh well gosh now what i guess it's been about five minutes now what let's see how long do you eat do you go out once a week i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh see my my ex-college buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and there's some pretty good places down there to eat yeah but we've got a uh family there's a family restaurant here i don't know if they're over in Texas yet i know they're in Louisiana it's called Ryan's um it's a it's a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or hum uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they've just got tons of stuff and it's really cheap one person for about it's about six bucks and it's all you can eat uh-huh wow and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it's serve yourself can't complain too much they they they have people come around and uh yeah right so you can't complain about that really deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don't they don't bother you so it's a pretty good place i bet you don't have those over there i don't think so i haven't heard of it we have uh there's two of them in Charlotte and we've been to both of them and they're both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i've been in a lot of Ryan's in Alabama and Georgia oh no and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible oh and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh it's it's a pretty neat chain because they they don't take out loans for anything they made you reconsider hm oh when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they're making money immediately it's it's a smart operation hum right well that's a good way to go about it yeah there's there's kind of a a little place set up like that i know that they've got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in uh Houston it's called You Are Cook and that's exactly what you are and it a it turned out it's a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so it's an ongoing circle uh-huh you know and you uh you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these three huge grills that they have set up for the p eople to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is and they're just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the smallest the smallest they have is um-hum yeah um uh i think a nine ounce filet i mean just we're taking taking doggy bags home every time we go and it's it's it's like twelve dollars a person but you are you're getting three or four meals out of it by the time you take it home i would yeah exactly and and you and you cook it yourself yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or or they'll cook it they'll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you gosh that's half the fun cooking it yourself yeah it's really a lot of fun because they get up there and well that's that's an interesting sounding place yeah season it and throw it on the grill and and you know sit around and and just talk while it's cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to take their own steak back to their table but uh it's really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i don't want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but it's really a it's really a neat phenomena how it all works out yeah yeah yeah that sounds pretty neat it'd be worth giving a try yeah yeah if you're ever in or around the area do give it a try because it's really good food that's pretty interesting i've never heard of anything like that yeah i'm not sure where all you know he's Texas bound obviously because i haven't heard him go any farther than those three cities but that it's it's really neat too so yeah huh that's a unique idea i guess i guess that's part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea yeah yeah yeah and it's it's and i and you know the fact that it's his own cattle it's just an ongoing yeah he he surely doesn't have to worry about supply right right that's a pretty good idea huh maybe i'll start a restaurant now so yeah yeah you got all these tips i don't know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though probably burn the place down oh yeah i bet you can't get find Mexican food over there i had always wondered what i'd do if i lived somewhere other than Texas well come to think i've never even seen a Mexican here we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but gosh oh well hum oh well well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesn't it i guess so some of the subjects i tell you yeah well they've they've been a lot worse yeah right it was good talking to you Jackie you have a good night um bye-bye you too Dave you too bye-bye  oh mostly we watch college basketball oh do you yeah and uh you know we're from uh originally from Louisville Kentucky and they've got a fairly decent ball club down there uh-huh yeah it's been around for a long time hadn't it uh as long as i can remember yeah who's the coach's name Denny Crum yeah that sounds familiar yeah Denny Crum's pretty good yeah he uh i don't know he's got a million dollar contract when he quits and with pro ball you mean uh no with uh uh when he quits they'll give him a million dollars who will the opponents Denny Crum uh uh Louisville University the university gives him a million dollars when he quits well why that doesn't make sense does it because because he's good and it's giving him an incentitive to stay around and uh he's been there for something twenty something years uh-huh and uh i really don't know the uh full reason why they're doing it but they've got confidence in the man yeah yeah well to me i'd want to quit oh he gets too much he gets you know he oh that just shows how much he gets paid anyway yeah huh he's got a TV show down there and everything really where are y'all living now in Denison Denison Texas yeah do you ever watch the Mavericks sometimes yeah not a lot uh i i don't really care for pro basketball i like college basketball and pro football hm but i do watch some uh pro football basketball mostly it's uh i watch certain players yeah like who oh Magic Johnson uh uh-huh Larry Bird yeah uh Michael Jordan yeah he's good too and i can name a few more i just can't think of their names right off hand uh i used to watch basketball in fact of of the pro sports i guess it's my favorite it's just that i haven't watched many sports this year or in the past several years yeah well the uh NC double A tournament's going on right now and uh i haven't watched it this year because Louisville's out of it this year how come oh they just uh they had three tall guys who had uh didn't meet the requirements you know uh the uh academic requirements uh-huh yeah yeah academically they didn't meet the requirements so they couldn't play this year so four of them they had four people huh my husband's sitting here putting four fingers in my face four uh but they weren't very good but they was uh four out of five hurts huh four out of five hurt yeah well i think they got i think that was almost everyone of them that he recruited uh recruited for this year huh he didn't and none of them got to play yeah well no wonder they're out of it uh sorry i said no wonder they're out of it yeah well they put up a good show they did pretty good for uh yes you know having all short people and uh we only had uh-huh one we only had one senior on the team so they'll be back so next year they'll be back and back with a vengeance uh-huh well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic in some states yeah because it's reasonable now uh you know me with me being from Louisville i'm going to say at Louisville is unfair because Louisville's got the highest uh uh the line the line the line drawn i don't know the correct word for it but Louisville's is higher than most other universities and uh-huh well i didn't realize it could vary from state to state or university yeah yeah they they vary from university not just state to state university huh if they'd been anywhere else i don't you know i don't care where it was anywhere in the United States they could have played but beings they was in Louisville they couldn't play how does that coach feel about that oh he's highly upset he uh went on uh he was on uh Twenty Twenty or Sixty Minutes i can't remember which one and got blasted uh you know they uh that's where it all came about because he said a few remarks of uh on that uh talk show or uh-huh news show and then they uh next thing you know well they're in violation if they don't uh if they stop if they keep playing they're in violation hm so but uh Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much him on national TV on national TV he messed up but uh yeah it's all politics probably that's probably what it mostly is i i can't say say that for sure but you know uh right now though Kentucky's just now getting off of a uh their yeah suspension from playing on uh TV and then games um-hum next year they'll be uh playing and i know Memphis State was even in a few of them where they got uh couldn't play huh in uh games and stuff because of uh uh Dana Kirk that was their coach down there uh or over there uh he he was uh we was living in Memphis for a while that's why i know about Memphis State uh-huh uh he was selling soda machines at the uh selling like Coca-Cola had given him uh-huh uh for this little uh this little uh kid's a a basketball camp that's what it is these little kids would come here and uh Coca-Cola had sponsored the uh sodas you know just give them to him told him to give them to the boys well he sold them for something like fifty seventy five cents to these boys when he's supposed to given them to them uh-huh uh-huh oh for heaven's sake what a cheapskate and uh yeah he was a he's uh we call him Dana Jerk yeah oh yeah and he blames all of his uh tax problems on his elementary school wife his elementary school wife yeah yeah she she never even got out of elementary school oh really um well she might have been the cause of it well no he was just a jerk he put uh he put the blame on everyone but himself he went out and you know bought uh bought recruits yeah yeah no i'm sure you know that's one thing you don't do uh yeah he went out and did that and he got caught and then he got caught with the taxes and then he got caught with the sodas and that soda really went over on the people in Memphis they really got hot about that yeah i can imagine especially the kids that were buying them yeah these were young kids too they couldn't have been out of middle school yeah huh well that almighty dollar yeah well that's uh yeah i'll agree there um-hum more powerful than you think yeah it is well i think we met our time limit yeah i think guess we did too all right well well you have a good day so uh-huh thank you very much bye-bye bye-bye  i think i was one okay um first thing i thought of was was just the men that put the flyers on the door and i'm a Christian and i think i feel sorry for people that have to do that you know what i mean i always pray for the guys but when i'm sitting on my couch and it's and a man just walks up and puts his hand on my doorknob uh-huh it's kind of frightening like whoa and i've i've kind of gotten used to it but it seems kind of bizarre to me to get used to some stranger just coming up from the side because you can't see them approaching your house you know they just uh-huh yeah because they're just sort of coming from the side or whatever yeah exactly and when i'm sitting here on the sofa cross-stitching and all of a sudden somebody a man's got their hand on my door knob it's like uh like oh no and so i don't i don't like that and i guess the only way to prevent it would be just to pass a city ordinance to prevent that or uh-huh you know so i think there's other ways to advertise other than a flyer on your door yeah plus uh you know look at the you know the besides the pollution the the aspect of invasion of privacy there's a big pollution aspect too i find i throw out a lot of those flyers and i have no interest in uh-huh whatever they are i i do i find and and they go alone with that just the things you get in the mail right uh-huh i you know my my name being sold if i if i give money to the World Wild Wildlife Federation you know it's a it's a i feel it's an invasion of privacy to receive so many pieces of junk mail because they sell my address uh-huh right right i do too even the credit card things and like we have a Visa and we've got we get ten applications probably a month uh-huh yeah that's i agree yeah and it for other Visas and it's like wait a minute we have a commitment with the company we're with if i want a Visa from your company i'll call you yeah i'll call you that's right and they all say that they're the best Visa but you know i definitely have the one that i've yeah yeah you know very rarely do you receive one that has a real low interest rate they're always more expensive and they uh you know if you stay if you stay with a good one for the while you get a good credit rating and you get a good um a good credit line so you don't like to i don't like to bother with it yeah right it shows stability but um now i also thought uh i i get calls i'm a housewife so i'm home a lot in the day um uh-huh and i i get probably four calls probably four a day probably three day a norm but seems like it seems like it's more than that of phone calls and and it i've gotten to where i've really had to say okay wait a minute this you know it's okay to be nice and sometimes you know i feel like God says talk to this person or something but most of the time i just have gotten where i can say i'm not interested thank you and i just hang you know and i hang up real nicely but yeah huh um i know a few months ago i i would feel that i had to explain to them that i'm on the other line or i'm in the middle and it's i've just come to a realization that i don't have to explain to this stranger what i'm doing it and give excuses that's it's okay just to say i'm not interested and go ahead and hang up but i i don't know i don't think most people are secure enough to probably answer um-hum that's right like that and therefore i feel it's an invasion of privacy because i thought all these people share you know what they're doing even though it's none of the business yeah that's right it takes uh uh-huh and i did it for a long time and and i just i feel like that was one i thought of that right off yeah they ask you a lot of they ask you a lot of personal questions and they yep and you know they and they just keep talking to you too i i i find that a big pain yeah i think yeah right they don't want to let you go they don't believe you if you're on another line long distance and they just want to keep going and going and stuff so uh-huh yeah i think do you find that as a woman that you probably see more things of invasions of privacy than uh a man would um yeah i probably do i feel like i don't know i'm a Christian i feel like women are more usually deceived you i feel like i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because God gave us husbands and fathers to help look out for us but i know that during the day yeah the when the cults come by they come by during the day and it says in the Bible that be weary of the people coming door to door trying to proselytize the silly women lay captive with gossip and stuff and i see that they don't come home when my husband's here they don't come to my house normally when my husband's here they come when i'm here alone and i notice that and it's almost like uh-huh there's a a subconscious understanding i think it's spiritual that you can rationally explain the subconscious understanding that you know there's there's a more gullibility here when there's not a huh a man present i don't think i'm less than a man because of that i but i see that and God's really shown me that and i don't talk to them i don't try and witness to them don't try and convert them i just say you can you can either you can come back when my husband's here uh-huh yeah if you'd like to but we're Christians good-bye and i shut the door and that's it and i'm not ugly to them you know what i mean yeah what you know what's really funny um is that i get calls you know mostly telephone sales people that i just you know that want to start beating my ear you know uh-huh right and um and then they start asking you know well is your wife there and then i'm thinking well how did they know i was married you know and i'll say i'll say no she's not because actually my wife and i live apart right now because i'm in graduate school and um right so i only get to see her on Thursday through Monday and it's one of those things where they'll say oh your wife's not there and i'll say i'll say no oh well when is she going to be there and i'm like well she's never going to be there yes she's never going to be here so you know yeah are you kidding oh man they do that really oh yeah uh-huh and and they'll keep going until they get that out of you when your wife is going to be here because they want us to be here together because i guess uh it's it's see i she can talk you into that most a lot of women yeah maybe she would talk me in yeah maybe they'll a lot of women most women control the budgets and they control the money and they control the husband i mean most of the time that's how it works so so therefore i guess that they their they see that um yeah uh-huh yeah they they do what do you think i just just threw out stuff tonight that uh i walked out of a grocery store and a fellow said you know for a dollar you can win this five hundred dollars worth of groceries so they feel like i can talk her into and normally when you see these things it's normally um uh a church you know that's doing a raffle or it's some type of boy scouts or it's some type of group or whatever and i automatically you just think oh it's a raffle must be for the kids uh-huh you know so you pull out your dollar and you fill out this coupon and uh-huh and then when you look at it as you walking away you see that it's for some sales pitch of some kind where they're going to you know and i find that a big invasion of privacy i just i'm from then on in it's like oh this makes me angry you know now you have to question everybody on what they're doing now you sure this goes to such and such organization uh-huh and you sure you're with multiple dystrophy muscular dystrophy or whatever i find that a big invasion of privacy too yeah uh-huh because they they sort of pull that over on you you know like um like this is a charitable organization but actually it's not it's a come on so that they can get your name and phone number uh-huh so because you always put your phone number down so they can call and tell you that you won huh but actually they started calling me telling me that i could you know buy a soft water softener and they called me for um what else other than water softener the same place called me for yeah oh great something else in my kitchen it was all kitchen stuff they put me on and they all called me you know and each one asked me when my wife was going to be here that's funny uh-huh oh they're i know it's funny how you can look back as a Christian you can see how these things apply and they're true and in even even in people that aren't even Christians there's just a pattern uh-huh that you can see in things like that i've noticed that about the cults that they work our neighborhood in the day and they work them good and i consider that i kind of consider that an invasion of privacy but not so much as i do the other uh-huh you know what i mean because but i do in to a degree there's also not a day to day occurrence it's not that often that they come by but i've notice it's kind of gone down before when we first moved here it was pretty often but i've noticed that though they really work in the day and you very rarely see them in the evening because the men are home and so well i think also you know in the the if men are home during the day they're they're um they might be unemployed men who might be more apt to um right you know be at the end of their rope you know and be looking for uh uh a salvation in the sense or looking for a uh saving grace you know i right looking for something yeah kind of depressed or something looking for something yeah they're searching for something yeah and also and also you know the woman at home during the day if if the housewife is at home um yeah i didn't think of that but yeah that's good she may be bored at the time so she'll spend a little bit more time to listen i think you know because she may have finished her work the kids may be taking a nap they may uh they may be playing some place you know or uh-huh yeah right and and there's nobody but there's no husband there to come in and say wait a minute yeah you know i really think this is good and that well i don't know i think we need that but i know i need it um-hum but um the only thing i would have thought of is my husband just said this he said public bathrooms he he said what public bathroom well he was teasing but he was just being smart because because you know you don't want to go in the public you know that's an invasion of privacy oh that's true that's true what can we do to solve that we can make the architects for all the buildings make private stalls for everyone i thought that was funny but uh-huh what you know the the terrible thing is i don't know if you've watched the news lately i i guess we just had something up here here i'm in Baltimore Maryland uh-huh so um i get you know we i saw some news out of like New Hampshire and a big thing in the courts right now is um they don't have enough stalls in women's bathrooms as they do men's bathrooms that's funny so that men you know because men design these things men can go in and use the urinal or use the toilet but their lines are always you know they go through much faster but but the women have to wait in long lines that are uncomfortable and and if they really have to go it's a very difficult problem to be you have to stand in line for an hour and uh and then the whole yeah i did hear that on the news  well how do you feel about it well uh i don't have any strong convictions about it that's for sure um i know i haven't done any Peace Corps service and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that has or you know has ever even thought about it do you know uh do you know anybody that's been it no the the only people i know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries and that's only because i went to Baylor and a lot of students from Baylor go and and serve as missionaries during the summer but i think i think that's a terrible idea that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity yeah i mean it it's nice to to try to teach young people some some uh uh civil uh consciousness but forcing them to to donate basically their time and efforts yeah it's definitely up to the person uh so i'd have to say that uh it you know the people who do it well some feel it's rewarding i don't know you know but uh i don't know how we got the subject you know i have nothing to say about this it it i don't either i don't either i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i don't i don't really have an opinion except for no i think that's dumb um-hum well how long you been in San Antonio but uh i've been here for um just uh almost five years well no almost four years okay and i lived with Dana in school okay that's how we know each other and uh you you were just up there then huh uh-huh last weekend we went to Six Flags Saturday uh oh okay yeah a good old time well that's good well back to the topic at hand what other types of community service would they be talking about i mean the the recording mentioned the Peace Corps well it sounded like i mean this is like major long term commitment like a year or six months or yeah so you're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe or you know i don't know i mean but uh i mean i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes like i do some volunteer work here and there and every once in a while i'll do uh a uh local Big Brother Big Sister thing um-hum or i'll go you know do a but that that time is minuscule compared to what what it sound like they were referring to yeah yeah i i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to to go do something yeah yeah they couldn't cover my hourly rate i couldn't afford it no kidding but uh i have this thing against bugs too and seems to me like the Peace Corps they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs yeah Africa a lot of yeah have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die yeah well i doubt that but you know i guess well i i mean it would it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture usually i guess i think that maybe that's why some people do it is yeah uh to see the other cultures or you know and some of that but um-hum uh to do that i don't know i'd have to be i don't know oh i don't know either the other growing up all i knew was oh you go to high school you you know you work you go to college you get out of college and you get a good job and you work and and none of this you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to expand to broaden your horizons um-hum well you know uh i know American Express i'm now i'm working at American Express now and they uh-huh after a certain amount of years of service these employees can take off like six months or something for some type of sabbatical or some you know some something like that uh-huh and they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off oh so it is something that i think uh you know even the larger organizations will support uh it's really it's really for the community to give you know to to give back to the community type of thing i'm for i don't know pretty it's for yeah i think at the same time it's for some people to you know help them grow in other areas kind of like joining the military well i mean in that respect a lot of people join the military to to grow up yeah maybe and to decide what they want to do and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as as that kind of a time yeah maybe a little bit in that perspective but uh i know a lot of people that have gone in the military i mean in you know when they're in the college sometimes it's to support help support college you know the money um-hum uh others people don't know what they want to do but as far as uh you know the Peace Corps i guess i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives but i think a lot of it's you know when the people get older they'll do something like that i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps yeah i i i don't but i don't and none of my didn't mean to cut you off there oh that's okay none and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything so i don't really know anyone first hand that's that's committed committed a chunk of their life to do service work everybody i know has been well i'm going to go get a job good job and make some money and buy a nice car uh i know so or try or try to make a living yeah but uh yeah i i have no i don't know anybody that's that done that either so i it's it's interesting we got this topic because i i i don't know what i marked off to get this but i certainly didn't mark off anything to get this one i can't i can't imagine and the switchboard's been down for several days and the last time i called it before it went down i had this topic and i didn't feel like talking about it so i hung up and i guess they they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it so you had the same one huh yeah oh well well you you'll get it over with here i know it how many times have you talked oh probably five or six yeah not a whole lot oh i've done maybe four or five yeah did Dana sign you up for this well she just sent me the information out i i got a hold of it you know i just sent it back in and yeah that's she stuck my name on some list so they mailed me the information that i filled out what other topics have you had well that's pretty um i've talked about camping with someone i've talked about the weather great great that one was interesting because i talked to a man in in Washington DC and it was hot here and it was snowing there so that was pretty interesting um-hum and i talked to someone about the uh the uh education system i forget exactly what the focus was on that one but that was fairly interesting and i've talked to somebody about credit card usage yeah and and i talked to this person who i gathered from speaking to her that that she and her family just didn't have much and they didn't have much credit available to them um-hum and so she basically didn't use credit cards and didn't know very much about them and how they work and and how you can use them to your advantage and and how you know you hm yeah i always you can do certain things with them i use everything with my Visa and i pay it all off so that's a good deal for me i get free money for thirty days so yeah yeah that's the way i use them uh i try i try to make sure i don't get in debt so yeah yeah well that's always a good plan i can't think of anything else that i've talked about all the the most most of the ones on the list i checked off stuff like football and and stuff that i can i i would enjoy talking about and i haven't gotten a one of them yet when i've called i had uh let's see i've had fishing and uh i can't remember me and i think me and Dana had football yeah we did oh how funny yeah uh we so we talked about the Cowboys a little bit and i'm out here in Phoenix so we talked about Phoenix Cardinals and um-hum so so that one was all right and then what else i had i think i had some other uh like staying in shape or working out this other guy i got this guy from New York so i had to talk to someone about hobbies and the switchboard called me so i was caught a little off guard and i couldn't think of anything at all so i started making stuff up i told this woman that my hobby was gardening and i can't even i can't even grow an ivy my grandfather gave me a plant once that told and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill you could freeze it you could and you've probably never gardened in your life you could dry it out no matter what you couldn't kill it well i killed it pretty quick yeah i don't i don't have too much of a green thumb either so i do have one plant here it's been hanging out for a while but i think it's one of your easiest plants i can't i don't know the name of it but i'm not too much into  okay do you um have a garden um i have several outside shrubs that i maintain take care of um-hum do you enjoy working out in the yard yeah i certainly do uh i planted uh a rosebed last year um-hum and uh they came out looking really nice lot of red and white ones pink uh-huh i've had some roses out in my backyard too and they've done real well i was surprised i we had some in Virginia and they were real hard to keep up with but seems like they like the Texas climate better uh yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh lot of uh oh some some plant food once a month right yeah we built up our we built up boxes and put them in that so that they would drain because our soil is so bad where i live do you live in Texas or yeah i'm in uh Plano Plano oh yeah i'm out in Rowlett and we have that brown clay soil and it's real hard to grow anything here yeah i've got a well my roses are on the west side of the house i asked my neighbors what they wanted to see outside their uh front door uh-huh because it's right by their entryway and they they wanted roses so that's what i planted oh that's accommodating um-hum yeah and i still need to assess the damage outside from the the freeze this winter yeah i've got quite a few dead shrubs some and oleander right we've got a few things too it's hard to tell if they'll come back or not yeah the trees are all doing really well i've got a nice Japanese maple out front that uh looking really nice right now well that's good we we planted three pecan trees out front and every one of them died i told my husband this is the last one if it dies we're going to something else uh-huh but we dug a hole about six times as big as it needs to be and filled it with all kinds of compost and pine needles and everything else we could think of hopefully it'll drain this year yeah yeah every year uh there's some freeze damage and i lose different uh variety of shrubs yeah have to go replace them with uh something a little hardier yeah it's hard to find something that'll take the heat as well as the freezing um-hum that we get down here i have a few little flowers i plant around the trees out front i've enjoyed doing those i put uh pansies out in the winter and they pretty much last all winter and then i put uh moss rose out in the summer and it just goes crazy you don't really have to do anything to it uh-huh puts a lot of color out there yeah i don't do much with flowers myself i just get a lot of evergreen evergreen type shrubs some uh all year right some uh dwarf Burford hollies and Yaupon hollies oh yeah those do pretty well here don't they they do very well um-hum we've got my husband put a little row of those out in the backyard to kind of make a little cut so that the kids wouldn't come marching through the yard and everything yeah they make a nice hedge uh yeah and the nice thing about those types of hollies is you don't have to trim them uh into a boxy type hedge you can just let them uh grow their natural uh shape right yeah the only thing i don't like about them is weeding around them because they get so sharp pricky things get in your hands oh yeah oh i've got some Chinese Hollies that are just outrageous they they are very sharp oh really do you do your own uh lawn maintenance or do you hire somebody to uh to do that yeah we do it my husband does most of the mowing and edging and all that stuff yeah i do that myself too i i really don't appreciate them calling me up all the time to try to push their services on me yeah we get something on the door about every week because i've got a very small yard the entire size of the lot is only forty five by ninety feet uh-huh it's what they call low maintenance yard and these uh uh maintenance uh companies call up wanting to uh uh put put the uh weed killer and the fertilizer down and they want they want to charge forty or forty five dollars per application for my size yard i i don't spend that much in a year yeah really oh our neighbor has a lawn service come and do his and i don't think it looks any better than what my husband does so uh-huh i'm not really tempted to do that either if it doesn't take much work yeah i can mow the backyard but there's something about the grass in our front yard is so dense huh uh-huh that the mower wheels just kind of bog down in there and i can not push it yeah i've got a little electric mower and i i will never buy another one of those again oh really it's fine for my size yard but uh it really doesn't have the power of a gas motor huh i would like a self-propelled one i think um-hum that might make it easier it's better for for a large yard yeah ours is not that big but like i said if i had to mow the front i'd be stuck because i can't get it to move yeah before i moved down here when i was up uh north in Wisconsin living with my folks they lived on uh three and a half acres of land and uh we started mowing that with a push mower oh uh they finally got smart and got a riding lawn mower which was a big improvement for for us us kids who had to go out there and uh mow the the grass every every week oh i'm sure yeah that's a pretty large area it it still took a few hours even with the riding mower really did people up there edge as pri as strictly and stuff as they do down here um not nearly as much as here uh i think it's probably because we lived out in the country somewhat and uh there just wasn't the emphasis on keeping the yards looking real nice yeah yeah i lived in a town it was a college town in Virginia and i mean people kept their lawns mowed but they sure didn't get into like they do here in Texas wasn't a source of pride or something like it is down here yeah a lot of people do but then again there are a lot who do nothing yeah my street uh is kind of in between there are a couple of uh neighbors who are are really good about planting flowers and trees um-hum but there the majority really haven't done anything with their yards this neighborhood is is four years old yeah and you would think that uh in that time they'd uh get their lawns and and gardens established yeah it's hard i know we tried to do our landscaping out front my husband tilled it up in the fall and then we've been waiting on some guy supposed to be getting us some edging for like ten cents a foot instead of a bout a dollar and uh he has never got it to us so it just sits out there kind of dug up and doesn't look too good so i can't say anything about anybody else's um-hum yeah i'd like to see the the neighbors put some trees in the front yards anyway just to get something started yeah it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer right you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree yeah yeah it's nice when the builders plant trees for you when when they build the house yeah did they not put any in in your neighborhood no uh my builder was Gemcraft and they didn't put uh trees in at all we had two trees in the front of our yard and then one of them died and so that's where we keep putting that pecan keeps dying we have uh i think it's a Silver Leaf Maple or something like that that's hung on out there yeah the trouble with with builders planting the trees is they they get the weaker varieties ones that aren't as desirable right and uh those include Arizona Ash and in some cases silver maples yeah hope ours continues to live it's been there about four i guess almost four years now so maybe it's established established enough that it'll go on and survive yeah that's probably true i've got a live oak in front uh i i really like the oaks a lot i like an oak oak trees yeah they're very hardy for this area my um husband's father has a place out in East Texas so he's always digging up little red oaks and things like that and trying to bring them back and start them but um-hum so far we haven't had much luck oh i had a red oak a few years ago that i bought from uh from a guy who sold trees off the back of a trailer and that was a mistake for uh well two reasons one thing it wasn't insured uh-huh oh and the other reason was that i bought it in spring and it was a balled and bur lapped tree uh right before summer the heat of summer it couldn't uh take the heat and it died oh yeah well that's too bad we've got all of our trees from Calloway's and luckily they'll take them back any time for any reason if they die yeah i usually go to Callaway's or Wolfe um-hum Callaway's tends to have nicer shrubs uh more fully developed uh-huh and uh i don't think there's a problem with the warranty on any of those places although they have cut back on their uh warranty for the shrubs the past couple of years yeah i know the guy at Wolfe told us they cut back on the tree warranty like six months or less yeah but Calloway's has kept theirs forever so really well that's good for trees i don't think they do that for shrubs yeah yeah i don't know we haven't bought i think it's still a year or less for uh for shrubs uh-huh we haven't bought any shrubs shrubs yet hopefully i think we've almost waited this too late this year now to start putting in anything of any size oh it's never too late to plant something unless unless well for trees if they're balled and bur lapped it's recommended to plant them in the fall or winter yeah but for uh just shrubs say five gallon or one gallon shrubs any time of the year is fine oh really it wouldn't matter if we plant them when it was starting to get warmer right just have to take care of them and water them uh so they get established put some uh uh some uh uh root stimulator yeah right right some uh stimulator down so uh yeah it's never a problem to plant things in the summer oh well that's good to know maybe there's still hope for our front yard this summer then i'm just waiting for a sale uh-huh they haven't really had any good sales on plants yet yeah i've i've noticed that they haven't had anything great so but once they uh drop the prices a little bit i'll be out there uh picking up a few more shrubs to fill in where we're where my dead shrubs are right now i haven't even pulled them out of the ground yet right yeah yeah last year we thought some were dead and finally they started leafing out again at the bottom so we just cut them way back and and was able to save them but this year they look even worse you have to watch the like the crepe myrtles um-hum because they'll look really bad like they're dead and all of a sudden they'll bud out yeah i've got several crepe myrtles that look just awful and uh there are buds coming out all over the place now huh ours haven't done anything yet this year i have a crepe myrtle tree in the backyard that still hasn't done anything and i'm kind of wondering what kind of shape it's in right now yeah i like crepe myrtles they really add a lot of color have to make sure they don't get out of hand in the summer oh we haven't had that problem yet they're pretty ours are pretty small they they can tight they can get out of control oh really but mine keep dying back down to the ground so i haven't had that problem yet yeah but i do have some really nice Boston ivy on the west side of the house oh does it grow along a fence or something grows on the on the brick oh on the house itself uh-huh that you have to really watch uh to uh keep it under control because they will take over a house if you don't uh tend to it uh-huh uh those things grow about an inch a day  okay okay well i guess i can tell you that tonight is Murphy Brown that's the one i don't miss and i don't know if you've seen that that's with Candace Bergen uh-huh i've never seen that before uh-huh i've heard about it but i've never watched in fact i don't usually watch TV on Monday nights i guess i'm either just really tired from the weekend and i get home well uh yeah really i have aerobics on Monday nights too i just didn't quite make it tonight because i was caught up at work for too long but um-hum oh jeez but uh yeah i i usually don't get home until eight o'clock so that's another good reason but uh-huh i'd say that's the only one i don't miss or i try not to miss that one and Cheers on Thursdays yeah i like Cheers uh-huh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually with any regularity uh-huh back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasn't doing aerobics and work wasn't quite as busy as it's been lately um i liked The Wonders Year's and uh um sometimes every now and then i'll catch Doogie Howser because i think that comes on at eight on Wednesday nights and that's about the time i get home from aerobics and i turn on the TV as i sit down to eat dinner and i'll catch that uh-huh my daughter watches that religiously we tape it for her because it comes on at nine here and she has to go to bed at eight thirty and uh so that you know we watch it too while we're taping it we watch it uh-huh um oh no yeah yeah it's kind of cute um yeah i like the lessons it's a good uh good it's got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one yeah yeah i like uh what is it on Tuesday oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night oh that's right Coach yes that's another one that i try not to miss although it use to be better i don't know it seems well yeah i like that one um i haven't seen it in a while yeah i was going to say i haven't seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with Christine um-hum uh-huh and i was thinking well do i really want her to go back with such a jerk i know i know it's funny that that women even like that show because he really is he's such a jerk but then it's just kind of funny because you you can sit there and laugh and go yeah what a guy typical uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah but uh that one's kind of cute i'm real bad i got hooked on a soap opera when i was in college General Hospital oh really everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didn't gather in the TV room at two o'clock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i really um uh-huh i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm my roommates watched General Hospital and they watched All My Children and some other soaps and i was going i'm not even going to be near that TV when they have any other soap on because i don't want to get stuck in another one one is bad enough no more but uh i know excuse me just a minute i think Katy get off the phone oops how old is she oh ten so she's been getting hearing about the the different calls and i've i've been in the middle of tests and stuff so i keep you saying oh press three sorry mom uh-huh yeah so let's see i was trying to think of i don't think i've ever watched any soap operas i think my mom used to watch Young and the Restless but i don't i don't watch them yeah don't ever start that's just the thing no well my my last boss's wife she oh gosh she would run the tape player from the minute she went to go do her aerobics and she used to do like um filing at the hospital uh-huh and i think she did some work at a thrift store so as long as she was gone for about four hours well maybe three she would tape soap operas oh gosh and uh she would watch them at night when she came home i just couldn't watch that much TV i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know he'll come home from work and there she'll be watching soap operas yeah hum yeah course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of TV watching time because they're really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything i've ever seen in my life but still i just don't think i could sit down for two hours oh really and especially two hours of soap operas i'd that'd be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long i'd kind of be like uh um-hum this is enough i can't take this any more this is disgusting right yeah well she's really she's really into it i guess but i never have gotten gotten used to well i just really never have been home i think during that time yeah um-hum um-hum and so i never had a chance and even when i was in school of course i always had classes about that time so i never had a chance but General Hospital huh is one to get hooked on if you're going to get hooked uh-huh yeah yeah i think so i mean i guess that's the only one i've ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched Dallas or Knots Landing or any of those things because it's like uh-huh no i don't want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week uh-huh i mean you can watch Coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait i'm missing an episode and i won't know what's going on right really and so that's fine and i like LA Law too that's another one and i've never watched that i going to have to watch that sometime it is pretty good i've watched it maybe five or six times but it comes on kind of late on Thursday nights and sometimes i'm trying to get things done and get in bed so i can go to work of of course for you it probably comes on really late on Thursday night come to think of it uh-huh yeah yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and uh i don't think Johnny Carson comes on until like eleven gosh oh gosh uh-huh so everything really that's what's really cut into my TV watching is the time that everything comes on since it's all shifted back an hour i just i don't really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes uh-huh um i can't stay up past ten thirty i'm falling asleep anyway so i miss most everything anyway uh-huh yeah but uh let's see yeah i haven't watched Johnny Carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch David Letterman and things like that in college and Love Connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because we'd get up in the in the apartment uh-huh and the guys from downstairs who by the wa y two of them were from San Antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and they'd come upstairs and watch it with us and we'd all sit there and uh-huh you know we'd be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but uh uh-huh i've never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh kind of yeah they have the three choices on video and it's usually real funny because they'll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didn't work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and oh God half the time they'll say well when he showed up at the door he didn't really look quite like his video and i just wasn't real sometimes they really burn each other it's really kind of funny but uh-huh that is terrible and the other person has to hear it yeah well then if the other person hears something like that they come back just as bad and he'll say well she underestimated her weight by quite a bit and they they just got you know they they go back and forth and it's kind of funny um oh uh-huh oh gosh uh-huh uh-huh and then you'll see the real funny looking couples and it's it's it was just entertaining and of course that was uh-huh that's been probably oh five six seven years ago since oh gosh i was going to say i never heard of that one The Love Connection we used to do that but uh i don't know if it even still comes on but that was always fun uh-huh oh yeah i hadn't heard that one let's see i can't oh gosh that that probably wipes out my whole inventory of TV shows other than um PBS i yeah right now they've got that Katherine Hepburn one where she's touring all the gardens of Europe i of course have missed the first series of that but that's about the only thing that i really catch on PBS um-hum um-hum yeah and uh we used to get Arts and Entertainment in San Antonio and i we get a little bit of the good ones here but we used to try and catch uh some of the stuff they had on there uh-huh and like i said i don't really watch TV too much any more uh yeah sometimes i'll turn on CNN or something like that in the morning when i if i i get really sick of the radio in the morning because they just they're so obnoxious oh uh-huh and so i'll turn on the TV and just i can hear it back in the bathroom and you know keep up kind of what's going on in the world so i'll do either CNN or Good Morning America or something like that but from time to time uh-huh uh-huh well we used to watch CNN because that was the only thing on really early that i could an update on all the news but with the war coverage i had had it with reporters um-hum yeah and the coverage and so after a while i just turned it off i said i can't take it any more i just can't yeah yeah i haven't watched it since the war started i CNN though was it was a life saver for me back in October uh-huh TI had sent me to Taiwan actually they sent me to six foreign countries Taiwan was right about in the middle and all they speak there is Chinese and in my hotel room there was nothing but Chinese programs on and they had CNN uh-huh oh and i just kept that thing on constantly because i was going English language this is wonderful and and they at least i kind of knew what was going on on the other side of the world and trying to keep up with uh-huh uh-huh okay what's the weather been like and what's happening back in the US because by then i'd been out of the country for three weeks already and i was i was you know wondering what's been happening lately but yeah i i never knew that i never even thought that they would have CNN on in Taiwan yeah believe it or not i guess that keeps anybody that's traveling that's American over there you'd think that they'd put it on in Chinese or translate it in Chinese yeah it was in English they had it in Tokyo too in English but they had they had they had Married With Children have you ever seen that before huh no i've heard about it i've seen a little bit of it it was kind of they had that on in Tokyo i watched it one night i've seen it here before a few times it's a real sarcastic type show it's kind of funny huh um i thought i can't believe they're playing that in Japan these people over there must think we are horrible i mean some of the American shows were some of the worst ones we have and that's what they're showing in Tokyo and i'm thinking i know that i didn't much uh-huh oh they must think Americans are just really terrible if they watch this they probably do you know if that's all they see of us oh God what a thought so next time i think of that next time i meet somebody from Japan they're going to think oh Married With Children yeah that's what she's like i mean yeah yeah it was pretty embarrassing she's like Peggy Bundy oh boy and he's like Al Bundy oh golly yeah because i i can't remember where i've seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking who'd think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if i'm going to spend my time but it was uh-huh yeah um a lot of um borderline jokes yeah uh  so uh how's the weather by you if it had rained any more in the last two weeks instead of planting Saint Augustine grass in the front yard i think i would have plowed everything under and had a rice field i i heard that it's been raining down there a little bit but it's really been that bad it's so bad wanted to mow today i was off and i wanted to mow the yard but just walking across it it's still so mushy if i took a mower out there i'd tear the sod up so bad really that bad huh is it is it typically this rainy i don't think it's typically this rainy by you down there is it it's steady but it's not in the amounts that we been getting normally we get an inch here and then a week or so will pass and you pick up another inch inch and a half we're getting hit by three and four inch bursts at a time oh God i guess you're getting all of California's rain well that's where the front had came come from they said it came out of the Pacific run across California who was really needing the rain it should've it should've stalled over them for a couple more days right oh they're getting another one later in the week there there was another one that was another storm um that was supposed to hit them like on Wednesday or something so i suspect it'll it'll wind it's way to you afterward it's not a pleasant thought so well maybe i maybe i can get the yard mowed before it hits well well i can uh i can understand that weather we're having uh we are it we had a late um um an ice storm here about two weeks ago which is you know um and and it's and it's they're calling it the worst ice storm in like the last hundred years and um and then to the point where about three hundred thousand people in our in our area lost power isn't it a little late in the season for that type of ice storm though and yeah oh yeah this is this is um well yeah up here in in in Rochester winter usually doesn't you know spring comes about this time March or April and um this was sort of unexpected it had actually been pretty fairly nice you know in the in the forties and um it had even been in the uh in the in the low fifties a couple of days in a row and then they actually they predicted it they said well we're going to have an ice storm coming up and then no one knew how bad it was going to be and it came in and in one night it basically destroyed it destroyed approximately one third of all the vegetation in um in like the three county area by us and about half the city owned trees in the city of Rochester are destroyed um we had i uh um my wife and i own our own home and we have a very big willow tree in our backyard that um that ninety percent of which came down in one night things like that it was a it it definitely is very um it was it was it wasn't supposed to be as bad they they have i i guess apparently you know ice storms here occasionally but never anything this bad this late in the season yeah i'd seen the storm you were talking about when it hit um up around the Chicago area uh they had a little film clip about how bad it was up there and i just could not believe how much ice that thing was carrying with it oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in the morning you know um we didn't we you you didn't sleep very well because every all all around you there were crashing sounds and and there were sounds of things breaking and you know you look you know we at one point we woke up to the sound of the uh the electric lines being ripped off our house and and things like that and then you go outside and everything is covered in ice i mean um you're talking about the lawn before being too mushy to mow um in our case it was just the opposite i mean the lawn was just a solid sheet of ice each blade of grass had a small individual covering of ice you know um maybe you know two or three millimeters thick but thick enough that you could actually see it my car was covered completely in ice it was in ice of about a half inch thick at one point how do you thaw one out after it's been coated like that i've always lived down in this part of the country and i'm not used you know we had an ice storm or a sleet well it and a good freeze and the windshield ices over and you take hot water or warm water out of the tap and thaw your windshield yeah um actually it turned out in our case um i know somebody who when they tried to defrost their car cracked their windshield um though occasionally it can be dethawed in our case we didn't um we didn't have the problem because my we keep my wife's car in the garage so her car didn't get iced over you know it wasn't um um it was a little bit cold in her car in the morning but it wasn't iced over so i just left my car out there for a couple of days and um within two or three days it was it was actually warm enough that everything melted um it was it was actually one of the most beautiful sights i've ever seen because everything looks you know if you can imagine just seeing everything coated in a nice clean sheet of ice and and and it looks really nice the whole whole place but um it got you know after the initial storm it got worse as things started to melt because um as things melted branches shifted and started to fall again so we're still cleaning up we actually left the last people got power i guess yesterday and we left the state of emergency last night or something at like midnight so it's it's it's not fun just hearing what it does to the lawn i hate to even guess what the road conditions would be like in something like that strangely enough the roads weren't that the the roads themselves were okay um there wasn't given that um sort of things hit and and for some reason i don't i don't quite understand why they maybe the ice didn't have anything to grab onto the roads themselves weren't weren't like covered in a solid sheet of ice things seemed to be okay um especially given that you know the next day it was forty degrees um you know everything started to melt and then the roads themselves icewise were okay it was just that um there were there were power lines down everywhere on the road and there were trees downed everywhere and wherever you drove was sort of like driving through an obstacle course you didn't want to have to wind up hitting um you know hitting a tree or hitting a power line or hitting a phone line or anything else that was the rough part of it they closed school for kids for like a week just just because of that so sounds like the aftermath of like a hurricane down here yeah that's what i'm actually told i've i've never experienced a hurricane well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting torn completely off the poles being completely pulled out of the ground oh God yeah well i guess um but typically it down there though you don't get much coldness right you get we get maybe all winter long we might end up with twenty five days of really cold weather and of those by the time it gets lunch time as as long as the wind's not blowing it's bearable how well when you say cold what do you mean by cold uh i think of any thirty five and below as cold oh sheesh yeah um um it's right about now when they're talking about hitting thirty five and forty degree days we're thinking heat wave because occasionally what'll what'll happen here is with the wind chill it can go below zero quite often which is not not fun i personally hate it i'm only here for school another thing that saves us during the winter time is if we get a breeze coming straight off the Gulf the wind chill factor blows everything out of proportion uh most of the time during the winter that we've got an offshore wind which is blowing straight out uh so you don't get the wind chill there that's nice that's nice uh i uh my my goal is to move some place south so that i don't have to worry about winters any more and just worry about you know an occasional thirty five degree day i can handle but the the the sad part about here is that winter starts in um in you know early September or September October and then it ends in March or April so there isn't that much summer and spring and fall here it's pretty much you know lots of winter and uh it's a very long winter semicold winter and a very gray winter usually so not uh not fun trying to think where's the warmest the warm lines start i guess probably if you're drawing a line across a map of the country put the middle of your ruler on Dallas is it that low you think uh they get snow up there but it's it's not a long lasting snow it'll be there they may have a week of it then it warms back up into the high thirties and forties um that's not too bad you get much above you get much above the Texas border on in that sector sector of the map and get up into Oklahoma they've got a little bit longer winter they're catching yeah all the cold breezes coming straight off the Rockies straight across Kansas and Nebraska and there's nothing the only thing that stands between Oklahoma and Kansas and Nebraska there's a barb wire fence somewhere around Topeka that's the only thing to slow down the wind a little barb wire fence huh well i've only been out uh i've only been in the west once so uh i was i was in Iowa and it was bitter cold when i was there and that's the way that's north um that's sort of north midwest though so way way north of where you are so i i uh my experience wasn't wasn't quite down there i i i like i said i want to wind up somewhere down in that range where it's nice and warm and you know when when when you get twenty five cold days a year rather than twenty five warm days a year which is what we wind up with  hi Carol hi Frank how do you feel about uh lawn and garden work uh well to tell you the truth my husband does most of the work yeah i feel real good about it so you feel good about it what kind of a system does he have does he have a power mower or a riding mower yeah no he has a um you know um a push mower i mean it's electric of course um i i think it's not very old about um not that old three or four years old maybe and uh he he really enjoys it so so you let him enjoy it yeah that's fine you don't feel you don't feel guilty about it no well last uh no i do enough other things i don't feel guilty about that last year this is i'm almost ashamed to admit it but last year for the very first time i did mow the grass my first time in my whole life oh and uh that wasn't too bad i it was good exercise it's a it's a push mower though well you know it's electric of course i mean it's a power a power mower it it's it's pretty powerful oh yeah yeah but it's it's power power but you have to push it i've uh i've got to admit that the last two lawn mowers that i've gotten um were uh power driven um-hum they're they're uh you know they're gasoline and they have a mechanical contraption on it you pull the handle and it pulls the lawn mower for you um it takes me about an hour to do to to do my lawn that's about the same for ours and uh well if you if you got got him a power mower it'd probably take him a lot less time to do it but i enjoy doing it i feel good doing it uh i i feel a lot better doing it with a power mower with that with a with a pull tractor on it so i don't have to push so hard yeah but uh i enjoy going and cutting the grass i like the way it looks and uh i also have other other garden equipment like uh weed whacker or the trimmer to go around all of the the uh fence and everything oh yeah uh-huh does he have those as well oh yes um let's see we've got a weed whacker we have an uh edger you know that goes between the grass and the sidewalk oh this this comes with the blade on it you mean uh-huh um right um is that a power mower or is that a power edger or is it a that one is electric so he's got to plug that in and drag the cord around oh and let's see um hedge clippers you know electric of course hedge hedge clippers yeah um i think that's all of the power tools we have we um but that's that's i think that's about all they make how often does he do it oh once a week um actually though um we just moved all right to uh Texas a year and a half ago uh-huh and they have a new uh system that they're trying to promote here which is uh they don't bag it as they call it um yeah essentially you know cutting it um probably more like every four or five days and so it's still short enough so that you can mulch it back into the grass and never bag it for one thing um cuts down on waste for landfills and all of that uh-huh so so the state is encouraging you to do that um it's actually through the County Extension Service uh-huh and they put out all kinds of information on it and then they put up uh they had a few lawns in the area that were like uh samples and they put a big sign in their yard that said you know this is a don't bag it lawn and let you watch and see how they did it so their grass clippings were never bagged they just mulch back into the grass itself and acted as a fertilizer do they do something to the lawn mower to to help it uh stay inside or they yeah as a matter of fact and our lawn mower does that too it's you you shut off the where the bag would go or where it would you know spray out the side uh-huh yeah so that it just mulches underneath it just goes back down um right underneath the blade but they don't they they they have special munching mulching uh mowers but that's not one of them right no that's no that's not it's not necessary to have that nope it is not oh i always thought that it was but you you you have to but you're you're right though in that you do have to cut it though when it's um relatively short you can't let it go a week or two because if the clippings are that long then they'll just lay on top yeah they have to be short enough that they'll still fall back down um into the grass oh that's interesting maybe there's something i can try this time around it takes takes him a lot less time because even though he does have to do it every four or five days um since he doesn't have to bag all of those clippings you know it rather than taking i don't know as an example an hour and a half to do the whole lawn it only takes an hour huh so you know plus less bags less waste does he have the lawn treated um we tried that but we really weren't happy with it so he does that all himself now oh well i um i tried it about ten years ago and i've been doing it ever since i've been having it treated yeah and it makes it grow much faster uh our season though in New England uh is is only three months or so and then it starts getting cold again in September oh that's true so we don't have um i guess out in Dallas you must have a a longer season oh gee i'd i'd say our grass is getting green right now so i'm sure he'll in fact he may have already cut it once i can't remember no kidding no kidding um but it'll be yeah we'll have to start cutting real soon wow and uh then oh well in on into October November i'm sure oh we i i don't go that uh that deep it starts getting cold when as soon as the cold weather comes it stunts the growth of the uh the grass right i know in the summer time i've got to uh i've got to hold actually hold it as long as i can uh as long as i can make the grass i can't cut it i think it's the recommended three three and a half inches they want me to leave it so i can cut it let it get that long wow well in the summer time so that the heat doesn't uh burn the grass right and they recommend that i keep the blade very high s o because it's that high i have to do it frequently as well i try to do it every uh uh six or seven days if what kind of grass do you have um i really i've got a mixture i guess uh-huh it's all different kinds but if i let it grow too long if i let it go like a week and a half two weeks then it starts seeding on me right and that's it gets too long and then it uh starts bunching up underneath the lawn mower and i can't get it out and and it's uh it it turns out to be a real mess so i've got to do it uh uh no later than once a week right and i uh i don't block off my my uh chute but i don't pick up my grass either i leave it on the lawn and uh i try to go over it again i do pick up or i rake up uh um-hum you know the clumps that uh that occur but i try to leave it down there right i did pick up uh a lawn sweeper oh really we don't have one of those yeah that's kind of that's kind of like uh the old-fashioned carpet sweeper only it's it's wide and you put it on your grass and what it does is it sweeps the lawn and it only picks up uh-huh oh you know the height that you you set it at so i set it very high and it just picks or it skims the grass it doesn't dig way down deep so i don't have a lot of grass that i uh that i collect does it work for leaves oh yeah works very good with leaves because leaves typically if you pick them up right away uh they'll sit on top of the grass oh right and uh i'm trying to find a way how to uh electrify it or motorize it because of this i have to push but it uh it's it's wide enough to pick up uh like the width two widths of a lawn mower oh well so you can do it relatively quickly oh yeah well that's sounds interesting we uh we don't well i don't know if we do that very much i think i remember my mom had one of those i i try to take the the clippings and uh i don't know put them in a mulching not a mulching but uh to let them decompose right i think that is mulching uh what do they call that a compost pile right compost pile i haven't been very successful i'm on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesn't decompose i guess i got it's not composting you supposed to put chemicals on it i don't think so no i think it's supposed to be natural no it's it's not working oh well it's getting it's shrinking down it's getting small but it uh it's still grass it's it's dried up grass and it it just stays there it doesn't turn into dirt i think you're supposed to turn it every once in a while what air it out well i think it it on the inside is where it the chemicals you know it starts to break down uh-huh and i think if you're supposed to turn it huh i mean not not very often but you know go in and and stir it up so to speak to get the yeah stuff on the outside in to the inside i'm going to have to try and do that it might help i don't know maybe it'll work yeah uh the other thing i was thinking of doing is getting some chemicals to try and help the process up uh a little more a little faster i don't know i i i think the idea is supposed to be natural so that you know there's no chemicals no chemicals in it no chemicals and plus then you can use it as a fertilizer and not have to worry about spreading those chemicals like on your lawn or your bushes or whatever yeah i um i'm seriously thinking of discontinuing the chemical service because of the uh um i guess what i didn't realize was that that they're actually putting poisons on my grass uh-huh and it wasn't until uh a year or two ago where the state required anyone putting chemicals on lawns that they tell the the customers what they're actually putting on the lawn and what the uh the hazards are and uh my children are all grown up now but when they were younger i was fertilizing my grass and didn't realize that some of the the chemicals that are on the grass that are being put on by the chemical companies um stay there longer than than than a few hours and they're playing on they were playing on it and yeah and my uh dog was out there playing in the grass and they were playing in the grass so i don't what long term effects that they uh the chemicals sure had on the grass but that's bothered me to the point where i'm thinking thinking about discontinuing it this year yeah and try to get more uh  Cindy have you seen Dances With Wolves no i haven't have you oh that is a wonderful movie uh-huh it's not the length isn't too long no oh goodness no you don't even you don't even realize it you know uh-huh oh well really i've heard different opinions about it uh uh-huh one that you know yeah it was too long and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end and it didn't and it kept going on and uh-huh really oh i thought it was great yeah really now i've seen you know some different clips of it um and it it looks good it's just i haven't had the time to go to the movies lately well yeah and i heard a story about there's a there's a certain scene in the movie where there's um where they're where they're on a buffalo hunt and they have a particular child actor uh who's who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo uh-huh uh-huh and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo i can't remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for Oreo cookies uh-huh uh-huh oh and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with Oreo cookies hey that'd work for me let me tell you i thought that was really funny uh-huh uh-huh now i've seen another clip of um the guy that plays in Murphy Brown i don't know his name but he's he played the uh the the character in it that was very like gross i mean very dirty and oh i saw the one clip of him and ugh it when he was first i guess he was taking Kevin Costner to oh yeah like the site where he was going to be or whatever oh yeah that was rather um gross yeah the wagon the wagon driver yeah yeah but other than that i've heard the the you know the um the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful yeah and uh the costuming uh-huh really yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things oh really and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh the styles uh-huh of the actual stuff but they didn't they didn't age it uh-huh quite enough it seemed but it was a very good movie uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well i guess i will have to see it then what have you seen lately um actually have been to the movies um i think the last movie i saw was Misery oh i didn't see that oh very suspenseful i don't i don't like Stephen King i really don't either but i went with someone and once i was there i couldn't believe i mean it's an excellent movie yeah really i wasn't sure because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i i just don't want to have anything to do with it it's not necessarily it it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful i mean it's not yeah i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know no in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet um she she breaks both of his ankles hum ugh and that i couldn't watch and but you know you could tell when it was coming yeah so yeah um that was so that he couldn't leave her cause she it still just seems a little twisted to me i'm not sure i would have enjoyed that at all yeah yeah i mean uh yeah well as far as that goes yeah i mean you wouldn't like to see anybody anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions yeah and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer and it was just uh-huh but she was a killer and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that yeah oh yeah so but so yeah we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately i know we don't see movies at the movies a lot the last we did go see Dances With Wolves and we went to see Not Without My Daughter but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them uh-huh uh-huh oh right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy oh yeah that looks really good too um that yeah it looks good and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time now see i and Silence of the Lambs i'm i'm intrigued by it but i'm not sure i want to go see it yet yeah i don't think i want to see that either i know i don't i don't think i could i think well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren't the main aspects really really uh-huh know now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so it's it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um oh well i liked that movie yeah uh-huh strange in other ways uh-huh hum well i guess that's about it okay it was nice okay it was nice talking to you bye-bye maybe we'll talk to you again alright bye-bye  okay all right last thing i saw was um i think uh Sleeping With the Enemy with Julia Roberts oh i hadn't seen that but i've heard that it's real good my husband didn't like it that much i thought it was okay it was a little strange you know this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly you know she fakes her death kind of thing and he tracks her down uh-huh oh so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he's in the house you know after her but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh why didn't she just tell him to straighten up you know why didn't she just tell him hey look bucko you don't get away with this nonsense yeah oh but anyhow um what have you seen well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies we went to see Awakenings uh-huh um with Robin Williams and we went to see Kindergarten Cop uh-huh yeah and i really liked both of them i really did Awakening was it was kind of sad to me it really was and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really don't know that much about it uh-huh so this is where the people have been kind of well i don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time and the drugs let them come back yeah yeah yeah uh-huh but the drugs didn't work for long and they started having real bad side effects oh and this is about nineteen sixty four i believe or something like that and there still hasn't been any you know new development in prescribed drugs that can help it um but yeah there you know it it was a big breakthrough but in time you know the all the side effects started showing well how bad were the side effects bad oh yeah yeah they was actually went back like they were you know oh um yeah all it was they wasn't mild you know they was just bad side effects um but i really enjoyed it though um you know well how about Kindergarten Cop oh yeah that's strictly for entertainment that was just it was you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know at first he was just a big muscle man but he's kind of branching out yeah he sure is he is as a matter of fact um Sylvester Stallone is that his name Sylvester Stallone is that his name i really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good uh-huh you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher um it was really good well there was a movie out it's been on cable i get cable and there's this thing with uh Danny De Vito called Twins oh i've seen that yes i thought that was just great it is it is isn't it yes yes i even like some i mean some of the original stuff like i like The Terminator at first you know it was kind of strange but i still like watching him in The Terminator and and some of the other things um yeah uh-huh Total Recall last year i thought was really good last summer oh yeah yeah guess it didn't last too long at the box office but i thought it was pretty good yeah i did too i really did and it was i enjoy a lot of movies now as far as let's say heavy violence i can't handle um i'm not into that you know i just like Rambo and all that um i that's just something i just don't want to watch yeah yeah and i i have some one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks oh and i just keep telling her how can you do that and i told her when she had her her little girl i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those you shouldn't be watching them with your little girl and she says her little girl's into it now oh my goodness and she watches she watches these really gross things you know like The Nightmare on Elm Street and the you know that kind of junk i don't go for that at all yes oh uh-huh yeah oh i guess i'm a little too scary for that i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie and it was like this house big house had a basement and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years oh uh-huh you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie yes yes yes you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff and it's true i i had a lot of things that i i nobody told me that it was all fake i was just sitting there watching it going oh jeez it is it really is yes watching yeah watching yes oh i don't want to go home yes yes oh goodness but i think a lot of kids it's funny get the same kind of fears like there's somebody under the bed yes oh where do we get that from yes i know uh i have two children i really try to watch what they watch i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know he'll come in mama i think the ghost is in the house mama i hear it um don't you how old are they they're eight and ten so they're you know they hadn't really distinguished it's just a movie you know i try to say it's just a movie but no mama i've seen it oh but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten and we rented Charlotte's Web okay oh uh-huh and he just bawled at the end and just uh she's not going to die and we were trying to say Kenny it's okay and he didn't want to listen to it oh oh oh he just was beside himself you know this is supposed to be a nice children's movie Charlotte's Web he just couldn't stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end die oh oh it's funny how your little minds work isn't it oh oh yeah she's so nice she can't die oh it was just oh oh i guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars people like us you know oh oh goodness well well i've enjoyed talking to you you too and maybe we'll run across each other again yeah this is kind of neat i haven't ever initiated a call i've just been called you know by the switchboard and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it but i normally get a call like every other day do you well as far as we could not call in last week um you know from where i'm at uh-huh we couldn't call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls um how weird i don't know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution oh uh-huh oh it was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures i was going oh well yes oh oh well my husband sometimes you know he'll receive a call and he's at work uh-huh and if i you know if i know the topic i'll go ahead and accept it as mine but the other day i got one about fishing and i thought oh my i don't know a thing about fishing so i'm not even going to try because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time believe me say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water but i'm really not for sure though if well i'll let you go and we'll talk to you later okay bye-bye alrighty bye-bye  okeydoke okay down here it's been it's everybody's got colds and everything because it's cold one day and hot the next day really oh that's the way it is up here like today it was fifty and raining and two days ago it was snowing a blizzard up here so it just it just likes kind of crazy all over the country i guess it's just yep yeah well it is it's about yeah it's about seventy five here today it's seventy five down there yeah that's not too hard to take yeah no but uh couple of days ago it was in uh mid uh thirties at night and only warmed up to about forty five in the daytime yeah uh-huh well it does that up here well we get a lot of weather that's that's uh controlled by the ocean we're so we're so close to the ocean here in Rhode Island are you familiar with with Attleboro at all or in Massachusetts yeah yeah not not uh no not the uh the area you know i am the TI plant as far as you know what they make and everything but the weather no okay okay well New England is kind of kind of like uh pretty close sits right on the Atlantic Ocean and we get you know a lot of a lot of the weather is driven by the winds coming in off the ocean the northeast winds bring in yeah yeah all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes we'll get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know yeah yeah well down here they're normally Dallas normally has pretty good weather but uh but yeah it it's not bad uh i i was i was in Abilene for ten years i worked in Abilene for ten years so yeah i'm kind of familiar with the weather out that way in west Texas but not in not in Lewisville yeah but uh also the pollen down here has been terrible if if you've got sinuses if you're bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that other stuff that gets in the air boy it's just been driving everybody crazy is that right everybody everybody's sick down there yeah uh either sinus problems or like i say colds or flu or whatever of course i don't know that that's really really weather related i think you know we just have have every once in a while have epidemics of uh-huh of viruses going around i know i had strep throat here about a week ago week and a half ago well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctor's visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it yeah yeah you're absolutely right you don't know how to dress you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because it's real cold and by noontime you're taking everything off you know to to go walk around the site and stuff yeah yeah and and it's unreal that uh uh you know by evening you can drop back twenty thirty degrees it's just the weather changes so quick you know yeah yeah and if you don't have coats and sweaters with you of course by then you're all sweated up and warm and that's how i think a lot folks carry yeah well i'm a hot weather person i'm i can take the heat but i don't like the cold yeah my the older i get the less i like the cold up here i'll tell you i think that i think that uh you know it just takes it's toll and uh and uh yeah that yeah when you get when you're young you kind of can tolerate a lot of a lot of cold weather and stuff yeah that snow is pretty to look at but i i don't like to drive in it or or you're right you're sure right it's it's nice to look at but the last couple of storms we've had the last couple of snowstorms we've had have really been good because they snowed and and like within a day it's warmed right back up and melted the roads and stuff so huh we're able to get around pretty good and it didn't stay too long on the sides of the roads but i spent uh i spent a year up in Colorado Springs at TI up in Colorado Springs uh oh i've uh-huh i guess you've seen some pretty weather up there too it was beautiful weather and it it was real strange it could snow yep and be sun shining or right after it got through snowing you could go out in short sleeved shirt and it wasn't that uncomfortable yeah uh-huh that's the way i found that's the way i found Abilene in the winter because of the yeah it's a it's a dry snow it's not a wet slushy snow it's packed yeah there's no see the humidity up here too is really bad in the summertime it's really bad it can be seventy five eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety ninety five percent and boy your just like you're in an oven roasting i'll tell you yeah yeah yeah but West Texas now was a hundred and ten and i didn't mind that at all you know because it was so dry no yeah and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California uh-huh out in the middle of the Mohave Desert yeah that's nice out through there i've got a and i loved that i've got a son lives in Riverside and i drove across the Mohave Desert went to Las Vegas i went from route five to Las Vegas by car and that was a pretty nice trip yeah yeah yeah but uh that was also a dry hot it wasn't a it wasn't a humidity hot and uh i enjoyed it i was surprised that last year was my first trip out there i'd never been to California and i went through out to Death Valley and yeah it was like a hundred and twenty five or something and it it didn't feel that hot yeah no huh-uh especially it it like strange that it you're right in the middle of the mountains and it's so brown and dry but boy you just didn't feel right yeah it didn't feel that hot especially if you can get find some shade uh-huh yeah that's the hard thing out that way but uh i liked Riverside though the weather in Riverside was pretty good in California was it was i have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona so yeah yeah that was pretty good but the weather here in New England like like they say if you don't like it too well well just stick around a little bit and and it it will change up and give you something that you may like worse or like more it all depends on on Mother Nature's kind of fickle up this way i guess it will change yeah they had a they had a interesting show in uh public channel down here yesterday on uh the uh ice flows and the ice age and how the weather effected the ice ages and everything and it's real interesting uh-huh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this that's what we get real cold weather where the wind blows down out of Canada is called that uh Canadian ex press and boy that winds comes down and it and it seems to make a big dip yeah yeah sometimes it dips all the way down to you folks down in Texas and then it roars back up the east coast here by the time we get it it is hauling some cold weather yeah yeah in fact i think they showed on the they showed the United States map a shores of course Canada or North America map and showed uh how far the ice had come down and during the last ice ice age yeah and i think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice boy that's unreal when you think about it you know that's that must be something uh to yeah well they say these big icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic then you see the tip of them they look like small mountains and that's only like one third of the iceberg the rest of it submerged under the water yeah right right and that's been uh uh a problem you know to to the merchant people that that fish and stuff up here they run into that ice stuff in the winter and it breaks away how long have you been up there in uh Attleboro Attleboro i've lived here all my life and i worked uh i've been with uh TI fifteen years ten of it in in Texas five years up here yeah but i've lived up here all my life and i'm fifty eight years old so i i could well my wife spent some time up in Connecticut yeah that's right next door to us Connecticut's not that far away did she like it up here in Connecticut yeah yeah yeah she liked it and she wants to go back up there and and uh look around you know just sight see it's nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because that's that's something that you just can't paint a picture of or yeah yeah and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors yeah and uh that that's really nice to look at uh the summers are hot pardon me what do you all have aspen you all have mostly aspen or no we have a lot of maple up here and oak mostly oak and maple is is a and and pine of course evergreens up as you get up north into the northern part of the maple the eastern corner here it's all pine trees and yeah but uh i guess the hardwoods are probably the biggest thing we have are our hard maple and hard oak and and the the evergreens yeah well but that's scattered with birch trees and stuff and uh it's real pretty when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors and people come from all over the world come through New England only like that week or two when the colors are the brightest you know yeah a lot of our trees and things now are are starting to bud out i sure hope we i sure hope we don't get a hard freeze to to kill everything now oh sure because it's so warm yeah uh-huh but well uh yeah the it it's kind of one more week here i guess and we'll be into uh into the springtime i guess we got another week of winter here just about right we'll be out of the out of the winter and into the springtime and yeah uh-huh yeah we might get one more little snowstorm in April but i don't think it will amount to much yeah usually down here our worst our worst month our coldest month is usually February but we didn't have have that much of a winter this year this that's what i noticed when i was there was the ice storms you got around February one time i flew into DFW and it was iced over we had to go into Love Field because we just couldn't get into DFW yeah yeah usually yeah i'm i'm kind of sorry that we haven't had a real good hard a long hard freeze we've had a you know we've had a freeze but just maybe one or two days yeah i think that that kills a lot of germs and stuff it it kills a lot of the bugs and the yep you're absolutely right i think it does it kills germs and bugs and the same thing up here if we get a hard hard freeze in the ground we get a lot of a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the spring but if we don't boy they just seem to jump right out yeah yeah and i'm afraid this summer is going to be bad as far as and bugs as fleas ticks and stuff like that yeah but uh how long have you been with TI uh uh thirty two years thirty two years boy that's a long time yeah yeah uh you working in the in the military equipment equipment uh DSEG yeah D S defense systems equipment group yeah yeah i was in that yeah uh-huh  here we go okay um have you ever been involved in any trials i sure was Two years ago i spent some Fourth of July to Labor Day on a jury that was uh a change of venue from Columbus Ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping wow yeah it was quite a session that disrupted disrupted my whole summer of course sounds like it five days a week but it was an absolutely fascinating experience oh it sounds like it i haven't had any actual real life experience but uh my father-in-law's been involved in uh several trials including uh a couple of murders and uh you know talking to other people who have been there and so i don't have any real experience with trials but i do you know i i've i took a little business law in in college and and i've you know try to keep abreast of things but uh uh-huh hm i think that the uh trial by jury is is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago hm right now though it's it's so difficult because there's so few courts to to get anything really done as you know you spent you know a whole summer on one trial uh-huh and it's just that i think they're just tying up the um whole judicial process um there's a lot of things they could do to uh make things easier and uh you know like uh the suggestion that uh maybe the uh a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury uh-huh well i think that there are many cases where uh the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury Our situation was somewhat different uh in view of the fact that uh we haven't we were a landmark case it was the first time in the state of Ohio that um D N A testing was entered as evidence um-hum and they were being the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a a mistrial of any kind uh the uh uh-huh uh the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process uh that we experienced That took one full week uh to get forty three people qualified to sit on the jury And then it was a matter of the selection of uh twelve people after that actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates jeez and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare if we were well if we were comfortable and uh things of that nature which made us feel good um-hum uh and we were sequestered but the makeup of the jury uh was truly a cross section of uh you might say a cross section of a country there was one other person besides myself we were the only ones that had ever been to college hm one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work uh-huh uh two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out looking for jobs yet um a couple of them were housewives who had never worked and then some are people who did work gee so we had quite a cross section of black white and women and men um-hum and uh it uh it was interesting just to listen to the rationale uh being proposed and the logic of some of the people uh it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind uh and i thought that that was a failing because uh from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything and and yet the judge said well um if you're taking notes you're missing something yeah and he was right there also but uh uh certainly um i think it depends upon how the judge handles the case yeah and if the criminal chooses to have a uh three panel judge uh a three judge panel i should say i think he can have that rather than trial by jury um-hum yes yes i agree uh would surprise me that uh when i was in Texas i had the uh displeasure of getting a uh traffic ticket uh-huh and um i went to court and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket you're kidding no and i thought my God talk about tying up things for for yes and money yes i mean that's extremely expensive i mean the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial i'm like God this is ridiculous yeah yeah i do think that that uh i do think the jury system works but i'd i also feel as you said that the original concept of the jury as it was originally setup uh back uh in a hundred years ago was fine but that it needs to be more refined for today's standard of living and the the uh level of education of them of so many people now um-hum uh by the same token we had um uh some people who wanted to had vacations planned and one man in particular had reservations made plane tickets made everything and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back and then he wasn't selected on the jury oh my God and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins and they had he had to go through all of that if in three days to get excused from that jury to be with his wife on the birth of the twins and uh you know some of it just seemed rather extreme yes i i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that uh you know people would get a fair trial and not have to go through this process yes right i mean some things are just so cut and dry um in the in you know the the level of evidence that they come up with now i mean you know when you start thinking about well they've got videotape and uh-huh and audio tapes and they've they've got you know they've got ways to nail people to the point where they they really shouldn't even be going to trial right well i guess he'd have to be careful whether with entrapment or some of those things yes but uh i don't i assume you have seen on television recently as probably the whole country has the beating of the man in Los Angeles that was horrible isn't that terrible And uh you know and that certainly uh cannot be said to be uh something that happens everywhere that it but the fact that it can happen that it probably does happen in many places it's it's horrendous and it's just a stroke of luck that someone was able to get it on tape and then uh to listen to the tape recording uh at the police station of the whole conversation afterwards yeah yes i know i mean i only heard portions of that but it's absolutely terrible and you know if you beat a dog like that they'll put you in jail yeah absolutely well we just had a case uh you know like up at the end of last year where one police officer it was on a drug raid uh was trying to extra extricate um a confession or information from a drug dealer and did so by placing a hot a hot iron on his chest his bare chest burned him jeez they wound up paying him uh the officer of course was fired but they paid the defendant uh three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman so uh as some of those things uh are absolutely horrendous and we do need an all an overhaul and we just need more discipline country wide it would then we'd need it on that yeah uh yes i i believe that too well it's been very nice talking with you well it's been nice talking with you yes and uh good luck on on some other calls okay thank you you do the same bye-bye uh-huh bye-bye  yes i saw Home Alone with some friends just a couple days ago i wanted to see it uh because it was uh much recommended uh for months and months and months and it was a a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in and i usually when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good uh-huh even if it's in a genre i don't like i figure well i should go see it because if this is you know the best of the genre and i should know about it or something like that and i usually come away thinking no i really don't like this show yeah right uh-huh yeah i uh i i i feel that way when movies are like blown up out of proportion you know usually people tell you how good they are and you always yeah you know end up with expectations too high or whatever yeah yeah right well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess Hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to uh-huh uh-huh fall short of of being really creative with a lot of things i mean here's the situation of this kid at home you know it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in yeah uh-huh right and yeah he did some clever things but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was it seems to me they could have done a lot more i mean you know basically basically stepping on things and yelling in pain and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used yeah yeah i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie because that's uh not really the way comedies are right now uh-huh you know a lot of the comedies are more like jokes and you know gags and stuff like that there's not as much slapstick anymore uh-huh uh-huh well i guess it was a uh a very successful movie financially so we may say more slapstick uh-huh yeah that well that's true it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie yeah it is it is and i guess you don't have to but you know if you look at oh have you ever seen any of the Jacques Teti Teti movies the French movies uh Teti it it excuse me no not really the last movie i saw i guess uh was uh uh the one about the the French the Frenchman that leaves and comes back and he's someone different um he's uh uh well it's about a man uh that uh leaves his home and comes back to his wife and his wife's all excited but the guy that comes back is not her original husband um but um Gear um i'm sure you've heard of it it was a very famous uh popular movie Norman Gray Norman Gear um no i'm not with you so far oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up i'll remember the name but uh anyway that was a French movie it was um that was the last one i saw downtown but i i live in DC well actually Falls Church Virginia outside the city uh-huh ha ha uh-huh and uh so a lot of times they the the the international films downtown oh yeah but uh so this uh French i guess are into the slapstick i guess so they would like Jerry Lewis yeah they have they have a long yes they like Jerry Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated American quote unquote sophisticated American record company but they have this one guy Jacques Teti that does slapstick comedy and there's something about it right that's so innovative you know he'll have trouble picking up his hat or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind or something but there's something about it that just it isn't just slapstick there's something about the human character in it oh uh-huh and that's what i find lacking in a lot of you know like Home Alone there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying to be tough and they s had a lot of human character there but when it was the real slapstick moments him versus the criminals kind of thing it just sort of lost the human element became purely a caricature right um-hum right does does that make since to you yeah uh-huh yeah i see what you're saying there is less character development rather just the the the funniness of the gag rather than yeah yeah did you go with kids though and how it fits with the character right did you go with kids excuse me did you take kids along no we went uh without the kids it's was a a night out ah away from the children oh i would have liked to have a kid with me i think preferably someone seven or eight just just to get a sense for you know how how it affected them oh oh especially to come home and you know if he didn't knock real loudly and clearly i would have gotten in trouble the next day i'm sure uh-huh yeah that that's true i i was thinking about that too i saw that um that's why i watched another silly movie um um with my my cousin was uh uh the one about the um the turtles oh Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles huh um-hum right yeah i saw that with my cousin just to see what you know what the kids are into um-hum and your cousin's a kid and that is yeah he's a little yeah he's anyway and that was just uh-huh excessively violent i was worried it's like golly if kids start imitating that yeah wasn't it amazing they'll knock each others blocks off yeah those yeah it was all bloodless and the good guys can get hit all day long and they have to shake it off they don't they don't you know get epileptic fits or anything from getting hit on the head uh-huh um-hum yeah right yeah it it's a little disturbing the violence in these films partly it mean it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book but on the other hand it makes it seem like uh-huh i i read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies don't have very realistic effects of the violence the violence can seem very realistic but the aftermath is usually not there right if you see people who are severely injured it's very very badly they lose control of body functions they thrash around they scream you know uh it's just a very very bad thing and they never present that even the movies that want to show violence as real they don't really show you what happens with that real violence uh-huh uh-huh and i'm not really sure how i feel about that um-hum uh on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning on the other hand i wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee now we want to see the aftermath all the time either yeah right uh-huh yeah it's true but yeah Teenage Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is sort of the same way they i guess they figured i mean they know what they're doing and they make the movies good enough i guess i'm a bit of a snob they make the movies good enough to be successful yeah uh-huh and then they don't and they but they could make them better you know they could try to make i mean as far as i was concerned Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles could have been a classic of world theater uh-huh really it could have been you know it was it was innovative uh a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable cause the the story was stupid and and then things like that and uh they built up i remember feeling annoyed again i didn't have a kid with me and i remember feeling annoyed that they had this whole thing about the master and the passing of wisdom the from older to younger generation it was it was a classic Greek you know it's European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with uh-huh um and he had to past and he told them remember remember you united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that yeah right oh they didn't fight together they fought individually and they failed individually and then that was it then they had to have the master beat him right and the master should according to the classic myth the sort of Joseph Campbell type myth the master should have died at the end because the the lesson was passed to the young generation and the older generation is not needed and is reborn to the younger generation and on and on and on and all this wonderful myth right uh-huh and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that i anyway as an as intellectual adult would appreciate it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that and it would have make it uh broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for i thought but i um i'm i'm clearly enough you know i'm i'm clearly an intellectual snob to be going to these kinds of movies i realize that uh-huh i mean to go to these movies and expect them to be you know other than just just good entertainment kind of thing right that's true yeah there's not too many that are uh that are good just on their you know that that you wouldn't want to change something and there's always something that uh yeah yeah i i i i'm very i'm very critical i i i'm actually originally from Hollywood and then then then and my father works in films and such and i tend to um-hum oh really tend to be hypercritical of these things and then perhaps perhaps it's unfair because i i i must admit i enjoy these movies um uh-huh yeah right and that that's what they're for but i don't don't remember them and i think it's i think i can think of movies i have less fun during and then after the movie's over i remember it so terribly well because it it had some some meaning to me or something uh-huh right exactly yeah there there there are a couple movies that hit home like that most of the ones i always remember are the the older ones um-hum i always like the musicals and uh those ones uh those stick in your head yeah yeah they leave the yeah they leave they leave some songs with you they leave i don't know what it is uh-huh but it just i mean i don't know if this is old fart talking here or something because i'm not that old i look you know those old movies seemed to have had something that uh that was memorable somehow i don't know what it was no it could be uh-huh um okay well i guess i got to get going got to go take care of the children okay well um thanks for hearing me ramp i guess all right nice talking with you yeah nice talking with you are you calling from Texas by the way okay no i'm in California oh okay the first person i've talked to outside of Texas so they're paying the phone bill yeah there must be Texas people as near as i can tell no okay i'm from the other coast all right bye bye yeah okay well thank you very much bye bye  well the roles of women have certainly changed over the last uh decade or two and i wonder if the the stresses that it puts on the the woman's body is uh all that good for her as it were had had there been enough adjustments in society to help the woman cope with what she has to go through um support group wise or or just all the different aspects that men have developed over the years to handle what the world does to them uh how how is the woman's world coming along in that respect i think it's come along very slowly i think that uh a lot of the stresses that you talk about have have have taken a long time to become recognized but more strides are made toward addressing those stresses in women than ever were in men and i think that you know women have had stress you know for the last two hundred years but it's been a different kind of stress different kinds of situations because just being in the work place is different from being at home but at home you still have work to do you still have things to take care of but you don't have the responsibilities and the pressures that you have in the work place so a lot of women have a little bit of trouble adjusting to that but i feel like the in in the last couple of decades the the roles have almost come full circle because you know early on people were wanting to we were wanting to stay home with the kids and then they got into everybody has to have a career and it seems to be going back to a lot of women wanting to stay home with their kids although i don't think it'll ever go back to the way it used to be there will still be many many women who seek careers uh before they seek family do you think a matter of choice or economics both both i think it's it's a matter of both um economics economics has a lot to do with it unfortunately but uh i think a lot of choice has gone into it lately and and most of them or or a lot of women i know would rather uh-huh um if they have children they would rather stay home with them if if they if they possible can yeah that's true you know that's an interesting point that you brought up about the the fact that they essentially always have been under stress uh i would say more in the later latter years even those who stayed home had stress but when you're the one or the two out of ten women staying home on the block uh then the stresses that you do have uh the normal day-to-day stresses caring for children or whatever is occurring uh-huh uh you could go to at one time one era you could go to the other dozens of wives on the block or you could meet for tea or whatever and you had that stress relief uh built in yeah your neighbors that's true uh whereas now with it's a kind of fifty fifty split or leaning whatever percentage happens to be in your neighborhood like for our neighborhood we're looking at ninety percent working women let's say uh there's no place for the wife to go when she has uh those kind of of stresses to be relieved yeah right there's no one for her to go talk to and there's also no one to to kind of come in and take over for her and allow her some time to herself for even a day you know because there's fewer and fewer people left or women that left at home to do that so that's right about two months ago Omni Magazine which is a a science magazine are you familiar with that read an article um really restating some conclusions of some some uh um-hum yeah programs or some investigations or research whatever you want to call it into the the actual physical differences between men and women and questioning whether those physical differences uh accounted for some of the differences in ways women handled stress as opposed to men and i guess to just barely summarize what the article said was that in the the womb the differing levels of testosterone and estrogen across the lower part of the brain the base of the brain affected essentially how the brain was connected to the rest of the body um-hum uh now how that has to deal with stress i'm not really sure since i thought most of the stress had to do with you know from the from the eyes and the mental processes on up i don't know what it would have to do with the connectivity to the rest of the body hum yeah but it was an interesting uh uh line of reasoning where we've always thought or been told especially by the for lack of a better term women's libber you know we're just the same as men well maybe not and and maybe you shouldn't be exposed to the stress the same way that men have right right have managed to do all these years and maybe it will take a lot longer before the physical physical evolution or for lack of a better term will occur to allow you to handle what we've put ourselves through yeah i agree with that i it it's something that um you know i guess science will eventually have all the answers to everything i don't know but it seems like it it would really be it's it's really difficult to put two person a male and a female in the same role in the same circumstances and have them react to have them and their bodies react to the same situation in similar similar ways i think you know even between a same sexes in a different in the same role there would there would be differences in the way one guy handled something over the way another guy would handle it so i i think when you put a male and a female in right in and when in comparison you know it would be uh completely different i mean just just totally different and it you know goes a lot of it goes back to the way you were raised as children you know the males are raised to believe this and be this way and the females are raised to believe something else and be this way and uh when when you're raised that way you you kind of perpetuate that oh those ideals that other people uh force upon you right and so you don't you're not able to well i i guess you are able to if you want to change them but you you stay in those roles for so long that it's it's hard to to adjust and it would take a a really long time for ethnic science to figure out you know what affects women how and how the same thing affects men i think it i just don't think it's any kind of study they can do in any even twenty or thirty year period of time you know yeah the subject would die before they had to run all the tests that they need that's it would be an exhausted test uh how about the the area of role models or roles as it were when you that's right it would you know teach the boy that uh he fixes the car and the woman fixes the meal uh not not arguing that there should be a role for a sex but should there be uh a set of not not a specific role let's say let's not say that only the the girls should do the cooking but at any given generation or for any given uh-huh uh compatibility if you want a couple to be together shouldn't they have uh defined roles as it were uh certainly capable of sharing the other role for nothing more than empathy i mean it you know at least they understand what the other person is going through right uh not being a tremendous cook i i know what the burden of preparing a meal but i don't know what it would have taken to make that meal taste any better out on the budget i give her that kind of deal yeah so i i wonder i don't have any argument or any problem with women changing a given role as long as there's something on the other side let's say of of any relationship to uh-huh to match that i mean you don't want two people doing the same thing in the relationship to pick up the slack yeah that's right yeah yeah you have to it has to balance out so and i guess that's when you get into relationships and people people are attracted to people who compliment them most often i mean they say opposites attract and i'm not too sure i believe that very much but uh i think that people when they get into relationships you know if there's somebody who like like if you got two people who hate to cook they're going to eat out all the time and that you know that's not that big a deal but you know if you get somebody who likes to cook and someone who doesn't like to cook then the person who doesn't who doesn't like to cook probably likes to do something else you know so i think that people end up i think that that women are more diverse now than they ever were as far as what they have learned and what they're capable of and and uh what they're willing to do and so i feel like it you know that men have gotten to be that way too they've gotten a little bit more relaxed in their thinking about uh women and you know what they expect of them so i think that you know it's a slow evolution but i think it's it's it's a good process i think it's it's working you know there are still people who men who believe that women should be home you know all day uh-huh and cooking dinner my husband's in the kitchen cooking dinner saying right on right on yeah i i i know one that's still that way but that's about it i'm down to one friend that holds that position still i'm the only one home right now and i i have the kids clamoring for my attention now so i understand what that's like yeah yes so i i you know think that there are very few men who still feel that way and very few women who will tolerate a man who feels that way now that's an interesting point yeah i mean once the expectations are  uh being a former drug user whoa i uh i'd i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it uh-huh uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee uh-huh and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it's assets and uh and but you're also under their liability under the Workmen's Comp uh-huh uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen's Comp cases and where do you work uh i work for a tire company Modern Tire and uh it's also a retreading plant and that's where most of our uh injuries occur oh uh-huh and what we do is we'll have a drug test if if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then he's automatically uh given a drug trest right do they do it like you know within hours of the accident or is it yes when he goes to the doctor the first time yeah and so that kind of uh i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so uh-huh yeah now we've let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don't know how TEC would handle it they haven't pursued it you know uh-huh uh if there's some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative yeah so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know huh yeah yeah i think that's probably true too that's that's that's sort of scary uh-huh really and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know yeah yeah yeah really really yeah yeah that's that's a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should um-hum yeah uh-huh i'm a TI employee and and and uh i'm i'm really gung ho for it in fact uh-huh i you know some of the places now um like IBM don't allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we we have designated smoking areas uh-huh right yeah but um i work in sort of a building that's that's not really it well it's on the campus of the TI facility but it's a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it's mainly it's a factory environment uh-huh and uh they they have designated smoking but it's just wide open it's not ventilated properly and i think that's bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way yeah uh-huh uh-huh i think it's a it's a definite i think it's essential yeah because you're endangering everybody's lives if you've if it's something like that yeah in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and uh uh-huh i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know then finally the day we declared war was my time you're kidding no and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group the executives right right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first the executives but uh-huh yeah wouldn't that be awful if you were which i thought was interesting if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything oh man yeah ooh yeah i can't believe i'd was so brazen before i'm like i say i'm a former drug user but uh i i uh-huh well uh i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i don't use drugs any more what kind of drugs did you use if you don't mind uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines wow um yes uh-huh and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad really well it's really lucky that you got away from that cause that's really it's it's life is so much more enjoyable really downward spiral uh-huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know yeah yeah that's that's it i mean you know there's all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing yeah just life in general uh-huh that's right yeah well i'm well i'm definitely for it yeah plus you know you you want to think that that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share that's right but that are not endangering your life in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type oh goodness yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing yeah yeah and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals oh my gosh and that's really that's really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know yeah uh-huh on on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am right well i would think they would be well you well you'd think so but uh but they weren't i don't know if they do it until yet isn't that awful because when he was at course now it's been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at TI i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four uh-huh uh-huh eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever yeah huh so that's scary yeah that's reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he's the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff oh Lord oh and i just you know went oh where yeah should we move let me move as far away as possible ooh yeah that's awful but i'm proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and uh-huh yeah yeah they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know it's not smart so uh-huh yeah so i guess it was just a generational thing yeah peer group is the other way now instead of um-hum that's right and that's good that's the best way to stop it uh-huh that's yeah that it really is yeah well i think we did it okay well i enjoyed tack talking to you Cathy bye-bye it's good talking to you yeah bye-bye  well i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done uh-huh and the last time that um we tackled it i did the kitchen and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark it was called a sassafras it was kind of an orangish brown okay it was not real pretty anyway so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color yeah uh-huh i see i tried to cover it with white and it was quite a a feat getting that dark color covered and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets and know if i look underneath my cabinets i'm not satisfied with the jobs i i did on it because there're splotches yeah but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter yeah yeah that's for sure well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting process oh lord so uh the only uh i guess the the big discussion just kind of what you were mentioning has been the color we ended up with our our living and dining room are now uh kind of a a light peach color with uh and it's got all the old original hardwood trim and stuff so we've got the trim in kind of uh kind of an off-white and this is really the first uh interior painting project that i've attacked and it's it's been uh it's been something else to say the least we we had the same type of situation uh the walls were uh uh well they weren't the color difference wasn't so bad but uh there was semigloss underneath uh-huh and we put a flat over the top and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint oh yeah every time the sun would come up in the morning i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can but uh we've learned we're we uh we worked we've worked our way back into the hallway and and we're in the middle of the bathroom now but uh it's it's been quite an adventure the other the other thing that makes it uh a little more difficult we've got all hardwood floors and uh we we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since the since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth toothbrush and what not cleaning up so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried well it's it's not too bad it it uh the floors are finished with a polyurethane and it's really not to bad to get off it it we're just using latex and it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even it it it uh comes off with like a uh-huh a mild abrasive pad like a Scotchbrite pad or something like that and water and soap and water so we got pretty lucky on that and it's not scratching your floor because it's so thick oh that's pretty good we painted every room in this house some of them like two three times we have two children no not really but okay yeah and they just they ruin it's just terrible what they do and then i have been coloring my hair and i'm real haphazard when i do it so i've got dye on my bathroom door yeah oh gosh and i haven't figured out how to get that off i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good yeah yeah probably so and then we have a two story we did the outside of it one summer that was horrendous i mean i i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder i could get up on the roof and do that okay yeah yeah but i dread that the next time yeah i we uh our house was painted as part of the purchase contract so we didn't have to mess with that this time but i've i i grew up on a farm so i i've i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit uh but most of that it was done with a sprayer and uh up in the bucket of a loader tractor or something like that so it took a lot of the hassle out and then they're we're not you know you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a granary or something like that as you would be with your own house uh-huh no i wouldn't think so have you guys tackled your ceilings yet uh a little bit yeah yeah oh we got to do that this summer we're dreading it yeah it's like they're dark everything else is white yeah oh gosh yeah just just the opposite of what everybody's uh working towards now now have you thought about this that wherever you buy your paint you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business yeah yeah absolutely yeah we uh we stocked up the first time around but we've definitely got all the formulas on file and uh we're they'll be there for a while we're we're pretty comfortable with that but yeah it it i'm i'm real nervous every time i i open a new can i'm wondering if i shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all in a in a wash tub or something somewhere because i'm always i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match uh-huh but uh it's gone pretty well it just it it takes it takes some time my problem is while i'm not overly proud of it but i'm a self-proclaimed proclaimed perfectionist and it it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that and i'll find i'll find something as i'm going along something not related like like uh i've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because they they really didn't match they were a few of them were broken and things like that so i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this and and the painting actually takes probably uh a fourth of the time and i i'm always doing all this other stuff and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to to put in a ceiling fan or something strange like that so uh it it it always it it it gets you to look at everything real hard when you you start putting a coat of paint on everything you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere oh but i still feel good the minute i put that paint on even if it has got a dent in it i do yeah yeah it sure makes a difference oh what what else can i tell you about painting oh and i get it all in my hair too do you do that yeah spots in it yeah it's it's been uh we we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend you know spend a lot of time working on it and uh it was part you know part of the excitement was was getting a good deal on an older house it just it really hadn't been taken care of very well it it was actually it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that so we uh we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it but uh there just isn't enough time i i've i find myself going to work knowing that that there's a job about half done at home and i really if i would if i'd just stay home and finish it i'd feel a lot better but uh i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else so that you could once you get done you can always start over and and you make up all kinds of excuses so uh are you having to repair the walls at all uh not a whole lot it they're they're in pretty good condition um as as far as uh major repairs you know lot a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that but uh the only the most major things have been uh oh i guess i i moved a couple of outlets and or uh switches i should say they for some reason they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway and uh yeah and i i didn't like that very well so i i moved that but uh um that's smart most of it most of it's in pretty good shape so where do you live uh live in Dallas cause i'm in Garland okay okay could you try to call this weekend uh to that switchboard did you keep getting that it was down no no i haven't uh i hadn't tried in fact we were we were planting flowers this weekend so uh i was pretty tied up you didn't yeah but well i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house like to paint a picture or anything i don't know i can't think of anything else to say about painting uh-huh no that uh that's it hurts your back and it hurts your arm yeah you know it i get a sore i get a sore neck from looking up all the time yeah things like that but uh no that pretty much covers my experiences yeah but you're glad you're doing it right oh yeah most definitely it it just it makes such a difference like i like i say the the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much uh i you know i don't want to put a price on it but i just feel like we're every every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house you know every every time i do something a aside from that it just makes me feel a whole lot better to come home and you know old the walls are clean and they match and all those kinds of things uh-huh do you have one of those straight edge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards yeah yeah we do it uh it sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't it's i uh when i start doing trim i i've gotten to where i i tend to freehand it because there there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that uh it it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore and uh on your baseboards yeah yeah they you don't have any carpet down in your house no there's no carpet in the house right now see we've got carpet and i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it on down so that you won't see where you stopped off and still not get it on the carpet because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it um okay well you know um you can't hold it there until it's dried yeah i i've i've seen uh they're they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths and you can uh you can tape them together and and and put  okay so i guess um i start with maybe if if does do you know if the population favors statehood or what are we you were supposed to whether we favor it well i'm not i'm not sure what what the people of Puerto Rico feel uh how do you feel about uh the possibility of Puerto Rico becoming a state well see i have mixed feelings because um it it the with the financial situation i don't really quite understand what would happen there if they would be a burden to us or if they already are a burden so i i really what uh i really don't care you know i mean yeah well i question whether it's in their best interests to become a state right now they are a commonwealth and that means that they are under US protection in the event of uh defending their their country uh they do not have any voting privileges though and i don't believe they have any representation in Congress yes that i think that's true so that makes them feel definitely like outsiders but like getting back to the their government benefits they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits yeah i don't believe they have to pay any uh like federal tax uh yeah so um also of course they they can they join the they can always join the military service they are considered citizens i believe uh yeah i think they are they they do get uh privileges privileges like that yeah they can i'm not sure how much that uh carries on yeah that's a strange situation you you're a citizen yet you can't vote yeah so so if well i think we've got uh like a language barrier too i think most of the people there speak only Spanish i'm not sure how fluent they are in English and that's one of the major problems i i see with uh other countries as such being uh say the possibility of becoming states that we don't have a common language with them yes i went i worked um i went there for a class in a factory and some of the people in my class couldn't speak fluent English they had a very difficult time with it and they and they couldn't the ones that could speak speak it had a really hard time reading it so right i think we'd have the same type of problem say with Mexico uh Canada on the other hand uh English is one of their national languages they have yes as well as the the um the Quebec people that that speak French yeah uh-huh and they're supposed so i think they're they're supposed to be bilingual yeah but um i just see a lot of uh social and cultural differences that could uh pose problems with uh Puerto Rico becoming a state yes what do you what do you um do you do you think they should become independent maybe or do you think they should benefit um i don't think they're strong enough myself to become independent uh i think that it's in their best interest right now just uh to remain as is keep the status quo and uh keep uh stay under the United United States protection yeah i think if i was a middle class Puerto Rican maybe that that would be the um stablest thing to do yeah because i think that if they if they tried for independence they would probably have uh they would military factions that would oppose each other and and they would vie for leadership and uh the people who are well off there the middle upper class if there is such a thing uh they would probably be at a disadvantage losing possibility of losing their uh their assets or wealth yes so they've been talking about this for a long time do you think they're going to ever vote uh whether they want one one of the three choices i don't see it in the near future i know because i think i've been reading i read this ten years ago that they were having these big uh um rallies and people would be in the streets flashing signs statehood yes and other people would statehood down the statehood it's it down there if you're um familiar with their politics they uh it's very uh i i don't know it's called Latino there they have loudspeakers on their cars and they run down the neighborhood saying vote for you know Pierre he's or uh Pedro uh Pedro he's the best it's it's really kind of comical yeah well i've never been there i'm not quite familiar with with uh the way they do things yeah these these people they have the big loudspeakers because they have uh democratic system just like ours where they elect their mayors and their councilmens it's really kind of funny it's it's kind of an invasion of your privacy privacy too they're going down these streets with these really loud speakers uh-huh yeah oh i think that you know part of the biggest problem there is that they still really are third world country and they haven't uh caught up uh economically with uh say the United States yeah there there's some really poor areas where when i went uh it it looked like it was it was always you couldn't if you didn't know the area they they didn't advise you to go out and uh you know go in the the uh poorer sections of town but the the big cities where the uh big hotels were that that was that was safe ground to walk around but uh particularly in San Juan we wanted to go walk on the beach at night and they looked at us like we were crazy uh-huh says no you can't go at night because uh we were we our business was on the other side of the island we were only in San Juan it was at night okay they don't want us go out on the beach you know said it was very dangerous well did you have guides from the area or escorts or uh um actually we um met met some people that were in the naval base down there okay and uh they didn't particularly like living down there because it was very foreign very different the the people they they didn't treat them nice they you know um so i think there i what i learned from them there was a lot of resentment towards the Americans okay so and it was like they were they're Puerto Rican and were Americans right so that's why they're so um emotional about about statehood yet like you say it's they can't really support themselves so yeah well they've got that Latin blood they get fired up about every little thing anyway yeah that's very true i think one of the most interesting things about the possibility of uh attaining a fifty first state is what would we do about our flag how do you arrange fifty one stars what kind of pattern does do we come up with for that i don't know that that's a good one could have a contest yeah but the thing the thing that bothers me about it the most is they don't make decision they don't vote i i think if they voted that that as you say the um they they would probably stay commonwealth or that would be the best for them well that would give them them more of an interest in what goes on in this country if if they had uh uh a a uh a privilege of voting uh that would give them a vested interest in the government and uh i would see that as as a positive uh thing for them to consider yeah but as you say it's two different two different cultures i don't i don't know um so uh you like i say i was reading this ten years ago whether they could they're going to be talking about this in another ten years probably i don't see them doing anything uh yeah i really don't see any change in the near future so i don't know and it's also a long way away if you know if it was Cuba well Cuba's closer but uh yes Cuba's really close but uh Puerto Rica is uh is it's like uh i live in Vermont from Vermont to Florida it's another another uh what fourteen hundred miles across the ocean right but uh that is a good distance yeah and they have to they have to import a lot of their um cereals and things and and i don't understand now why they don't have a processing i guess it i uh they it's just as easy to bring the uh cereal in boxes as it is to bring it in in you know bulk grain and produce it there what is their major industry uh i really don't know um is it uh i i believe is it sugar cane or i'm not sure sure exactly what they do it could be i'm sure they rely heavily on tourism and even the all the American companies down there with their uh electronics industries and pharmaceuticals are big down there right okay that's one thing i did notice uh pharmaceuticals electronics that makes up i mean enough to be like eight or ten percent of their business but um i really don't know agriculturally they could have so much and they and they don't they don't seem to uh i don't know if i heard they don't feed themselves or not i don't think they support themselves agriculturally i found that to be really odd yeah i'm not very familiar with with the the state of their agriculture agriculture you know well they see they can't grow the grains i mean they're if the i guess their grains don't do well in the tropics so like you say they grow grow sugar beets and sugar cane and that's all export right you have to question you have to wonder how much tillable land they have uh being an island well yeah that is it's mountainous and uh but it uh-huh it looks fertile and it it um i mean it rains enough they have the climate and the rain and if not it's like i've been to Saint Thomas and it just starts from the ocean up uh-huh and it's and it's very it's like one big rock but uh Puerto Rico has lots of uh right lots of uh mountainous region and coastal regions yeah i know they must have a lot of tourism too but i don't see as much advertising there as you do in the Bahamas the say the Bahamas yeah i don't know uh i it with uh say uh uh Saint Thomas uh Virgin Islands uh places like that that's very true i don't know if they just take it for granted that they you know it's an American commonwealth they really don't have to advertise that much but that is an interesting point but i i believe it's a very popular vacation destination right well the Virgin Islands are an American territory yep and but you see a lot of advertising for that uh as far as uh vacation uh cruises and retirement  what what is do you have a favorite recipe okay okay um yeah that's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe well it says why would you what you would have for a dinner party um this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin oh okay maybe maybe we're all set okay we'll talk for five minutes they interrupt at the end um yeah it says what you would have for a dinner party i just happen to plan one out for Saturday i'll tell you what i'm going to have um oh that's wonderful okay i can find it well i have this new fondue pot and i was going to do basic cheese fondue and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham and i was going to try something weird which you know when you have fish au gratin i was going to make some uh like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue i don't know if it will come out that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or yeah the cheese fondue i make some people like Swiss um i prefer cheddar and i'll mix i won't make i won't have a sharp cheddar because for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp cheddar and then i was going to make other things like potato skins right yeah oh that sounds good it see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff and um i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a a vegetable that's always a good thing vegetable trays always go over so well because i think people get tired of eating junk i mean i think they like to have healthy stuff too you know it's oh yeah it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party oh definitely i think better even than than other kinds of food uh yeah instead of something greasy or right exactly yeah uh uh no um my uh girlfriend's do catering and they always about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray i think they try and suggest it um-hum what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something i make uh food kebabs You take little toothpicks and cut up uh pineapple and strawberry oh yes even banana if you can do it just before you leave it stays nice and fresh right right that's true or even have you ever seen where they they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat i beat yep yeah yeah i like those um they they made a couple of those uh they made one for my uh bridal shower and i was pretty pleased i never made one for myself though but they look easy enough to make it's not oh i think it would it would be a lot of work but um you know because it's you know you have to cut each thing or you know use the melon baler and stuff but but i think they're really neat and you know i think they're worth the time yeah yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water because they oh yeah right yeah yeah um something i do is a fruit is i'll get um make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them yeah i have two nieces and they they they go melt some chocolate chips go buy me some strawberries is that is that good you know i've seen that so many times strawberries dipped in chocolate but i've never tried it are they really good yeah they're you know if you get a sweet strawberry they're much better but if you get a sour strawberry oh i bet it doesn't mix well does it huh yeah no they um the strawberries are coming in season now from they're they're coming up from Florida of course i live in Vermont so but they're really reasonably priced they're coming up from Florida so oh well that's good because i know they've been really expensive lately because they weren't in season of course they had to be be uh grown in greenhouses and stuff and in yeah yeah i think the uh actually i think they get um some of them from South America oh is that right yep they a lot of um of a um winter produce comes from South America of course their seasons are switched oh i guess i didn't really uh-huh right so um do you want to discuss your recipe i have a recipe if you want um it filled well okay sure sure a lot of people try to stay away from this but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding yeah it and it if you um well first of all i is that right i've never heard of that take about a quarter and a half of milk and i put it in a two quart saucepan and you put it on a really low heat uh-huh and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it it ends up burning i mean no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot i don't let that worry me and i get the milk lukewarm and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it and i have this thing it's called the slender blender uh-huh it it makes the uh it makes uh a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough it's uh i don't know they're called moogoo leaves or something they're i think i know what you're talking is it like a hand held thing yeah okay yeah they're real neat i think they're real reasonably priced some of them they used to be a hundred dollars and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert but i didn't get that one i got the Black and Decker kind but uh it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk the milk you know and it does an excellent job or just hand beat it i guess you could use a hand mixer but i don't think it pure i don't think it gets it good enough and then before the milk gets too hot um i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good and then about a half a cup of sugar uh-huh and i let it pretty much i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds and it's it starts thickening when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little i don't know it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch and you just keep beating it in and it's the the trick is is to have this blender oh huh so if you were you'd have to probably almost go out and someone who's just going to make it first time it's you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders huh and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate or after it's thickened i cook it for a good once it starts boiling i just i cook it for a good seven minutes uh-huh seven to ten minutes and then you can make chocolate or you can take it off and when it cools a little you put um really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter and that makes French vanilla um custard oh wow that is really interesting are you saying to use like um for chocolate like unsweetened unsweetened yeah a chocolate powder yeah that cocoa yeah the unsweetened it comes in like a real dark can our mothers used to use it and then yeah right i have some i just want yeah we all used to yeah it's the unsweetened kind it's not like Nestle Quik i suppose you could use that i yeah but um right okay cooking chocolate that's really interesting i've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat i well i used to make the regular pudding the chocolate and put it in the pie shell and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day where you cut the pie it would soak into the pie shell and it was like red and i'm like oh this is kind of groedy well how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own um no actually i found it in one of my mother's um homemade cookbooks i mean something she had collected out of Woman's Day or something is that right oh neat that is just really neat because i so i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or or a regular beater but um it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good yeah but i still think a beater would do it good enough um the trick is to get the cornstarch uh-huh um yeah right in the in the lukewarm milk sometimes i put the cornstarch in a separate bowl and i would put it in the sink and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good it seems to be better than putting the the cornstarch into the liquid it once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top so you put the milk in the cornstarch yeah and i'll do this uh sometimes i'll put my after I pour that into my back into my saucepan i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg so and then put that back in the saucepan yep and then you know if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more huh that's because by the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the sometimes the cocoa is like my husband really likes it thick he says i can stick the spoon right in this because i'm always worrying it won't firm up because it when you take it out of the saucepan it's like boy i hope this thickens a little more because it's not like real package thick you know when you cook a package it's it's a little less uh-huh but i put it in a nice glass bowl and um some people don't like that that film on the pudding so you can put uh Saran Wrap over the top uh-huh and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap so when you pull the Saran Wrap back you sort of should be a little careful pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap and i might put it back on but um do you do you put it in the refrigerator then or you yeah after well when it starts steaming a lot uh i definitely yeah put it in the refrigerator uh-huh but um i my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard that's yeah so that's why i do that right that's true i knew that yeah yeah so well i don't know that's my my great hard recipe  oh no i hadn't heard about Bo Jackson though what happened well Bo was uh playing football actually you know he plays both football and baseball and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip yeah plays for the Raiders and there's been arthritis and he's been out for a number of of seasons games and it just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent so they're saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury uh i didn't know that so they had uh they're having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors and since that makes him more money anyhow well yeah it does he has more money out of the uh ads than he does the game itself yeah he does it it's pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore i well i think uh Joe Montana got something like a million dollars for saying i'm going to Disneyland i wouldn't be surprised whatsoever on the same program they had Michael Jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the Chicago Bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing McDonald's and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike and then of course he's got uh Wheaties also outrageous prices yeah and that's that's in a year that's uh what would you do with all that money uh i i wouldn't know what to do with it we just discussing what we'd do with five thousand yeah i could make that go a lot of places it's amazing anymore there's a also a program on this evening about the a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics uh the uh achievement for the let's see how are they putting that uh the school let's see the academic report board review board uh the dean's being it more involved with the athletes uh-huh yeah i was watching that yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how they're getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature i guess anymore it's just a big business yeah well uh some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them though they do it just for the love of it uh-huh uh i think it also probably also more is more as you get into the the big schools the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools they're all doing it just for the for the love of the game because they're not getting the big revenues from anyone well that's not necessarily true though you know uh i'm an avid uh basketball fan of Bull uh-huh and i know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits yeah or you know and so you know he's doing it because he wants to they actually mentioned a little on the fact that he's started to instigate a program where he's actually uh not necessary they say he's getting around the rules somewhat but it's actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other students who don't meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then then to junior college yeah i heard about that i haven't heard much about it though so at least that's uh some way that they're you know i i guess the best part about it you can't just drop off all scholarship scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in it's intentions help a lot of people who couldn't afford to go to school yeah but that seemed like it was actually uh you know if there's a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way you don't think yeah i don't know if it would be dishonest or honest though well uh at least it's hopefully still helping the the student yeah it's yeah it's helping the kids you're not uh going to graduate somebody who still can't read and write uh it's happened too much that's way too much yes it has yeah well we veered from the subject yeah but that's quite all right i think they just want to have some kind of normal conversation i hope so it's happened to me more than once does it yeah almost all the time really well there's been uh actually some pretty interesting interesting topics that i've had i've had things from uh tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three i've participated in i haven't had anything on fishing i've had uh oh arts and crafts uh football basketball and baseball uh-huh well heck you child rearing or child day care uh-huh and couple other things i can't remember wow sounds like you participated quite a bit yeah well almost everyday the the lines are open uh-huh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split uh half-and-half is it well that's good oh you know uh i had to start out doing it i done it about five times and then uh here lately they i've been letting them catch me um-hum well that's good well it's been enjoyable speaking with you all right well you take it easy bye all righty good-bye  oh go ahead i i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was oh well i'm not an expert i just had a little i've i've seen a little pollution in my time it's uh uh the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a Raid repellent and uh that was really quite dangerous i'm not certain that that was that's that's really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is is uh is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease uh well there there's two things uh the one i'm interested the most i guess myself uh would be the the Freons i mean for air conditioning the one i guess that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the Freons in air-conditioning that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad well the you know that that's another arguable issue and i i've seen the uh uh uh assuming you can buy into global warming i yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and they'd set those uh all the no i heard about it though uh it was it was it was interesting but uh i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit was that before i didn't see it was that before they actually did that or it was what yes and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer which actually happened and it it actually yes it actually happened uh because of that you know it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was the which is the national anyway research people and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough and it's it's going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but right the the the the the the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh i'm uh member of the American Meteorological Society and are you don't you don't work at TI yeah i do oh okay but i'm uh i only i do that in my formalize where do you work in research or no i'm a planner a production planner oh okay but i i i'm in the active reserves as a weatherman so no okay yeah uh i i keep up from time to time but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is but um if there is uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isn't if there isn't and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and mess stuff on cars yeah uh well i'm kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh i i'll do that in a minute i i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage well do you have an older car you know not not using no no no i i have been working on an older car but it to yeah really oh i'm a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day uh uh well i'm restoring one i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane i don't think you'll have any trouble i'm not having any problem it's a seventy oh yeah yeah and uh no i i think uh i uh work on my own cars and uh i don't think that's a problem i thought i'm saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline but did you have another question you said you had another question uh oh yeah i the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was what did you see the advertisements uh when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know did you see any of those uh i it was yeah no i didn't see that that i know that the uh that's it must have been channel thirteen i don't recall although i thought it was on CNN oh i well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose that's that's the ultimate uh pollution problem it was a somewhat of a commercial because it came i saw it regularly and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh well how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know well it's interesting that the Chernobyl accident uh actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went um covered a a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i i think it's drawn in uh i think gets in there because i can't think of the other trace but i saw a a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but i i i guess i can be a little sympathetic but you know there's some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that that's the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and oh really yeah there there's probably a lot of natural things uh but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution yeah uh it i guess it's got to be really i don't know i don't know if it's air pollution it's uh it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know well it that's the thing is that i think i think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel the problem is is it's like Los Angeles people don't people don't want to use mass transit so yeah oh yeah well i live in Arlington and there there there are no buses i mean there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus well i know it it's uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean well my boss drives forty miles one way each day yeah and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles yeah and and they don't think it well i guess they do think something of it but um not enough to you know you consider how much um but then you get into all these issues of of whether it it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the out of the yeah out of downtown so we get away from the the smog my my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles uh when when the valley was clean yeah and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh yes yes you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know well do you know because they she don't even she doesn't put fifty miles a day on the car General Motors apparently has one that they're they're testing i think it's no it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing almost no no you're right i i have seen them but uh they have a battery car but they uh i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it suppose and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that huh well the Road and Track was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh they apparently think they're close yeah i i think uh there could be a lot of people i think people close this is really we're were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think well there there's still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess it's been about a month ago and saw this there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research yeah they've got a they've got a area over in the SE building too which is uh but it's a solar uh it's for uh they got got some money from a power company and it's probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever yeah well do you work in that C building no i'm actually in the south building but uh oh well i'm at i was uh i'm the facility so i've been in all most of the buildings anyway oh well i'm in i'm in the C building been there for all my life oh yeah well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now and they they've got several different uh areas where they're called solar lab huh it's right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there well that's been a i know the focal plain array is they were taking space to for a long time yeah but the solar project you know TI's been into it for years and i guess it's just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon you know who wants to yeah i mean we want to not pollute but uh at a dollar a gallon uh it's hard to beat the amount of energy you get from yeah i've seen some i think then again i'm surprised now i didn't think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show there was nothing uh and there was no place for air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol there they had one with spots on it and something i didn't go but it was it was showing they i mean uh hum i didn't see did you go an article no i didn't i didn't go so i wish oh i i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and they're they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old V8s they're all brand new engines uh of course they're burning gasoline of course they've done a lot now and uh whether you know that's one way you know uh uh for on air pollution i i i don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really they've got catalytic converters everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if you're in that you know if you're concerned about that i mean if you're you're you're knowledgeable on that well there well they uh it's interesting though because my cars are older and so i didn't have to if you live in Dallas County you have to have your have to have it checked and it's great i had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned and so apparently  well i uh before i was married i used to play a lot of sports uh-huh and uh but when i got married and had children and everything it seems like i keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations so i haven't done a lot of uh exercise on purpose what about you uh-huh well it's funny this week yesterday i started exercising seriously oh really this weekend i cleaned out my closets and uh a couple years ago i too got married i haven't have any children yet but this weekend i cleaned out some closets and i found a bathing suit that i had bought uh-huh tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me oh no that can be awful so yesterday i went to uh a spa i belong to a private spa and went in and and got with a trainer and uh he checked body fat content and we set up a program for me to work on and i went back tonight also uh-huh oh that's good so i've been two nights in a row and i i'm going to take it pretty seriously i'm going to start going every night just you know even if i i like tonight i only went for thirty minutes but i at least did something uh-huh do you work out on like is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and a few like three different types of uh uh weight lifting for my legs and and my hips uh-huh uh-huh and then i did a hour of aerobics um-hum and that was really tough oh i bet and i was sore this morning when i got up but then tonight i got into a a it's sort of like an aerobics class um-hum but it's only thirty minutes and it's for your abdominals your thighs and your butt um-hum hum so and that was thirty minutes was definitely plenty so doesn't sound like low impact no it was a lot of sweat but well i've been trying to eat correctly also well that's good so have you started exercising at home or so are you motivated well i like i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise but i like to um play tennis and play racquetball i i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in uh the shape that i was satisfied with at least um-hum And uh then i have given that up but uh i would really like to start that again because i am now you know not in a position that i like myself i don't feel uh-huh good and i get you know when you get out of shape and you don't if you're easily tired um-hum and so that has made me but i i'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa and work out i just if something like uh yeah i mean i have so many chores and so many obligations every day for to add another obligation would make me feel stressed um-hum yeah um-hum and i wouldn't enjoy it but if i have something some team sport or some activity then it's kind of like having fun playing and then you then you get some of the yeah um good exercise and some of the desired results but you you're doing it for fun um-hum yeah but i really admire people who can go and work out and well i don't you know a lot of people i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it and she walks around talks to people and and um-hum i don't really get into that naturally i'm married so my husband goes a lot and we'll go and and just do what we want to do and then leave uh-huh well that's nice but yeah and swimming is a is a part that i i'd like to get into as far as my you know just aerobic activity um-hum they say that swimming is real good so i'd like to try that as well and that's probably something that that you could do you know family included yes it is kind it is family and it's fun it's a fun thing and kids enjoy that and um-hum and all and also the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation you know like a sauna or yeah you know uh hot jacuzzis or whatever they have that kind of is kind of makes it fun and stuff you know you can relax that way afterwards and things right uh-huh yeah i agree but well i guess it's getting late yeah and i should take off but uh i appreciate that that helped me helped motivate me okay think someone can do it maybe i should start thinking about it again yeah well try it or or maybe just exercise at home i bought a tape and i'm going to try doing that well yeah i bought one i went to the i bought the low impact first i thought shouldn't out of the blue just jump in uh-huh yeah that's me so but i haven't done it but i'm going to try it well you have a good night we'll see you bye-bye um-hum thanks a lot bye-bye  all right well what do you think about women's role's in the last generation what uh what changes have you seen well i have noticed a lot uh more women's roles at work which i like in management which that's good i i guess to have a woman's viewpoints and uh in a way things are handled at work especially in personnel type jobs which i think is probably better on the hand of women for uh any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that women probably understand that better than the men do so i think that's good well yeah yeah i would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than men yeah we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings i think i think that that's a good benefit i think having women uh in in higher up positions stuff like that well i've noticed that it seems uh some women are i guess what i call the feministus you know or you know very strong uh you know women's libbers and others that don't want to be and it's it's confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don't know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know uh-huh yeah right and how to treat them right right and who wants to be treated which way yeah i think they should all wear signs you know or something but uh i i i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background yeah the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure i can't figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go right if you can stay out of it although i guess although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go they couldn't do anything about it now it's kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now it's it's i'm happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don't have to go right right that's exactly right they can just watch it i always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over to the Gulf and let her fight but i think it's uh i think if they want to do it you know if that's what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it well they couldn't be worse than some of the men that's right and i don't i think it all depends on mental set more than sex right that's exactly right now they're trained and everything so let them do it if they want to that's that's the way it is in a lot of jobs you know like the firemen you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be firemen policemen and stuff like that now they get to be all that well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it right but i do object to you know someone hiring a woman just because they have to meet their quota that's exactly and i feel the same exact same way i don't think that's right that's that's really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it right you're uh you know it's the best person qualified i think and and that's the way it ought to be but it's as we know it's not yeah i i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know the right sex rather than qualifications right exactly same with a doctor in a hospital yeah that's true i hate to i hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female that's right you know she got that scholarship or a Black woman named Rodriguez right they need to give the scholarship to a woman that's true that's true with any case i hate that but but that is true but well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate right much with whatever it's with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now it's yeah ethnic any ethnic problem or race or with uh anything ethnic problems uh i think society society tends to overcompensate and we go we swing we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in um-hum don't want to hurt anybody's feelings and get everybody covered oh that's true oh yeah God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know um-hum hey sweetie or something um-hum and now everything's his you know uh his and her and everything you have to you always have to say it like that you can never say you know his you know and that never has offended me when you know when someone's talking and they say you know his job or something like that or right a wait person that's never i mean i understand that they're talking about the job not the person in the job that's that's always that's always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female but yeah she is she i i don't know i i can't say that that i i well i can't say that i did or didn't vote for her because i didn't get to vote this time but i don't know that i'm i guess i'm ready just hard to see a woman in such a i guess powerful position i think i'm more scared of her not because she's a female but because more for her political political beliefs and what she says she's going to do i think i'd be scared of anybody male or female in that position right right right although you see more and more uh more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics i know that's true and and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector right inexperience also that's something that bothers me is uh even though she is you know the treasurer forever it bothers me that i don't know that she doesn't have that much background i guess in well it's hard to say i don't know something about it just just kind of bothers me i think her backgro und totally bothers me yeah she i mean she seems on the outside uh good and everything but but i don't know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we're not used to having i'm not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models that could be yeah you're just always used to men i mean that's just something that men always did yeah the governor was you know the governor he did this right an d now we got the governor she's going to do that that's exactly right and wonder what they'll call if she was married and wonder if they'll refer to him as the first husband probably yeah and in Dallas you know we had the uh Annette Strauss and she's a uh first woman mayor so oh yeah Houston got a female mayor do they yeah i didn't know that she oh yeah she's a she's a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district oh does she really oh yeah oh Lord so i think you know i i'm not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or because or because she supported the gays i really don't know because a large you know there's a large population down there of gays big combination of both she's got covered all the bases didn't she yeah yeah she seems to be interesting i i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Leland's wife is yeah taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female mayor in Dallas one in Houston we got a female governor and there's two or three more governors in in the in the state that are females right that's really good i guess and there's quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them you know i would i i i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards right yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that so that's going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just yeah but i think we're bred that way you know i think i think it's part of the yeah exactly and that's of the of the male mystique that's that's sad to say that that that that's true though and uh so course the reason yeah i think it's going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here um-hum in the southern states than it will be up in the more liberal east and west coast right right this is you know i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here we don't have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the yeah the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road yeah yeah yeah and of course that's changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the women you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD that's right that was a good that was a good leadership the greatest force in America is mothers that women that's what they say that's true if you could mobilize the mothers you got them that's true well i hope yeah you know that they whatever these leaders of ours do that everything's for the good that just like like you said it's with man or a woman it should however they're going to be able to uh take care of us i don't know just depends on who's going to exploit us when yeah i do know though in our company we don't have a lot of upper upper management women i mean we rarely have any women that are upper management is that because they're just not uh you just don't have any women that are there or no one has i don't know ascended to that level yet i don't know that's really that's really well it's it's so uh i guess we're we're kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of men always did the you know the engineering and all this and the technology and men are so i'm i'm sure that's has a lot to do with it i've noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well there's no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there right right just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn't automatically mean you it shouldn't mean that you get promoted to that part that's right that's exactly right so but a lot of more women are starting their own businesses i've noticed than yeah and that's that's pretty interesting we have several here in Austin that have uh i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture uh place she builds library furniture oh does she that's pretty interesting and she and she's take she's taking over and it's uh it's it's a million dollar a year company and she's having a ball doing it yeah there's a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarella or a cheese company can't remember the name of it and she's a multimillionaire from it and i i just think God if only it could be me yeah yeah i've got several uh matter fact i have some friends that own machine shops and they have several  okay Art you say you own a TI or you own a uh an IBM compatible uh yeah i have one of these little Zenith laptops which uh the uh everybody here at school has to buy one uh-huh and oh you're in school oh yeah i'm a student uh at at Harvard Business School uh-huh and uh tremendously useful thing it's uh the the portability and the compactness of it are uh pretty nice it's uh you know enough that you can kind of throw it in a briefcase or uh slap it over your shoulder and carry it around what what do you use to to download into the system can you put hook up a a floppy to it uh it's got an internal three and a half inch floppy oh it's built in yeah and uh it also has a forty megabyte hard drive built in oh that's pretty good um and uh you know the batteries carry it for at least four or five hours um and so you know i use it um both in school to do uh spreadsheet analysis for various uh businesses that we're studying and also uh you know it hooks up to normal printers and what have you and uh works pretty well in that mode as well uh-huh i'm i'm curious what you use your uh home computer for uh i do i do uh word processing on it primarily uh the main reason why i'm i'm hanging on to it is because of the business that i'm in the the home computer business i have a uh-huh uh-huh a store in my house where i've got the uh the hardware and the software and i also do repair work on the system if if i started using a different computer at home then i wouldn't be using the the software and the hardware and it would be that much more difficult for me to try and market it the the product does it does it cause a problem for you to use a different computer at work than you use at home uh oddly enough no uh because i do different things with it at home i i do mostly play and at work i do mostly work uh it's you know you you you can put a game on an IBM compatible computer uh but uh uh-huh yeah you know i i don't normally do that at at work uh and i i typically deal with uh Lotus uh WordPerfect which is a spreadsheet right and uh we also have a tie in to a mainframe out in in Dallas Texas uh-huh and the mainframe has a lot of software out there where i use to interface my computer with are are you at the point where the the mainframe appears slow to you relative to your personal computer given the the ratio no um there was at one point in time where where it was continually down it it appears at though whenever i wanted to use it it wasn't working and this was about uh-huh seven ten years ago uh-huh and they made a dramatic effort of trying to reduce down time down to nothing and today uh i can't say that i can remember the last time it went down uh several months it's it's just up all the time now they take it down like on Sunday nights like for a couple of hours to do maintenance or whatever but uh unless there's something dramatic that happens with the telephone system uh usually doesn't break down and i think what they're doing is they're using satellite somehow that's to uh to transmit the signals to have a backup some to back that that system up so that there is no no down time um-hum you you don't think that they went and did a uh what is it an Ishihara uh quality analysis analysis i don't i don't know how they fixed the problem but they're uh you know the whole theme of of what they were doing was was to measure and record and and uh reduce down time uh-huh and the other big thing is uh quality satisfaction or customer satisfaction uh-huh how do how do the users feel about the the system and what are their likes and dislikes and that's that's uh that's where they they were heading and the system is fantastic so it's it's not slow if anything the the PC is now slower than the mainframe that we're transmitting from from uh New England to Dallas Texas and i'm getting responses in in split seconds that's tremendous are are your computers at work net uh networked at all or is that yeah oh well that that's another system that i link in to i i network internally to Texas Instruments in Attleboro um-hum and use the mainframe for corporation uh type programs like payroll and uh financial data bases and we also have uh uh a message system which is a worldwide network within within the corporation uh-huh where i can send telegrams to any TI site and they've also hooked up to some company to allow us to do E-mail and allow it to convert it huh to other companies so that the other companies can recognize our E-mail and now we're getting into faxes as well right off the PC that's tremendous yeah that's uh the technology is really really blow you know going going crazy with this it's clearly a uh a uh a uh productivity enhancement uh device and allows you to do uh originally i didn't think it was i thought that what ended you know we ended up doing was uh doing all of the secretarial work and the secretaries had nothing to do uh and and that i guess part of that is true uh i do all my own typing i i i don't give anymore uh paper to the secretary to type up only because it takes me longer to write it and redo it and then give it back to her again for me to sit down and and do it and correct it myself i i i am not a typist i type with two fingers but i do very well at it and uh i i do everything i do my only typing do my own foils uh it's just it's just so much easier for me to do that that that's been my experience also i've actually i guess i've been doing that since probably when i was in high school uh-huh many years ago and uh uh it it it's gotten to the point now i think where the uh secretaries are are finding other jobs to do because you know the typing and to some extent the filing is just not there anymore yeah and big paper files are disappearing the the files may be disappearing but the secretaries are not the the people people in power are are afraid to give up that status symbol uh-huh and uh although what they're doing now is is they're maintaining secretaries but they're piling more and more people onto that one secretary rather than get rid of the secretary they're they're just you know they're finding justification by adding more people to her i guess there's there's a fear that one day if the computers ever stopped working there'd be a bunch of people staring at the typewriter with no idea what to do with it well i don't know like back in my particular office there must be at least uh twenty twenty five people one secretary no typewriter it's all computers everybody's got a a PC sitting in front of their desk huh do you uh if if i assume you all are networked to a a variety of of laser printers oh uh i i have a laser printer i have access to a laser printer in my office but i don't have one tied in to my system yet uh i'm i'm networked into it but it's so inconvenient for me to to uh-huh to run all the way downstairs that that i don't use it huh because what i was what i was going to ask you is it seems like the next big jump will come with color printing you were talking about doing your own presentation and foils it would seem that color capability would be the next big sort of leap in presentation yeah well i think what i see is a different direction i don't know if you are you familiar with uh programs like Harvard Graphics where they have uh yeah like a print shop or or a thing in the system well we have uh instead of using view view foil machines we have uh a transmitter that will pick up the signal from the the monitor right and transmit it just like a view foil huh so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have a um so we we do that somewhat uh we also have uh teleconferencing where we have uh the the mainframe as being the monitor in other words if you've got foils you pull it out of the mainframe and then use the telephone speaker system to communicate with wow and and we use uh we do teleconferencing that way so that that everybody's looking at the same foil because we're pulling it off the network interesting yeah that's uh that's uh pretty powerful set of tools to give to people who traditionally have had to go through a whole production process just to get the oh yeah i can remember at one time the the uh secretaries actually had to be artists and and technicians and today uh with the laser printer they're uh really not being utilized as much as they had been in the past i'm making some really pretty foils that uh four or five years ago i wouldn't have ever dreamed i could be doing them and it's it's so easy to do uh with the with the programs that are out there now huh huh well uh Frank i think i kind of need to get back to some other things so i i hope we've talked uh all right okay i believe we have covered enough of of this for for what this is all about okay nice talking to you yeah it was a pleasure take it easy thank you bye  we've my husband's retired and we vacationed a lot and i think i've had a lot in the meantime i'm not sure i would have picked that one either shall we have a go at it uh-huh sure okay trial by jury um i think one of the facets of living in a small town is that often times you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family uh-huh so that might lead you to a biased uh decision perhaps if you were uh-huh i would think so on the other hand um i don't know if course the judge as all the expertise in that field and he's trained for that and and i'm sure there are certain rules that are set down that he goes by uh along the way to make a decision but perhaps the jury can um give their uh input as to what they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there uh have you ever sat on a jury trial yes i have yeah i have too and i found it real interesting but i did to yes but we weren't given any opportunity to make a decision as to what would happen we just said whether or not we thought the party was guilty um and he took it from there uh the last trial i sat on at the end of the session the prosecuting attorney called us into a private room and more or less instructed us to find her not guilty because even though they knew and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever which we did find her guilty against his instruction and she did flee the state uh-huh but but she was guilty and we just didn't understand why he was doing that uh-huh that would merely make for some odd behavior on the on their part my husband sat in on a jury trial a murder trial that lasted for two weeks uh-huh that left him uh i mean in the very beginning he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh guilty uh uh-huh which surprised me that that uh through the jury discussion they were able to convince him against his original opinion so maybe that speaks well for juries yeah i i remember the one that i sat in on we had quite a problem coming to a conclusion and and we came back with so many people this way and so many that way and the judge told us we couldn't leave until we came to a decision and we just could not we were split and he kept us there one evening until seven uh and everyone wanted to go home and so they were willing some of them were willing to change their uh decision just to get out of uh out of the jury room that doesn't seem fair does it no and i i couldn't believe they would do that so maybe in a way it should be left up to the judge because uh maybe the jury isn't uh going to give them an honest decision uh-huh you know i i don't know i guess if if we had more power we're just people off the street so to speak and uh-huh we don't have the the uh background to maybe make that decision the only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in uh Chicago where so many judges were guilty of so much misjustice from the bench uh-huh that after all they're only people too in that they're subject to corruption just like any other human being and they do have a lot of power uh-huh uh-huh it seems uh sometimes it seems uh rather i guess rather uh odd that one person would have that deciding factor he would be the sole factor uh determining a person's outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes uh has a lot to decide has to decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case too maybe we both agree then that we need to keep juries and i think so i think so we could go on i think we've reached a decision nice visiting with you bye i think we have thank you bye-bye  the home that uh we bought back in the early eighties was uh was was typical tract home and we were uh trying to find something that would would get us into the housing market as it were thinking that someday we'd move on uh the economy however changed that a little bit and looks like we're going to be in this home for a while but uh it's not too bad um-hum some of the things that we didn't uh think about when we bought it turned out uh worked out all right for us was we bought on a top of a hill and some of our neighbors down the the lower part uh get their yards flooded every once in a while doesn't get up into the house but it just makes a bit of a mess in the in the yard itself a little bit of debris and a little bit of runoff on the uh yeah on the uh grass area it's kind of hard to keep grass in certain areas and i'd never really thought about that but but we're pretty much at the very top of this little hill and all the runoff from from the concrete uh the shopping center near us and the alleyway all that goes down to our neighbors so so that was a little thing that i'd never really considered and was fortunate that it worked out that way yeah uh another uh calamity i guess that befalls some purchasers that i didn't uh think about when i first purchased this house was what can happen right immediately behind you we are on the edge of a development that has a little retainer wall that separates us from the rest of the from a street and a little little uh business area and uh some friends of ours moved into a house and a couple of years later a a uh shopping center built up behind them and it was a grocery store that had that stocked at night at about three am every night oh oh no they would run the trash compactor and it was so loud it would wake them up and they never got used to it and they finally had to move they just couldn't stand that noise then oddly enough after that they uh uh it it it closed down now that grocery store isn't there and hasn't been there for about six years now so uh it's kind of a a bad thing to happen but we happen to have landed again in a very lucky spot there is a little business development behind us that's a bit of a a a little bank and a couple of dry cleaning things and little strip shopping center but it's several houses down because the property that's the other side of our little wall is a triangle shape and the wedge part of the triangle got too skinny to do anything more than put some grass and trees there there's not even a parking lot so it it's a nice uh two or three houses on either side of us is nice grass and trees and oh good and then across from that is a a major four lane street and then across from that is is uh the parks of the city that we live in has some soccer fields and some baseball fields and that completely goes on to the horizon so as far as we can look out over our little retaining wall is grass and trees and parks oh that's really nice and we really didn't didn't uh i mean that wasn't our consideration when when we bought it it was a complete blank lot they hadn't even built the house yet and we were new to the this whole process and all we knew is that it was a the cheapest house that this this tract development uh sold so it turned out to be pretty good and where do you what area do you live in oh okay i live in Dallas uh Rowlett Dallas yeah it's uh it's a nice area as it were about the only two things that uh didn't work out too well for us well one of them's nice in in a way we're on the beginning of a corner we live on a on a U shaped drive and we're the first house that they actually started turning to make for a turn on a on a cul-de-sac not a cul-de-sac but a turn on a ninety degree turn on the street which meant that we're not jammed right up against our neighbor's house uh-huh oh that's really nice there's there's like twelve or fifteen feet on one side but on the other side there's over sixty feet before the next house because they they set us back a little ways and they turned it sideways so our houses begin to to turn to to make this turn as it were so we're real far away and we have a really large lot we have a bigger lot than all the rest of the the ones down the street but uh as it turned out we decided we learned that neither one of us really likes taking care of all that grass so it it was a bit of a drawback but uh it'll probably make for a good selling point if we ever give it to someone that does like all that grass oh yeah it probably will and uh we did also end up in a in an area that we didn't we didn't realize when we bought it that uh the soil is that uh black clay and it yeah we have that it tends to uh go to the extremes of being dry or being moist and it it's done a little bit of a foundation damage that uh most of these houses get no matter how much watering we do uh-huh so we have to contend with doors that sometimes sometimes the during the year don't uh just close just right and uh things of that nature right i guess that's just Texas though you have to live with that yeah that's true there are there is a little segment little segment up near McKinney and up near um uh they said out near Wylie there's some some little areas where the soil is completely sandy and then it it uh goes back into the black gumbo around it hum uh-huh but there are some housing developments that uh the guy that came out and inspected our damage was saying that there are some little little pockets of neighborhoods that don't have these problems at all and had i only known you know maybe i'd have looked over there really uh what about your house well we bought uh our first house at the end of eighty six and like i said it's out in Rowlett and it's it's real nice it's four bedroom and it's kind of a tract area too we've got people behind us and on both sides of us i don't really like that too well i keep telling my husband that our next house is going to sit square in the middle of at least ten acres of land but uh it's a it's a good size and it's something we can stay in and grow in for quite a while i guess uh hopefully till the real estate market turns around like you we we bought when it was down a little bit but we've had so many repossessions in our neighborhood that we couldn't sell for anywhere near what we've got into it so um-hum it uh hopefully it'll turn around it's true that there's always that chance i guess sometime yeah oh i think it will eventually out here they're building more new houses all the time though and people can go and buy a brand new one that's never been lived in for less than they can get a used one so i guess that's what they would choose hum but there uh well as a first time home buyer i know what you mean there's a lot of things you're not sure about what to look out for the only really trouble we've had with our house is the seals breaking between the double panes and water moisture um-hum um-hum gets in there and you can hardly see out of them now they've got so much and the builder's gone bankrupt and the glass company's gone bankrupt so we don't really have any recourse and just hope they break or something um-hum nothing you can do that's right there's nothing you can do yeah but other than that we haven't had any problems yeah we've got we've got one that's done that uh we've been pretty fortunate most of our neighbors have had many more um um-hum i don't know that we've done anything different to prevent ours from doing that but most of our neighbors have ended up replacing them uh buying some nice Anderson windows or some some uh name brand windows uh one neighbor went with whatever Sears installs and they have the the different kind of window that the kind that you can tilt out either pane and and raise or lower you know lower the top down or the bottom up or tilt it in both of them tilt in so you can clean them or and it's a real strange oh uh-huh mechanical beast but uh they haven't lost their seal yet so it's i guess there's a quality some quality in it yeah we we had um our insurance our home owner's insurance actually covered some of it because i told them it looks like something's eating into the glass it turns like a milky white you know so i said well how do we know it wasn't some kind of chemical or something that's eating into that which would be covered under a glass rider so so um-hum they replaced like seven of them and we just had to pay the deductible but hum they wouldn't that insurance company went out of business in Texas because they had so many claims that they couldn't make a profit and so now none of the other insurance companies will will consider covering that goodness yeah that's which i can understand it's really not that'd be hard to hard to cover all the ones that go bad damaged oh yeah it's true but i bet we've got at least seven more now that are bad goodness just about every window in our house i guess eventually is going to have to be replaced yeah and it'd be nice to do it with with all the same kind too yeah well what they did is just they came in and just cut the glass out of the frame and put more glass in hum that's over a year ago and it's it hasn't had any problems yeah seemed to and those held that's interesting i didn't know they could do that somebody told me that they thought that too was caused by just a little bit of shifting in the foundation puts a little pressure on that seal and makes them pop open yeah that could be but once you get that moisture in there it it can fog up and not go away quickly enough right well i hear my kid calling me i better go see what he wants okay bye okay well it was good talking to you bye  okay we're rolling i uh what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy what would you say i'd encourage it um-hum it's a good general education education education for a a bachelor's degree um-hum um-hum and obviously and obviously it's where they don't have a any post graduate program there but you get a an excellent wide uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you don't they don't graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but um-hum um-hum maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there um-hum um-hum um-hum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh um how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life well the for some people it's good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that that stage in their life uh other people it uh it's um-hum uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think um-hum more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just the the cost of how much you're gonna pay uh-huh no matter where you go to school uh-huh and if you've been in for twelve years i'm sure you've you've got a your share of student loans that uh you're probably going to be paying off or have been or well i sort of one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working uh you know it's sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt uh-huh oh that's good uh i couldn't you you couldn't do it otherwise oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they they've got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts i mean you could have uh yeah i think if there's any major piece of advice i'd give is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt yeah it's not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college so it's it's really kind of crazy exactly it's it's staggering when you think that just here in central New York is uh Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am and uh um-hum they're looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now really a year huh at just a small i mean they they they are select it is a select college yes yes i know i was actually i think i was thinking of trying to get a job there i heard of it oh yeah but you're talking incredible tuitions now i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh um-hum yeah i get i i just couldn't imagine i mean it's more money than i make in a year so you know it you know me being one person with a above the median yeah income for New York state you know i'm a second i'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and uh um-hum um-hum i even even as a somebody making twice what i was making how could you put half of that into um-hum to your child's education and then just when they make made make it to the college years it's yeah yeah my God i can't imagine well my my real feeling about about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it yes but what you don't forget is the growing up it's really the period when people become adults i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways but really it's the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to i'd be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn self-discipline and so forth would be appropriate for them or or it's also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has self-discipline who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own yeah and want to develop that and that yeah the same it's the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum you know i i agree with that because i see people that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didn't go to college and um-hum um-hum they do the same old things they did in high school the same patterns of behavior you mean yeah yeah and same patterns of behavior same uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and it's like it's like frozen time you know exactly it's kind i find it kind of sad i really do it is it really is that they haven't found anything anything better that um or their experiences haven't been broadened at all that you know its a um-hum it's a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear all these different sides of the story yeah right that you never thought of and uh that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point differing points of view you know or different opinions um-hum um-hum yeah in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems yeah exactly yeah yeah the the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of thirty thirty thousand students oh i and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and they're they're just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they yeah they i don't see them getting i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school uh-huh and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution um-hum but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get right pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years well your education's a lot what you make of it too so yeah yeah exactly and if you're alienated i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in yeah well i i've seen more graduates from MIT and that being uh-huh i work in a in a laboratory an Air Force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh MIT graduates that are in there and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that i think i've ever run into even even more so yeah yeah uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i i mean i have to admit confess to that yeah it's sort of a a rare select environment yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and you know certain things that don't bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that yeah right right sure but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it it's a i i have more respect i have a lot of respect for MIT master's and doctorate uh yeah it's a top rated institution and now i degrees but but their undergrads are like i i'm amazed at at that's a lot of them even graduated um-hum um-hum but uh i don't know well i i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research right right and the professors who go there and you're not going to see the professors you know you're going to see some TA you know uh nope the so they put they they want you know they want the best and they don't think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and that's a one standard but it's not relevant to what they need yeah no it's interesting that you mention that i didn't think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange uh-huh instruct professors from other schools but um-hum um-hum uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself it's the future officer corps and so right i hear horror horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help um-hum for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day um-hum i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh um-hum would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and hm yeah you won't get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you can't blame the professors either because you look at their job description you'd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and no no and that no right right publish first and then yeah and and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time right so i'd say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job yeah but oh well yeah it's there's a lot of factors that people don't ever ever consider um-hum in in their selection of a college and uh i don't know maybe i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that  so so what movies have you seen lately i really haven't seen any movies lately i the only two movies i've seen were uh uh King Ralph which really was depressing wasn't any any good oh was bad yeah oh that's disappointing i was thinking about going to see that and well it's not worth the whatever five bucks or four four fifty whatever you pay for you know to get into the movie but yeah wait for it to come out on videotape i guess yeah yeah or i saw Chima Para Diso uh Chima Para Diso what's the other one oh say that again what's that it's a foreign film uh-huh it's a an Italian film about uh this guy who uh who from when he was a little kid like ten years old uh-huh oh Cinema Para De Simo oh okay because you're saying it with a you're saying it little Italian oh are you Italian oh okay that's why go ahead yeah italian accent yeah yeah it's it's about a movie about you know this guy who was running a a movie uh-huh you know movie studio whatever he ran he ran a machine that was pretty good didn't you think so yeah i saw it too yeah it was i really liked it my wife and i loved it yeah i thought yeah i thought that most Americans might not like it because you know of it's it's not that good of a quality film but i mean it's the meaning behind it that i liked uh-huh yep that's true yeah it had a really uh i thought the story was really nice and i thought uh the guy that played the projectionist i just thought was superb you know he was great uh and the little boy was good too uh-huh i i thought they did an excellent job of actually aging the person you know from when he was a little kid to little older to little older to except the last the very last you know the last person the last actor that played the kid uh-huh you know when he had gray hair he didn't look anything like him but you know up until that point they did a really good job of keeping you know an actor who yeah yeah yeah they did well i think that's the guy that uh it was like his story uh-huh i think he was like a Italian director or something like that and i think that was himself he was he that was his own story right yeah on what's made him successful or whatever yeah so of course he picked probably all these really good looking young people you know yeah yeah i liked that too yeah um we um my wife and i are planning on trying to go see um yeah uh Silence of The Lambs tonight yeah i hear that's pretty good yeah it's a suspense well i guess it's ranked number one now it's supposed to be pretty good suspenseful yeah but are you good at do you like suspenseful movies like that yeah because see i i'm not really one that likes real suspense i like the nice lighthearted comedies most of the time oh is it yeah i do well it depends on what mood you're in too you know yeah that's true yeah but uh like for example Tequila Sunrise i liked that yeah well that well that was that's with uh who's what's his name's in it uh uh i don't know Mel Gibson and uh what's his yeah that was a good movie too that was good i yeah is that supposed to be something like that one yeah yeah something like that except it's it's supposed to be really you know suspenseful yeah so i guess but you know we're it's been rated pretty well and every all the critics like it so and every word of mouth has been pretty good on it so yeah that's pretty good yeah we're we're going to go see that probably tonight well what have you seen that that uh actually let's see we we uh we've rented a couple movies lately you know because you get them on videotape we rented uh just last night we watched um David Lynch's uh movie Blue Velvet uh-huh which which is that it it sort of has some of the some of the music behind it did you ever watch Twin Peaks no i don't watch that show yeah well that it has some of the music we've watched we watched Twin Peaks because uh uh a little bit so it have you know and i think she had seen part of it before uh-huh friends of hers had rented it and she'd seen part of it but we thought we'd rent the whole thing and actually it's a pretty good movie but it's not great you know uh-huh they said it's supposed to be really weird but because that David Lynch has like a weird style but i didn't think it was really weird you know not as weird as i don't know i we also uh-huh maybe you expected too much out of it yeah i think yeah that's probably true yeah we also saw Wild At Heart which is also a David Lynch movie that that that had been out now that was a weird movie uh-huh Wild At Heart that was yeah that was about what it was it was about uh a guy uh Nicholas Cage does Elvis Presley like a like a pseudo Elvis Presley impersonation through the whole movie he's like a real violent uh uh-huh twenty year old and he uh he's in love with this girl that's about sixteen or seventeen and they leave he's involved with like a murder and then um he they go to uh they go to like Louisiana and Texas and uh he get they get more he gets more involved with this robbery and whatever but it's sort of so he just gets in trouble everywhere yeah he gets in trouble everywhere he goes it's real violent um and uh you know which is like what David Lynch's other movies were about you know the so i don't know i just i didn't think it was that good my wife liked it a little bit more than i did she looks she looks at more some of the uh more creativeness behind it you know she likes the different type of movies yeah yeah yeah but i didn't think it was that good i don't i don't like to look too deep into movies if it's good it's good if it's not it's not yeah that that's sort of the way i feel too i don't know what else we just saw something recently yeah i want to go see The Doors that's what i want to go see yeah they say that's pretty good well how old are you i'm twenty one twenty one oh see you're young so you you see i'm thirty one so you see this as like a mythical thing you know so you're like uh-huh right well i mean i i you know i'm pretty familiar with the story of Jim Morrison i mean i don't know everything about it but yeah uh-huh yeah it's one of the things uh if you read in the newspapers and stuff he's the critics really like it or they really don't uh-huh yeah so i think uh but i think it's supposed to be well done uh i heard i heard that it that what what is it Siskel and Ebert someone told me that Siskel and Ebert said that one of the two liked the whole movie but he doesn't like the ending so he wouldn't recommend the movie and he didn't like the ending because uh-huh of the way Jim Morrison's life ended and it's like that's ridiculous i mean that's a true life story How can you not like something that really you know is if it happened it happened you're just telling a story right yeah yeah uh-huh that's true yeah i guess i guess uh i well i was watching uh Arsenio Hall the other night and uh uh-huh the actor that plays Jim Morrison's one of the other uh Val Kilmer uh not Val Kilmer the um Tom McLaughlin who plays one of the other characters in the band one of the other men in the band uh was on was on uh Arsenio and he was talking about it you know and uh he said that uh they tried to stick pretty much to you know uh-huh the real story yeah the real story and and and for to for all of them to get an understanding of how their characters were they could they watched older videotapes you know of their them in interviews and things like that so they tried to make it pretty you know close to the line right but uh they also said that whatever the guy that directed it yeah i don't he uh he's very he really liked The Doors so it was very much his impression too you know so so if you have right yeah Oliver Stone isn't it yeah yeah and he's a very strong willed person and his his ideas whatever came through you know with however so they said if if you um yeah but he's a good director so i mean he should still be able to yeah so so if you like his view and his direction in other words then you'll really like the movie you know so probably if you liked his other two movies uh those are like Wall Street and Platoon then uh-huh oh i liked Platoon it was all right but i didn't see Wall Street yeah yeah if you like Platoon yeah if you liked Platoon you'll probably really like this because it takes pretty much the same direction for the time you know uh i think yeah so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good well i think i'll go see that this weekend or next weekend one or the other yeah because i really want to see it i wanted to see it uh about two weeks ago when i had a chance to go see it but i i went home for the weekend and they didn't have it playing home uh-huh for like spring break and yeah oh you in college yeah i'm still in college well why are you participating in this study uh my uh roommate took a voice over course yeah um-hum and they told him to sign up for this and he asked me if i wanted to do it and i said sure you know it's like just you know to help out whatever you know the the more participants you have the bigger yeah yeah yeah the more participants the better it works out because i'm a voice researcher uh you get a bigger pool of all the different regions of and and right uh-huh yeah that's true i guess they wouldn't be called dialects but they're pretty close sometimes yeah that's what they're yeah that's what they're really looking for i think just how we speak also looking where we pause and where we don't things like that yeah but that's pretty that's good um what do you get many movies on campus right yeah well the the good thing about campus is that we have this uh system that uh uh it's a it's called UAB uh university something or other i don't know and they give out like movies they show movies in the theatre for a dollar uh-huh right yeah and and so you know like every other day or or so they have like movies for a dollar Sometimes they're even free i think uh they showed uh Chima Para Diso free uh-huh uh-huh uh but i missed it so i rented it the other day yeah yeah because my wife and i saw it in the theatre we really liked it uh-huh yeah i liked it but i didn't i didn't know if the Americans would like it so much they might you know look into it and say uh this is low budget film and it's not really that good but i mean i like the story yeah it was a great that's a i think that's that's one thing too um you know you can't get so much caught up in the expense right as as you do a good telling a good story and i thought that was that movie really told a good story yeah yeah and and i think if you really like the story going along with it you don't notice that it's a little bit you know it might not have as many camera angles or it may not have right you know uh because the you know the character actors the town the community people were just great they just seem so real you know they came right off the screen they were they were i mean i you know i i go to Italy every summer except i missed last summer but i mean it's like that you go into the small towns especially you know like in where he was in Sicily uh-huh uh-huh and the southern part of Italy everything is like that you know and no one has any money you know you just barely get by But everybody is like a big family and it's like it's just like that so that's why i liked it i guess i'm a little biased but i i i i i thought right but see i really think yeah i i think those characters came right off the screen in that story you know it was really enjoyable and and my wife we thought the same thing we were so pleasantly surprised yeah  well do you have a lawn yes we have a house with a big backyard for the kids to play in and a pretty good size front yard oh good so who cuts the grass my husband it's not a job that i enjoy at all well i used to own a home and when i owned my house i had a small yard and a small front yard and a small backyard then i cut the grass but i sold it so now i live in an apartment so you don't have to fool with any of that anymore so i don't have to fool with any of it no well i'm big into the plant i like the the flower beds and plants a lot better than i do the lawn oh then my wife and you would probably get along well um-hum so yeah i had used to have a garden until the kids got older and we don't have any more room in the backyard so now all i've got is flowers instead of vegetables yeah we talk about um Laura talks about growing uh right right now she's interested i think in a herb garden she mentioned this morning that she could grow just you know flower box hum um-hum and i think that's but i think uh after after we um after i finish school and we're ready to you know settle down someplace and i get a decent job then we'll look for something probably with a nice size yard that we can have a garden yeah it's nice to have nothing is better than going out there and picking your own tomatoes or different vegetables and things to eat yeah yeah that yeah that and that's the big problem with being in an apartment is we've talked about it and even uh Laura even said you know as a wedding present we should ask for these big pots you know that we could put on the front porch and because the apartment complex actually we have the whole front porch and somebody else lives on the other side so we thought about you know having putting it in pots and putting the pots just on our steps um-hum um-hum and growing maybe tomatoes or flowers like right now it would be beautiful in in Maryland you know daffodils are just all blooming so it would be really pretty um yeah container gardening is really pretty easy because i've done some of it before um-hum you just need to get the you need to get the right mix of soil so that it doesn't dry out yep yep and so that your plants because and then you have to you still have to water them a lot of times once a here in Dallas you have to water sometimes twice a day because it gets so hot in the summer yeah well we wouldn't have to worry about that right now we're going through we just it just rained all day today or it's been raining most of the morning drizzling off and on but yeah um well we've got a beautiful day and there are people out everywhere all of our neighbors are out scalping their lawn for the first time oh really this is what is it i guess your growing season's just about to begin oh yes we hit our we'll hit our last spring freeze it snowed here as late as May before but that was really unusual our our our last freeze is usually about April fifteenth um-hum yeah yeah that's a and so we're all everybody's out planting and buying and yeah see we're a little bit later than that but that's right that's about right about the same yeah seeing what died um-hum but i think um i think you you though must have much warmer weather through the winter so that's yeah it makes it nice for gardening when it's when it's like that because we can grow a lot of things even through the winter that uh y'all can't grow we can start i can start a garden in July i've done that and and plant some of the uh um-hum sturdier crops broccoli and things like that you have to really water it a lot when it's when it's young like that and it's in the heat but then yeah yeah and then July and August yeah then as the fall comes on you get a you can get a really beautiful second crop of a lot of the cooler weather vegetables and sometimes that's the only some peas and different things like that that's the only time of the year you can grow them um-hum hum because otherwise it's too it gets if you start them when it's cooler in the spring then it gets too hot in the summer right yeah that jeez i never thought of that because see here our growing season is basically done by um well you might have some tomatoes still blooming in uh in October the begining very begining first week of October um-hum but normally everything's done by September end of September means you're basically done growing anything yeah um yeah but it gets a lot colder up there a lot quicker because we can grow sometimes there have been times when when i've grown stuff out i've grown broccoli up and through November um-hum yeah because it oh gee that'd be nice and still have it producing and okra okra will grow real okra will grow to be six foot tall it's just um-hum we don't even grow okra up here yeah you probably don't have the right temperatures and stuff probably not too many people eat it up there either it seems to be kind of a southern delicacy yeah we don't have the right whatever yeah well i think it it it it's getting um a little bit more popular because see there's a lot of the um first you know first the big wave of Tex-Mex food came by you know and so we're we're big into tacos and stuff up here now and and taco salads and things um-hum which they probably Mexican people don't even know what a taco salad is but i think it's now it's moving up too because uh just a change you know just something different yeah plus it's a little bit more vegetable oriented and i think the uh the mid Atlantic states have been a long time holdout for beef and potatoes yeah i think it's our Irish descent maybe so yeah but i think it it's changing now yeah so i so we do know what okra is i wouldn't have known what it was when i was a teenager though um-hum oh well what's your favorite plant if you were you know you were talking about your containers maybe you were going to get those started what would you like to put in them well we were going to probably just going to start well because we're going to be moving we're talking about just putting throwing tomatoes in um-hum you know and then uh but also things like tulips i think uh i would have liked to had flowers like daffodils blooming right now you know yeah tulips is just kind of late because you have to you have to force them um-hum if you were going to do that you might put some strawberries in there around the edges yeah we we talked about that too in fact um our sister-in-law Laura's brother's wife you know was talking about you know putting strawberries uh moving their strawberries because they just moved um-hum i it's this problem with being in school you know they just moved and they took their strawberries that they had out in their yard and put them all in containers and they're going to decide what they're going to do with them i think but they're going to let them bloom this year in the containers yeah they'll work that way and they're they're kind of pretty they've got little white flowers and um-hum um-hum would you have to stake them up do aren't they do they grow along the ground strawberries long as you no they'd grow kind of like a vine they they put out little feelers kind of like an ivy would uh-huh yeah and and along those is where that's where the strawberry grows and it will eventually take over an area you plant them when you plant strawberries you plant them like six to eight inches or more you can even plant further than that but to cover an area so you cover you put them eight inches apart all through a flower bed huh and by the next year you'll have pretty much a solid bed of strawberries oh see i've never grown strawberries they're real simple that's why i like them i just put a bunch out because you just put them out there and you water them um-hum the bugs don't least here at least here the bugs don't particularly bother them and they don't require a lot of fertilizing or care you know during the rest of the year yeah um-hum just water yeah and then about every five years you have to dig them up and throw them away and start over again they don't last forever um-hum well they say aren't maybe you're supposed to cut them back cut them and it that can help but you just get to a point where they're just not productive anymore yeah it's just a kind of uh just the way the plant is yeah rotationary thing yeah oh that's interesting see because i've never really grown strawberries lot of tomatoes but never really strawberries yeah i like tomatoes but i always end up with when i've grown them i i end up with the little cherry tomatoes uh yeah just thousands of them and i can't figure out what to do with them all hundreds of thousand you can't even give them away yeah because everybody else is growing i can remember as a kid growing up my whole family all my family grew strawberries grew excuse me grew tomatoes the same kind of thing so whenever somebody would come over your house they'd always bring some tomatoes well but you grew your own tomatoes yeah so if somebody brings you half a dozen tomatoes it doesn't do you any good because you already had a half a dozen you know pulled that day yeah it's really funny yeah some other things that'll grow good in those containers and you can you can mix and match the flowers with your your vegetables and grow around them marigolds and impatiens uh-huh oh yeah they do real good especially impatiens because you tend to get shade when you're on a porch area part of the time um-hum i mix all all my flower beds are mixed up i've got onions behind the irises and well that's makes sense though all back and forth and around yeah because they're going be they'll grow now from now until the about middle of June then i'll have all the onions and they'll be out and then i'll put in some flowers um-hum some annuals for the rest of the year and some color um oh you are a big gardener huh yeah i like getting in the dirt i just don't i hate mowing yeah it's just too hot and it has to be done too often yeah i guess the more you plant the less you have to mow yeah because that's a when i had my yard it was you know it was it was really a hassle uh cutting grass was just a terrible just the thought of it was a terrible thing oh i used to hate it yeah with ours it wouldn't be so bad we had a self propelled mower but the self propelled part broke oh and so it doesn't and then and then it weighs a ton yep because it's when it's self propelled it's heavy yeah because it's yeah and it's so it's supposed to pull itself along and my husband it doesn't bother him and he i'm got out and mowed for him one day just to be nice so he wouldn't have to do it when he got home and i said what is with this mower i can't even push it around the yard yeah that and you know he's like well i get more exercise pushing it around my uh my brother went out and bought a mower used you know he was looking for a lawn mower and he he just had bought a house he lived in an apartment before uh-huh and he bought a used mower it was a real big heavy one and he said that that you know basically they they sold it on him because you know it was a macho thing yeah the bigger and heavier the lawn mower the more macho the guy behind it so you know of course he wouldn't couldn't buy one of those little little tiny skinny ones that you can get at one of the uh one of the Aames or yeah the the fast mowing places you had to buy a big one you know because it meant something for your macho same reason why you have to drive a big truck with four wheels you know with four wheel drive yeah it was a macho thing he had to use that but then after he used it one year he took it back to where he got it used and he sold it back to them and traded it in for another one that was smaller because he said it was just too dang heavy yeah too many trips around the yard with that thing huh for sure yeah plus i think he lives at a small hillside too so oh gosh yeah cut trying to cut it sideways on an angle and turning around you know without it tipping over was a pain oh yeah that's the other thing with my husband he gets he he's one of these people he didn't care about the flower beds and stuff we i guess we divide it pretty well that way but he he gets real picky about the grass he wants to get out there and he cuts it on diagonal yeah and goes all this back and forth and you know and gets the weed eater out and trims all the little bits around the flower beds and all the little bits around the trees that he did n't get uh-huh he'll go out there and spend four hours on the lawn uh-huh well it's probably his his his personal time while he's cutting the grass he's probably thinking about something else i guess it's probably and plus no one bothers him you know you walk behind a lawn mower making all that noise no one ever talks to you you know you're on your own no nobody's going to bother you  yeah uh do do you uh do any work on your own cars i uh i used to i don't uh much anymore except just change the oil occasionally oh yeah yeah i actually i just uh just recently thought about buying a new car and i went and i saw all the Japanese cars and uh really liked the uh actually the Diamante which is uh sort of the luxury Nissan oh yeah uh but i i just decided i wasn't gonna get i wasn't first of all i wasn't gonna get a Japanese car that was about the time that uh oh yeah that you know all the all the sort of antitrade stuff was going on and then uh later decided that uh i'd just hang on to my own car which has about two hundred and eighteen thousand miles on it it's a Chevy Celebrity four cylinder oh my goodness that's very good and i've driven it since uh grad school and uh just decided you know i think i'll hang on to this car you know it's been so good for me for me all this time so uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was uh also a Chevy Celebrity because you had good luck with that one huh you know i've i had good luck and uh i knew enough about all the the basic maintenance you know brakes oil and that kind of stuff to do it myself so well that's uh i i'd certainly agree with your with your logic there my uh uh feelings about cars are i'd look under the hood and i see all the um all the stuff under there and i say boy my chances of of doing how shall i say it uh everything's electronic uh uh it's not that i'd i mean cancel their time it's just that uh there's so much you know you can't and you can't tune it yourself you can't do anything it's because you don't have the the tools to measure it on on the other hand i'm i i have a yeah yeah yeah a ninety Honda and uh i'm kind of on the other end of the spectrum i have let's see i have uh twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car all right and uh so you don't have any problems with it so yeah and it's a it's a absolutely flawless car it uh and it's the smoothest car i've ever ridden i uh ah what's that is it an Accord it's an Accord Accord yes and uh so the the things that personally if i ever if i had to buy another car uh yeah huh i'd be the the new American cars uh their ads intrigue me because they think they can catch up uh with uh the Japanese but as far as uh-huh i i think one of the things that they are going to have to impress me with is is again this uh the thing that impresses you about yours and that's uh frequency of repair and and absolute reliability yeah yeah because the worst thing that can happen to a person is i think is uh to have to go in and get it fixed you know it's it's yep yeah because it just breaks it more yeah there's a a that that was i i noticed that uh uh with one of my other cars uh if if there's this kind of uh natural curve of decay you know decay curve uh half the time when you take it in it's farther down the and you get it back it's farther down the curve than when you took it in yeah yeah because those guys are they're being paid for uh you know last time i had my car repaired uh even even this car i took it in they said sixty dollars an hour and wow that's as much as i make programming and well i said sixty dollars an hour i mean and i don't even get the sixty i only make i only get the thirty so they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at an hour after they clocked it in huh so they they charged me for two and a half you know basically two and a half hours uh labor an hour later and i asked them about that and they said that's uh yeah oh that's flat rate sir you know that they look it up in the book and if it takes an hour to do something why and they can get it done in thirty minutes why they charge you an hour huh so anyway those that uh in other words there's no there's no benefit for going to a skilled mechanic yeah so uh anyway what i'm looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people yeah and the other thing i'm i guess i'd be looking for is uh um you know mileage counts with me even though i even though i don't drive that much i i like mileage yeah yeah somebody told me uh once the a casual conversation that this guy ran a a towing service and uh and uh i was telling him about you know i was thinking about buying a car and he said you know i he said he he knew it would sound biased but he said that about uh i don't know four out of five cars that he tows are Japanese cars and he said he just he didn't why you know he'd been in the he'd been in the business for awhile and he wasn't sure maybe it was because people who bought those cars you know would would rather have it towed than try some other thing you know like you know having somebody drag it home with a chain  so what do you think about mandatory public service well um um personally i think it's good uh-huh i think um there's a lot of things that that um you can learn from helping other people and doing things that need to be done and as i look around i see most of the things that i enjoy like i just got back from vacation and the freeways were were built by somebody else paid by somebody else and and um wouldn't hurt to do some of that myself right were you ever in the military or public service of any kind i i did a two and a half um two and a half year volunteer um how shall i say it uh service in the Far East for my church oh really yeah what denomination uh Latter Day Saint church uh-huh and um so it was it was um it was a great uh thing and and i know some other people that who've that have um come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about about uh the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well i don't know but in Europe and in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to to uh not necessarily join the military military but have you know mandatory uh volunteer service of some kind right so how about you i think it's also a good idea people that i've i was just thinking this morning about how are you there yes okay hi um i was just thinking this morning about how people tend to get off into a to one narrow track and one narrow focus and don't get an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways of doing things so in particular i was thinking about up in lately visiting around to a lot of different congregations and the preachers that i've heard that have just grown up and stayed into one particular denomination are not nearly as good and um expansive as the ones that have come from a different denomination to the one they're in now so in terms of having life experience and a better appreciation for other people and other points of view i think the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing great idea the problem is that as you say not everybody will have a great experience the ones that are wanting to do it tend to have great experiences though some of our friends that joined the Peace Corps have been really lonely yeah well well that's part of the how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every oh how shall i say it not every uh not every place we go has has great weather i uh you know sometimes you come back and and you say um that was an interesting trip but i guess what i'm saying is that that overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service uh are just infectious they they get you remember the people you helped and it's not all money money money money right and uh it's really useful to to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the Far East i came back and i said well of all the bad things i've done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and haven't done anything at least i've done something for that period of time uh-huh and uh you know it's um how shall i say it it's not a cure all but uh right the other thing that i've that i like i say i feel is that there's a a lot of people out there that that just have tons of time and uh they don't know what they're going to do with their life and and as you pointed out if they've get out and see if uh uh life from a from a different uh perspective then uh they have a better focus uh-huh and and let's see what else i i think the only difficulty is going to be um if it becomes well i think we'd have to learn a lot from the European uh style uh because i know that in America there's sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that that uh it might become  is crime a problem in Arlington uh actually we live out in Gainesville Virginia and uh my wife is originally from the Bronx so for the longest time we didn't have any any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we lived way out in the country here uh-huh and uh then you know over the years we visited her folks and her folks have probably the most impressive crime reduction system i've ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window they have probably three or four dead bolts on every door um just uh an amazing array of um you know sort of security measures on their house i mean it's harder to get into their house than it is probably a lot of minimum security prisons well huh so anyway now she's turning our house into sort of the same thing we have uh we have like grates on the on the uh door on the basement windows even though there's very little crime in this area huh well uh-huh and we just had a a guy come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and uh put new locks in on some doors and fix our French doors up so that they were you know secure yeah so yeah it it's too bad you mentioned uh your in-laws place as as being like a prison in sense of hard to get into or out of or whatever yeah that's what crime is doing in the cities it's turning those that live in the cities into prisoners yeah what's it like in Dallas uh actually i'm in a suburb of Dallas where it's safer in general than it is in the big city uh-huh it um i think it's like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the ones where there's more poverty uh-huh the you know that there's always one part of town right uh whether it's the Bronx or whether it's a certain area in Dallas or whatever uh i i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in Fort Worth a woman was killed and her husband was uh badly injured uh-huh and they've charged the uh the husband's daughter with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her oh man dad and stuff yeah man incredible isn't that incredible and i mean uh that that's crime that's that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps uh attacking attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe it's an armed robber who does it all the time but this is uh yeah yeah yeah it's clearly i i mean it's they're not in category of business criminals i mean there's there's criminals who are in it just because that's their business you know i mean that's their trade essentially and oh yeah yeah you know then there's then there's the really random acts of violence we actually had a a woman who was very close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to you know beef up our own security measures here uh she was a couple of houses away and her husband travels a lot and is gone you know for weeks on end and she was upstairs with her uh child and heard somebody say hello hello from downstairs uh-huh so she immediately calls 911 and the Prince William County police come over and of course the woman kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because you know if you can get 911 Gainesville Virginia you know you're probably you know i mean it's probably a pretty effective thing you know uh-huh um so anyway the police showed up and they told her the person on the phone told her to run you know take the child and run downstairs and to let the police in because they were at her front door uh-huh and so she did that and when she opened the front door she'd just bought this new German Shepherd puppy which had apparently you know uh gone all over the floor so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess oh no and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out which the policeman thought was like somebody's about to shoot me so you know he's like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway when the guy finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of house lady and stop trying to help me but anyway later on it's it's gonna it's uh she they didn't find anything i mean apparently you know if the guy came in he ran out and and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the TV which just doesn't make any sense at all too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over hum about a week later he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about five seconds got into their garage door oh ho  okay how you do you have kids yeah i have a uh twelve year old son and a fourteen year old daughter oh they're just teenagers huh almost right so uh so it's uh an interesting experience for us but we're kind of lucky uh in that regard because uh the church we belong to has a a program that they've had for quite a few years that they call family home evening and that program is designed to uh bring the family together at least once a week on Monday night so we uh i guess i could say religiously dedicate Monday evening to doing just that and each each week uh each one of us takes uh responsibility for that particular Monday night yeah now now do you find that that that's uh see how would i say that do you find that uh that that it's well i mean it's it's that it works you could do that on a Monday on a Monday do you find it that it's easy to do that on Monday nights or is it um-hum it because it turns out that Monday night of all of the other nights of the week generally is the one that has the least number of other outside influences going on so we find that it works out quite well and uh we actually look forward to it because we get to spend so little time together otherwise and uh as i said each one of us'll plan uh something for the particular Monday and it can be anything because it is kind of a a church sponsored thing once in a while we'll have a a religious lesson maybe once a month that alternates amongst us but uh we might go to a movie or we might watch something here or play a game or just sit and read or uh or whatever that individual feels that they would like to do that's what we do oh that sounds pretty good are do you find that that uh uh i guess with us yeah i have uh four kids at home now and um-hum and uh let's see uh a six a five year old a thirteen year old uh excuse me five eleven thirteen and seventeen and uh Saturdays is a is it's difficult to get everybody um-hum organized and rounded up uh so they get the chores done and don't home in on the television immediately when they when they get up right um-hum um actually and during the school nights uh um uh the we have a rule now that that uh because the kids are so easily distracted by the you know right uh that uh no television on school nights and no um-hum hum and right not at all or until it's all done or uh none at all not at all that's that's a good but uh that's a good idea but it's well they think it's draconian they think it's terrible you know right yeah hard to enforce i'm sure uh well no it's not that hard to enforce it's just uh because if there's you know if it's hum i found out that if if uh if i let one of them watch pretty soon they'd all be watching um-hum that's right including yourself yeah can't let yourself watch either that'll work so i so i said that well no television and no ball games and the reason no ball games is because the kids'll stick their earphones on and and listen to ball games and try and do their piano believe it or not um-hum right we have another uh another advantage to is that uh three of the four of us are ham radio operators oh is that that's that's a pretty good hobby isn't it yeah so we have a uh a hobby in common and we can talk to one another over the air too on uh on many occasions and uh matter of fact we're my son and i are watching the the shuttle right now uh they've got four ham radio operators on board the shuttle and uh so we been trying to make contact with them and it's uh it's headed towards the DC area right now yeah matter of fact it's uh it's over the horizon now oh is that right that's very nice well now that's kind of that's interesting to me because a lot of uh you know in keeping on the uh the family thing here the reason that's interesting is because i've noticed that some families have um-hum um like the the parent i knew some ham and uh um-hum uh there's a tendency and i i think a lot of it depends on the family for like the ham to go in his in his uh room and shut the door right in the ham shack um hum in a shack and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded right and that's the last you ever see of him and uh and that's and uh he speaks a totally different language and the fact that and i read one time that uh there was a high divorce rate in in uh Cape Canaveral down there or Cape Kennedy or whatever you call it because the engineer would come home go in his study close the door and that was it uh-huh right uh-huh and uh just sort of an autocrat so the fact that you've got three participants in your family that uh that do that is that's a credit to you what are hum let's say i i guess my other question about uh hum um when it comes to when they're on their own you know i mean if if you have to go if you and your wife go someplace um-hum what typically  what kind of pollution do you have in Flagstaff well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that uh too much uh but uh uh-huh we have a lot of wood smoke uh here now i heat with wood so ah and i'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a source a source of pollution but there are people in this community who who think that uh it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution and and uh we're very close to the uh to the Grand Canyon uh-huh where air pollution is a very big issue because on of pollution well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the Los Angeles area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the Four Corners power plant up near Page Arizona uh uh-huh but because it's a national park that's a a big issue there uh here in Flagstaff actually uh it it's something that's unique to us the the biggest pollutant that we have in our air is cinder dust i'll be darned and that's because uh we're in a volcanic region and we uh we have dirt roads uh in a lot of areas that are covered with with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time uh-huh in place of uh using salt or substances like that that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of um-hum you know the largest the largest quantity that's the biggest pollutants that we have to to deal with here yeah well i i'm sure that cinder dust is pretty unique um in the Dallas area of course the the biggest issue of air pollution is just automobiles yes uh we don't have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that um which are not typically bad polluters right but um so i i'd think you'd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here does does Dallas sits sit in any kind of uh uh i've been there but i don't remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that uh where you get temperature inversions that that capture air pollutants or anything like that we have we yes we occasionally have them not if they're not not not too significant but they do occasionally occasionally occur uh one source of pollution for us is the dust and sand in uh west Texas sure in the spring time we'll have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas i'm serious these enormous clouds of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it i laugh because i made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas and then continuing east uh to the Eastern Coast of the United States and uh i joked that uh all of the settlers uh-huh settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but as long as long only as long as you take west Texas too yeah okay all right i can understand that it's interesting though that you mentioned the uh wood stoves yes i grew up in New Mexico and but that was long enough ago that uh people didn't really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will um-hum uh but now in New Mexico heating with with particularly pinon pine is really an issue right and not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many many years to grow those trees yes and and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them um and it's it's such a distinctive smell when it burns i had forgotten it i mean i it it's one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mother's house you go oop yep somebody's burning pinon here in Flagstaff uh juniper is the the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke uh and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on on air pollution uh-huh is that uh we're surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world uh-huh but people don't wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood oh sure and uh aspen uh it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat uh and and ponderosa we also have pinon but uh it uh it it like ponderosa is very dirty um-hum and so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine and the forest service is really saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it uh less of a  actually i don't have much recent experience uh but i have done uh a variety of fishing probably the most favorite uh was when i was of youth um probably in the ages ten to fifteen when i went out with my dad uh we lived in we lived on the uh southeast coast of Florida about a mile from the ocean we went out off the coast of Fort Lauderdale Miami okay in uh small boat with a small outboard motor yeah went out a mile two miles three miles sometimes and bottom fished and uh and got lots of fish very rapidly basically went out to a reef and uh which probably about oh ten fathoms or something like that and uh and we just pull up fish usually pull up fish as fast as you could let your line down yeah and sometimes uh had some fun uh with trigger fish that would follow other fish up and then then you'd catch the trigger fish right at the surface occasional shark or an occasional octopus things of that nature but yeah that must have been neat with octopus yeah well that was pretty rare you know but every once in a while you'd get something like that yeah yeah most of i haven't really done any like like you said in awhile it's uh most of my favorite fishing was before i came in the service and that was trout fishing up in Wyoming i see and we went out to a lot of lakes and the streams and stuff and went fishing i did some fly fishing and stuff in the streams and that that's pretty fun doing fly fishing now where do you do uh trout fishing in Wyoming a lot of most of the lakes up there have rainbow trout in them or brook trout i see so you would fish in the lake yeah and the fly fishing is in the stream or what yeah in the in the stream or a river you know uh what if you got a pretty good if you know it has to be probably knee deep or a little deeper for you know in a creek before you can really do any good fishing um you fish from the bank or do you wade a lot of times just fish from the bank um unless you get a good spot spot in the corner you can kind of wade out a little bit but most of my fishing was done from the bank um but it it was pretty fun uh i've caught a three four pound trout before and that's pretty good size trout oh yeah um i've caught some we got one reservoir up there that has some walleye in it and i caught some of them where abouts in Wyoming is this uh up near Devil's Tower northeast corner i see uh and oh we went to Florida where my grandfather lives we went out and did some uh fishing out in the ocean so that was pretty neat too where abouts is this uh Sarasota i see that's quite different from the east coast the the the uh gulf coast uh you have to go out like maybe ten or twenty miles before you get more than knee deep almost yeah whereas on the east coast uh you go out a mile and you're already uh five ten fathoms down yeah it it was it's pretty good though you know some of the bays are you know a little deep you know where they come in and stuff but hm uh it it was uh an experience you know because he had his own boat so what did you what did you get there off Sarasota uh i'm not really sure what they called it uh i don't even remember it's been such a long time what i was catching have you ever been sport fishing no i haven't i'd like to do that sometime i've never been sport fishing the closest i've come is to is uh go out on party boats drift fishing yeah yeah which is pretty nice we did that in New Jersey not too many years ago and uh did it just at the right time and we got into just schools and schools of blue fish big ones about they each one weighed about ten pounds yeah yeah you know they were about like uh three four feet long oh that pretty good size oh yeah yeah that was really uh really i guess they may be about three feet long not four but um um that was something they really fought like yeah you like nothing nothing else i'd ever had yeah i've watched a lot of them sport fishing things on TV you know where they're out in the deep sea fishing hm  the best to do for voting well i think that uh i guess i just everybody knows that education is is important but i guess the main thing is there's some things you just don't care about so if you don't care about them you don't vote for them right one of the biggest stumbling block is at first getting registered yeah although although uh that's there's a lot of people out there that'll do that for you that i just thought of something now that that made a big difference to me and uh come to think of it it's got to do with Jerry Brown and that's when i was in i used to live in California and when he was Secretary of State there one of the things that he did was he sent out a booklet and the booklet was uh here are the issues here's the pros here's the cons here's the pro rebuttal to the cons and here's the con rebuttal to the pros by the time i got through reading that article by the time i got through reading that booklet i knew exactly what the issues were isn't that what you have now in Oregon you have the booklets well we had a little booklet and it says here's the issues yep and each uh party or whatever against or for the proposition or but for fifty bucks you can or whatever it is fifty or three hundred or five hundred or something like that you can put in a statement for or against but the nice thing about this other thing was that and was that you have uh like i say you have the people say well it's going to uh it's gonna reduce taxes and the other people say yeah it'll reduce taxes but at the expense of something else and so it was how shall i say it it was kind of focused pros and the cons and then the rebuttal and so i got to see both sides whereas in the current booklet it just says here's uh if somebody thinks it's a good idea he tells me but you know it's are you uh are you involved in software excuse me are you an engineer or or involved in software at all oh well that yeah okay well one of the things about a lot of programs is they tell you what they do but they don't tell you what they don't do and the only way you know what i mean they say oh look this is great this this slices slices bread but they don't tell you that that it also mashes it at the same time and uh so that uh-huh yeah i i i understand to giving pros and cons and being informed but yeah i thinking also uh you can you should have voter registration by phone things like that well out here they do it by uh mail you can do it by mail that yeah well you you know a lot of places do it by mail but a lot of people don't but you know get to the step of putting it into the mail you know and uh if you can do it from the phone and pick it up at anytime twenty four hours a day and do it that's that'll make well the problem with that i think is fraud we haven't been around voter fraud uh too much but well well actually there's there are ways i mean if they can get the speaker identity verification and those kind of technologies out there it would help um you know in terms of verifying who they are and what they're saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldn't you just walk up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay you've already voted where do you live yeah and all that stuff yeah they don't do that which is a problem and uh i don't know i think um that or you can also the problem is also oh motivating people to do it seeing that their voting has an impact on the process and people frankly don't see any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they don't do anything so there's learned helplessness type of you know no matter what i do it's not gonna help so why bother that's that's certainly true too um there's uh the other side of the coin is that uh in the educational side the IRS does a wonderful job right about now at putting articles in the paper about uh motivating motivating people to turn in their taxes um-hum uh and i don't think the that very many people try to motivate you to to vote um-hum well they should i you know what i think also they should do is build in the process the election process uh is not just vote getting i mean to get those people candidates saying that not that their votes aren't any good unless they also motivate so many percent of the populace to vote they could be identified by them oh i see what you're saying so put it in the political process that that you know not only you have to get petitions in order to get on the ballot but you have to attract you know you have to attract so many people just to come to vote they don't have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually vote you know those something built in to the system to motivate people to to bring them into the process and especially the people who wanna hold office i mean that's what  any uh child care situations or experiences i i have had um i did a stint as a single parent for awhile and my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school and i thought that that was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would fill those small time slots early in the morning and after school what you were left with were uh high school girls or boys right and uh never mind that they had all those noble uh qualities like you know you know the same philosophy of raising children that you did you were probably lucky to get anybody because you weren't paying them very much and uh it was just a short period of time so indeed yeah uh it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch TV with them it it wasn't the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had small children and you had child raising thoughts in mind it was kind of a temporary um babysitting kind of thing have you dealt with that yeah right well i've got three kids the oldest is nine and the youngest is three and we have actually a live in child care worker here that we you know a nanny that lives here and that makes it very easy for us oh are you pleased with the situation yeah we've had um we're on our um our third our second our our second long-term person you know it's been just about two years for each of the two people that we've had hm and prior to that we had you know to take child care we took the kids to somebody else's home and that worked out okay but it wasn't that great it wasn't convenient well we you know it was just it was partly the convenience and partly you know the woman the women that took care of our kids also had kids of their own and the households were a little hectic you know how it sometimes is hm i understand from people who have live in help au pairs and and you know just people who live with them that very often you end up involved in their personal problems and they're taking care of your kids and you're taking care of them do you find that oh yes definitely without a doubt i'm you know it's like having a a a young adult in the family just about uh-huh but that's okay i mean you you know as long as as their problems don't get too far out of hand well you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then it's a problem to wean them off them a little bit of a problem but you know that's just reality of it and you know you have to work with them and tell them ahead of time that somebody's leaving and somebody else is gonna be coming in and help them adjust to the situation how old are the kids oh the youngest is three and the oldest is nine and the middle one is six and the after school school situation is great it's really convenient to have somebody whose job it is to make sure they're that they get home and and you know are taken care of properly hm i imagine that is a luxury of sorts oh yeah it it's expensive it'll it'll probably have to change when they get you know all old enough to go to school have to use some after school service our local YMCA has something like that uh-huh have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want your children raised what your philosophies are but it well yeah to a certain extent um i guess you know my wife does more of that sort of i mean she she and the and the caretaker have intense discussions about that and i suppose i'm sort of a slug for not getting more involved but that's the way it is you just appreciate the situation oh oh it works out pretty well i think it's a good plan um i think it's kind of disgraceful that it's so hard for so many people well i you know i think this the thing is um your situation is what i would call ideal but it's probably taking both you working you know you and your wife working to afford this person isn't that so well yeah oh no doubt if one of us got laid off she'd be gone in two seconds i'm afraid i'm or have to right when i was home by myself and i had a uh an eight year old and a six year old um there aren't that many choices and that's the scary part you're just happy to get someone you know you really are in such desperate need and if your child's sick there's the panic it's like i can't stay home what do i do and you know you import grandma from the other town to come over it was an emergency you know Christmas vacation comes around and then you've got to fill in that block of time oh we've got those situations and you know we've got to deal with that kind of stuff but but it's absolutely you know situation like ours you know where we could make enough money to cover it properly you know both we both work and then we pay the pay the nanny and we pay the compensation workers compensation insurance and we pay the the withholding taxes we  um anyway we're supposed talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing so um i don't know Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county um oh they did they had been doing it they started first in Sarasota City um you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually and um they've got these i don't know what if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all um-hum yeah not quite no they've got these on it's it's county wide program now and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash um-hum uh-huh plastic cans cans and glass okay and then uh paper okay which in the paper it's just um newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there no slicks um yeah okay oh that's that's good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it yeah okay see that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly but when i lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there and they'd just sort it out for you it was really pretty good if you're lazy like i am so um-hum yeah yeah yeah right well you know um i talked to this girl who um she's a an an acquaintance of mine and and she's involved with uh oh what is the name of that company it's not Amway but it's the other big vitamin company Shaklee oh okay yeah okay and um and and she's just Shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything and um you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it's a little extra work and uh yeah right uh-huh it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got it can yeah okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container right um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long yeah you got to tie them up and everything and right this is a little container and they have another one the same size that one's red and then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods uh-huh uh-huh and so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem so not only do you exactly it is you know big hassle yeah yeah that's true i mean up here they give you one one of those containers and you put everything in it um-hum so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know let's say if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend um-hum it's gonna be hard pressed to pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place you know so it's kind of a pain in the butt this is true this is true but um i don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have have those garbage people that make how every many make twenty twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting um-hum you know and and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient but i yeah they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here um if you wanna have a nice garbage can you know and it's on wheels and it's big yeah oh you can actually rent those yeah okay that's interesting yeah up here the the city provides them kind of like yeah well i think in i think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them oh okay so and they just add it on to your water bill or something so where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota are you north of Sarasota or east of Sarasota um-hum east okay and Sarasota is on the west coast yeah okay like south of Tampa right yeah okay i'm yeah about an hour about an hour south of Tampa yeah that's right okay um yeah well i i listen to this talk radio station down here and it's it's really they they i don't if you ever listen to talk radio but um occasionally those guys they just kind of get into to stewing stewing stewing up trouble you know with the callers and things like that but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know and some of it sometimes it's serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and yeah yeah so i'm listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now uh-huh and it's like um  uh so where do you stand on gun control where do i stand well if uh if ten means absolutely no control i don't think i'd buy that but i guess i'd be maybe a six i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible uh i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets but i don't think anybody has the right to tell me i can't possess one i don't think uh if i'm responsible my kids can't get a hold of them and i certainly wouldn't use them for a crime i think the people who do use them for crime aren't the people who bother to get a a license yeah uh what are your feelings i'm i'm more in favor of of uh restricting them but um as far as getting a number it's a little hard but yeah i it it is a uh just picking it out of a hat um but do you feel that no one should be able to own any no no no cause people like to hunt and and some you know in some cases i think it's it's a good um i mean it's a valid reason to have one for defense although you know the statistics about uh accidents uh it's kind of uh worrisome i mean i wouldn't i know i don't like the idea of having guns around a lot because they're mostly used i mean to they cause a lot of accidents they there are a lot of accidents because of them being so handy okay well i don't know what the laws are in your state uh in order to get a license i was uh thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved um-hum um you need all kinds of references you need they check your criminal record and all this other stuff uh they restrict i'm not sure um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license hm um i myself am no fool i didn't want to hurt myself why would anybody want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a uh National Rifle Association course on no how to uh handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else um i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no hm no thought to use it for protection i you know i'm more more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me um um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i don't believe that there should be that you should be able to walk into your local supermarket and buy one i mean any bozo could get one then and then it would be indeed scary no uh i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target it's the kind it's sort of like weight lifting it's something that you can judge yourself against yourself uh-huh and uh i i i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really revolting i mean i personally can't even see hunting you know i have no use for Bambi there yeah it's it's kind of brutal right but i mean we we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget i'm a hypocrite myself oh yeah uh what what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained does does that revolt you in any way no i've i've actually done that with a friend of mine with his gun uh-huh uh and he did you feel unsafe no no the uh the thing is if when if i have one handy though then if i'm or i can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying uh i just i want to go for the gun i know where it is it's easy and then then it's too late pulling the trigger is so easy that uh well well you know it i think it's it it i think uh you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a gun i should have a gun and nobody else should because i know i would act responsibly but you you never know about the other guy and i think that's part of the reason why people are are so fearful right right uh-huh because it's true someone might get drunk and not think um right right you know i don't believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing but well that's how i feel so uh in Massachusetts they uh they have uh uh  all right are you a music fan oh by all means various types um my tastes range from rock and roll to classical in fact about the only type of music that i really find offensive would be uh country western oh is that right yeah i take that back rap but i consider rap music to be an oxymoron yeah i guess i i'll have to agree with you on rap uh that's uh it's not my that's not my style my uh yeah let's let's see one more question here do you uh do you play an instrument yes i do i play two a bass guitar and kalimba okay so that's i used to play three which was the clarinet but i've that's since gone into disuse well now there's there's multiple kinds of country western music uh not that i'm an expert in that uh area but yeah well there was rockabilly in the fifties and that's what gave rise to like Carl Perkins uh Jerry Lee Lewis uh Elvis Presley in the beginning but there's yeah right and that type of music i do appreciate it had some it had it had the spark of creativity it was it was out there yeah and uh since then it's sort of fallen into formula and i guess that's my thing is i have a problem with formula music now is is uh i guess the other thing that that uh there there is one kind of music that i don't know i wouldn't consider it country western but but it is in a sense huh and that's bluegrass what about that well i've only been exposed to that minimally and that's usually through occasional you know viewings of concerts of said type on public television okay you know did you watch the the did did you watch it for very long or was it just oh it was something i had basically for background it was not uh obtrusive oh okay it was something i could listen to and uh and do my chores around the house okay so you listen to it i i mean it's not oh yes it not it's not completely offensive it's not offensive to you is what i'm yeah oh that's that's interesting my uh there for uh a long time uh i i liked folk music but uh folk music is you know a a back in the seventies uh-huh yeah so to speak sixties and seventies and then sure and uh then i became a a bluegrass fan and i listened to it all the time and i've got lots of tapes of it and then uh-huh uh i like but i'm kind of like you i i i mean in some ways i'm like you i i don't uh uh i don't like music that it's this uh where you where you know what the next phrase is going to be because you know they have these dumb rhymes like a lot of i mean the where the how shall i say it the words are just so predictable uh-huh yeah and although i do laugh at some of the country western things they have this one uh country western song about the guy the perfect country western song and he said it had to have trains and all that stuff trains and mama i don't know if you've heard that one oh that that that's cute i would've liked to have heard that and then he uh basically said okay so i went back to him and finally it what he came up with was the song about uh his mom got hit by a train and and uh she or it was the day she got out of jail she got hit by a train and and things like that so you know and anyways went to see her in his pickup truck and stuff like that so it was kind of creative i like that but uh oh yeah had to have some beer too or or some sort of alcoholic substance yeah but uh the thing one of the things that that the northwest i've been told has has got a lot of uh it's kind of the center of activity is uh uh i don't know if you would call it new wave music or or uh new age music i is that it new age yes yeah George Winston and which is he's a little bit uh uh well he's kind of the recognized uh i don't know if he's the founder of it but huh yeah it's like the Windham Hill stuff it's it's but they yeah Windham Hill yeah it's uh new age classical so to speak yes well what i what i often uh call air pudding yeah now they have some of that uh uh some of it's very interesting and other and and others uh is how shall i say it it's very predictable now that's interesting you'd say the air pudding some people would call it yuppie music yeah yeah well i only use it when i'm studying and that's the extent of it it's just it's good background filter stuff and you know it what it is it's pleasant but it's not talent in in my view it's not genius um when i really wish to get into listening pleasure uh with something of that nature i put on Mozart or Beethoven something that will evoke a response something that almost reaches in and and hits those proverbial heart strings the i i can respond to that a little bit by uh i spent three years in the Far East and of course the some of the i mean what kids uh  i haven't done any camping lately how about you oh not recently we we've done a little bit of car camping uh since since i got married and did a little bit of backpacking several years ago but uh not recently were these extended trips or just a weekend or well not real long maybe three four days at the most how about you uh that's about what i've done but it goes back even further to my childhood camping went out camping and and the purpose was not to camp the purpose was to fish um-hum um-hum and there were no motels in in the wilds of New Mexico so if you wanted to go fish for a few days you would uh and at certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track you would do what you i think what you call car camping right i mean the car's there and and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside of it or inside the car or but uh nothing too elaborate in the way of tents and um-hum i've actually even slept on the ground yeah well i've done a little bit of that too um i guess i've kind of done the full range of camping anywhere from backpacking in the mountains for for a week at a time to the the car camping kind of thing where did you do your backpacking well i've done some down in um Tennessee and Kentucky that area North Carolina and then done some in New Mexico and some out in Montana Colorado so i've kind of gone around and done it number of places but this was in years past or yeah right i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um the emphasis there was on backpacking exclusively around Philmont or something right um-hum you've been there no i haven't no but every Boy Scout i've ever known has camped at Philmont um-hum yeah yeah well it's a very popular place and i worked there three summers so got to know it pretty well yeah i guess i don't know do you think it's it's as safe as it used to be to go camping well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um cause a lot of times we'd just pull water out of a stream and um use that and i was never really big on using a lot of chemicals for water purification and treatment um and nowadays i think i'd be a little bit more cautious about that than i used to be yeah when when i was in growing up in New Mexico if we went on a picnic or whatever it was always in the mountains we lived in the southwestern corner of the state so we could go to the mountains or the desert just pick a place and if you were needed water the you'd find a stream and drink right out of the stream um-hum when i left New Mexico and moved to Missouri i would not have dreamed drinking out of any stream that i saw there right so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is um-hum but uh course i i mean even in in New Mexico you always had the possibility of a cow or uh some other critter upstream a ways from you um-hum um what about crime in camp sites do you think that's a problem well i suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an issue but generally i haven't ever found that to be a problem usually people are very friendly and um cooperative all the way around so i've never deemed that as a threat to myself but yeah been been fairly careful about not leaving tempting things out in the campsite and stuff like that oh yeah yeah it you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all that sort of stuff don't tempt people um-hum right and usually if i'm backpacking of course there i don't worry about it much at all because if there's something there that they want they'd have to haul it out a long ways so they usually would think twice about it that's right so i have a good friend who goes backpacking about twice a year in the Grand Canyon um-hum he's he's really uh hung up on that Grand Canyon you know i've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but there's something about going down in a hole that just um doesn't really relate that strongly to me i suppose i'll try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something yeah yeah i i think with the case like in the case of the canyon you see more from the rim than you would ever camping down inside of it um-hum yeah are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to go out and climb or well no it's more mostly just some rolling hills so there isn't really much  well all right um i i guess i'll start um by mentioning that um being twenty four years old i had a great-grandmother who's still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my great-grandfather and it was a real problem in doing that because uh she has Alzheimer's um-hum um-hum and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less hm and passed on only only about a week after that well my um my my grandmother is um had Alzheimer's and through the process we had to remove we tried to keep her at home at our we had to remove her from her home because she was getting paranoiac and tried to keep her at our home and did that as long as we could but again the process is very difficult even even you know i think that my parents did a good job at it when when they went through but it's not an easy thing when they've got Alzheimer's but my other grandparents um signed up for a retirement type thing in Pennsylvania um already my father's much older than my mother so well no i guess it anyway my grandparents my other grandparents are much younger and um they what they did is they sold their house and bought a house figuratively speaking in this retirement complex and they live in that house and there there there's minimal because they you know they bought it um they've kind of bought into the whole system and there's there's care given for the lawn and stuff um-hum and um as they get older more care can be given and there's some minimal fees that they'll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of and when they get too old they can move into an apartment instead it's like a duplex they have now yeah well they can move into an apartment and then later nursing we had yeah we had up here when they got into uh when my grandmother came over my great-grandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in um-hum because we simply we couldn't handle it she kind of she'd lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around uh we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or uh you know it was incredible because my great-grandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned yeah everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my grandfather great-grandfather we had never realized how much um how bad she had deteriorated over the uh years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didn't realize the extent until after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke and um um we had her here and we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little crazy yeah that's what happened to my other my grandmother my grandfather had died and she wanted to stay on and then she got Alzheimer's and it was a really hard thing for the whole family i'm much more appreciative of what my yeah my other set of grandparents has done and my parents have already um kind of like gone on a waiting list cause it's such a long thing because it preserves the dignity of the you know the whole situation and it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on our resources because it'll mean just yeah um you know sell selling their house now and buying into that at the same time and it's familiar yeah my my great-grandfather my great-grandfather had found uh my great-grandfather was was was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything um-hum and and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didn't wanna lose the independence and yeah uh that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of long-term well we didn't catch it for my first grandmother my first set of grandparents but my other grandparents had apparently it's like a retirement community and they knew a lot of friends who had done the same thing and when they got there yeah
