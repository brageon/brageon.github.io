 okay i'll let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours no i i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible um-hum well that's that's good especially for these times and uh and it's it's sort sort of always worked uh-huh uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can i guess have self control well that's a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didn't keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she won't quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system um-hum where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what she's buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period uh-huh if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about um-hum yes and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month well yeah i i couldn't probably be bothered doing doing that uh-huh that's what i mean it was a hassle every month and and every since uh well we've been married almost thirty years now but um my my husband got paid once a month um-hum um-hum so you learn to get through you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh that's that's kind of hard but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldn't like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way don't you no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isn't anything left to spend anyway right right well that's true what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely um-hum and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month well yeah we we tried to to and to or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didn't pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is yeah we're not there yet um-hum uh-huh that's right that's right and for most of uh i mean i'm a substitute teacher and i've only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so there's only been really one working and uh um um-hum same here yeah it it works for me but i can't see that it it would work for probably the majority of people well i could say it's kind of you know that's that's good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what i'm saying and so that that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday yeah then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener um-hum yeah um-hum it it is when you do it that way uh-huh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're gonna spend going out for fun this is how much you're gonna spend it's kind of hard do you well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldn't you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks yeah yeah right right oh how nice ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the what minuscule amount i made but that way you just didn't put it on your credit card and and it was paid for uh-huh with well that's good and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah yes and so i think that that's difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um i think so too so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that that's excellent that's what i'm working toward i think you're probably much ahead of me there and i'm working on it yes and i never worried about saving money because we just we're in the savings plan at work and they took it out so same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get you know yeah i uh um-hum well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh yeah that came up yeah and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my we're looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars uh-huh and they were mainly used cars well that's the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after so yeah so you know we've been rather rather frugal in that rather frugal well that that's gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess we've completed do you think we've been here ten in that respect yeah well each each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh  so do you have any recycling programs there um i don't really think we have anything in the works as of yet uh we're pretty small town and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of Wal-Mart uh-huh oh uh-huh that show you know plastics paper yeah liter bottles et cetera et cetera we've progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town yeah it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins um-hum and it's just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump yeah and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper and um you know all those things that aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin oh and uh i guess you can also and a lot of the restaurants yeah they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh huh oh i don't know i guess they're you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated yeah and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos yeah uh and they have those strategically strategically placed around the city oh and uh they're they're actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh oh that'd be good yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary yeah see it's not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans oh yeah but that's as far as we go because i take them to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just uh-huh i can do that for her and and i don't want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it yeah oh really hm yeah see we don't have anything here in Belton it's it's a pretty small little town yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh yeah so yeah that's about all that that we're doing here uh they're uh getting a little bit more on they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you can't because uh-huh you know not a lot of people do really know what you know yeah they're doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper what it's for yeah and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and it's uh i think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and it's almost uh i don't know if it's done by a private company or not it may be um-hum but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up wow that's excellent that's good yeah let's see oh and every year of course the phone books yeah um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins oh because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city they're pretty thick and and sometimes you might have two or three yeah they uh exactly so uh that's that's a big savings right there in itself yeah see ours just goes in the regular trash it just you know there's not a whole lot and there are you know some places that yeah hm we'll set up you know for old newspapers and stuff but usually it's um-hum it it hasn't caught on yet i'm hoping it will soon um-hum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive yeah so when you see something that's on recycled paper they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that it's uh they're not coming out ahead at all it's uh it's really a cost hm i wasn't totally aware of that yeah so i mean it it sounds good to the public but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i don't know they may be coming out ahead yeah but i know for a fact that the paper uh on that end they're not you know it's it's good to recycle but it's uh not to their advantage and it costs less yeah hm well i can't think of anything else okay i can't either because we're we're at a very you know beginning stages so uh-huh we look forward to it to get better but that's it well i hope y'all um uh come along a little farther in the future yeah me too it was nice talking to you bye-bye you too bye  how would you go about organizing a family reunion well i from i grew up in the Deep South like south Alabama so whenever i think of family reunions my family like got together almost every week oh gee and there'd be like thirty people so people talk about you know big family reunions and i i think like i have a friend who just went to like Wyoming to some big ranch you know where like there were four hundred people oh my for for their family reunion and i so i mean how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives uh-huh because i since i came from my father has uh five sisters and two brothers and my mother has four brothers and two sisters so i can both of my parents had big families and we always were we always got together just always now it's different because i live here and i've you know when i go home i try to see the families as much of the family as i can but it's real different and i grew up in a real not i think not normal setting yes with all of you living so close together right i mean Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's and you know like i said there'd be thirty you know a thirty people and everyone would just bring things and my grandmother would cook and cook and cook and oh it well i come from a very small family and we planned a family reunion this spring um where we are from Texas and my family's from Ohio and we met in Florida um-hum so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together so that's all the family so planning our family reunion reunion was very easy yeah i guess so and sounds like it was fun yeah it was we had a wonderful time  what is it about nursing homes um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother yeah um-hum and they're just really close here and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her right and um and i i it's hard to be a caretaker i really believe it's really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day oh it's very difficult i know uh it she has Alzheimer's and does not remember uh a lot if anything and so she asks the same questions over and over again um-hum um-hum which is not unrealistic you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question right yeam uh i i some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented yeah how old is she she's ninety two uh my see my father is ninety two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and oh well i think that's wonderful and do the whole thing but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then i don't know what i'll do up there i i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so well um-hum yeah i was just gonna say they're in Missouri and i could i i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they can't take the proper care of them most of them yeah um and uh it's it's tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh don't have a place really don't have a place to go yes uh i think it's wonderful these these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily but they can and reside there like little apartment places in between places so right and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves um yeah there's one very close to where my parents are but uh i think it would be nice but my dad's the type he wouldn't wanna spend the money on anything so uh i mean he's from that old depression era and uh you know it's oh it's just blissful that they're both able to do everything for themselves yeah yeah yeah i would imagine that i'll uh if something happens i'll move one of them or both you know in in with me um-hum so uh but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and but i think you'd have to really they also wanted us to talk about you'd have to really check on the uh yeah nursing homes on this this homes but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a i think you just have to drop in all uh unexpectedly a lot visit uh-huh and so many people when they put people in a nurses home they never see them they don't go and see them that's right that's right they never go to see them i've talked to many uh owners of places and say that nobody even maybe maybe Christmas you know um i i think nursing homes are our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children um-hum right oh i do too um or if if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so right right uh because i know Governor Richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes homes uh regulation in Texas so maybe we'll get it improved um-hum i hope so you know it's i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice so anyway right to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know i'm sure that it is just you know you'd pull them out of there so fast oh it's tough i'm sure oh right it'd be devastating i'm sure so and uh and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't it's a very very hard decision i think it is a tough decision and it's one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably um-hum i think that's right and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment yeah right now i know a friend of mine who had a father um she brought to her home um to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out um-hum and that might be a partial solution or something but um right i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever i would hope we could do that and then go from there yeah well anyway well i i think we kind of are along the same lines we've covered a little bit and uh it's good to hear from you and good to hear from you have a lovely day have a good have a good life  question was on lawn and garden work um how do you like it well i don't do much of it here i'm from uh Texas from uh Colorado originally and there are no bugs there and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there but boy i'll tell you what once i see these bugs around here i'm just kind of out of it ooh what kind do you have oh roaches and oh yes cockroaches are awful here just awful so i do they really oh oh and i know somebody that lives there and they never mentioned that problem oh you're kidding you're kidding no it's a well maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here and uh oh my they probably just take it for granted then it it must be if they lived here a lot of people i know just say oh i just stomp on them it doesn't matter they make good fertilizer in the garden me personally can't ooh yuck no i i don't have that problem uh it's mine is mainly we kind of have an understanding that uh i i said i'll do inside work you do outside work uh-huh and so i get into the gardening part of it the fun part like putting in the annuals and things like that but i don't like i don't getting dirty uh-huh no i have to you know i have to say that's not exactly my favorite thing either really no i don't know we got the we got the question and i thought oh this is gonna be interesting uh two bits i'll get a man to talk to because they get stuck doing it all but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home so um we've been fighting a drought here this summer and getting into fall today we just had hm a lot of rain yeah so it's kind of nice i don't know how yours has been oh really well it's been real hot here lately i mean we've had to actually have the air conditioning on and everything but uh it's supposed to rain again now uh this weekend oh i see okay well we're we're leaving tomorrow and we're going down to New Orleans and from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie this is gonna be a switch for us for a week so then yeah going down there and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity but um as far as the gardening and things like that goes i don't know uh yeah too much too much about uh how much i really really do enjoy it myself do you like it at all i well not here i mean it's just here i just can't stand to even get out in the uh in the dirt just well how about when you were in Colorado well i liked it a little bit but i didn't uh i was working at that time full time and didn't have a lot of time for that and so that i think really um uh-huh hampered it a little bit well and then and too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was high and uh if you have that on regular basis in Texas i think i would go with something very dry to keep keep it off you know yeah but uh and with children um you probably don't have time anyhow to to get into it no not really i'm fine it's so uh okay very good i guess we've kind of covered our subject matter since neither one's really into gardening are we sounds like it no no afraid not hopefully they'll get a subject i like one of these times something i really know a lot about well it's nice nice talking to you right okay right nice talking with you um-hum bye okay bye-bye  yeah are you there yes okay do you know the question for today uh yes it's about why there aren't more people that are voting and participating in and what is your feeling do you think this is vital importance oh absolutely okay do you um i think that uh it's kind of discouraging to um i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea you know even there's there's an election or and these are people that are registered i it i have worked in some campaigns and it's the most discouraging thing in the world i'm originally from Oklahoma and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister and i have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation i don't know well that's a thought well can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people hm i don't know i i like that idea um oh i had a though just a second ago but it slipped my mind um oh that's it's one thing that i that i think probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates and i think sometimes you know that's one thing that i have learned in working working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like i know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for and when they got in office it was just a disaster well uh and and i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them i'm i'm i'm not sure the only thing is if they don't vote they have no right to complain absolutely it is um i don't know why we are so complacent but i'm gonna vote each time right or wrong i'm gonna cast a ballot and then if i'm unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion that's right so uh there was something else i was gonna and i'm like you i've just lost a train of thought that i had but they have been more little more effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it now if you just lose if you just skip one election no three you have to you have to skip three three um-hum and um course those can be they can be oh a long time apart but um i think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it of course what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting no excuse i i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that or not okay i'm sure all over the state of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting um-hum and you don't have to have be sick out of town or anything there there is no excuse anyone can go and vote oh i think that's great uh do you actually you know my husband has run for office before and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if you're gonna be tied up that day uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and but that is an excuse and that would i could live with um-hum but this idea of anyone well i just i am so bitterly opposed to this if you're busy that has always been a legitimate excuse um-hum if you are incapacitated ill health but to have the expense of let's see they have five six people at my polling place they can come from all over the city and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this well hopefully once they have uh you know once they've checked them off the list they they do have to check them off a list yes i know when they vote so hopefully they couldn't but is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a you know we back in it when i lived  um i don't i i am only twenty eight and i haven't had much experience with nursing homes i don't i have never visited any i don't think i've ever even been in one have you um actually i have um i've i've been in them but um just visiting and um we used to go when we're like in in our teenagers we'd go on Sundays and visit you know the older people but um i have a elderly grandmother that lives with us uh-huh and she's lived with us for like five years so i kind of know how it is to have to decide if you wanna put somebody in a rest home or um like we i mean we've had those discussions you know about should we put her in or because she's pretty senile and and it takes it takes a lot of care like twenty four hours a day someone has to be well like there's someone in my my fiance's family his grandmother too and they're yeah it's really that his her son his uncle whatever you know anyway he he has he recently retired and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke and and all the other children um are working or whatever they're all my parent's age and uh so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a um-hum day care two days a week they call it senior citizen day care but she goes to the senior citizen center oh really so she he gets a break two days a week but it's only for like two or three hours at a time um-hum and you know just you see a lot of things like you you know was always a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now right but he refuses to consider any other i i don't know yeah and is that how your parents feel or to put her in a rest home um well see it's more of my grandma that feels that way she says that when her husband died that he said uh-huh oh that my uncle had said that he would never have put her in a rest home so it's kind of uh i don't know i don't think my parents would but she is getting pretty bad like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed it's and my mom has to take care of her pretty much so uh-huh it gets i don't know it's it's a hard decision but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally i know at this i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either you know but i i really feel bad for the people i see that not very i'm not really really experienced but like i said just have that one family and that's really so bad for the guy who his whole life is different now and than he thought it would be but when he retired yeah and he's got you know seven brothers and sisters and and uh he's the one because he's the one that doesn't going to work everyday and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone and yeah and it's worked out good for us just because my uncle and my and my mom switch off like we have her for three months and then he has her for three months i can't say much oh well that's great that's a good idea we ought to so that that works out good yeah and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever i don't know what they're gonna do it's really not my family it's my fiance's so i don't i can't say much but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either and i wonder i'm gonna be the only um-hum sibling that isn't gonna have children so if my parents do need to live with someone it'll probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for really you know and i'm i that's fine with me my fiancee i both figure that's what's we're gonna end up with both of the parents or whoever if it you know what i mean we feel like it's our responsibility and i feel like i would never put them in a home uh-huh but i wonder how much you know if one of us is gonna have to quit work someday or retire early or something you think about it and um-hum it's really i don't know this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country and you think i i i'm not really familiar with how other countries it's really more of a um like a respect issue and that the older the older people in other countries that i've been to seem to really have a lot more respect for the elderly people and and they really seen as wise and and in this country nobody really they're seen as senile yeah nobody really pays attention and they oh the old timer made with the old way and nobody respects the traditions and you know it's i i'm not saying that i do either but you know it's just funny and and we really don't have any they don't have social security and everything really isn't that much for right um-hum elderly people to live on you know even if they're in good health it's incredible they don't have any they don't get special treatment and maybe they should you know because we're all gonna get old someday right um-hum i know so it's a it's kind of depressing topic though how old are you um i'm twenty so it is yeah and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother yeah it's it really is but and she she drives us crazy  okay well basically i am a mother of a three year old so i can kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's uh uh-huh extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child uh trust their emotional and their safety and all the rest of that and uh i've been pretty selective and what i'm finding is with um right day cares that are like day care centers like for instance uh Learning Tree or KinderCare and all of that what i find is that they're highly structured highly organized um-hum almost too rigid for the children if you bring a child in at a certain time uh-huh uh like nap time or whatever time uh because of parents' hours they are differ and when i bring my daughter into a such a system like that uh they only have one thing going on that's nap time everybody's napping whether they came there an hour before or they came at right during that time and with that kind of a system my daughter um-hum just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down on a cot so um home day care has been an option and i've looked into that the only thing is you raise the question of um-hum is it safe uh can you trust the people you know um that's right and you never know i have um an ex-sister-in-law that um currently has a child abuse case on a home babysitter sure oh sure sure that's really scary and to the point that you kind of say to yourself especially home day care i mean i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out uh-huh right that you're better off if you're going to put a child into that type of system for eight hours it's fine it depends on the age of the child now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while but home teaching home day care works well if it's an infant if it's right if it's if you wanna have kind of like a family structuring where there's a home that they can be provided because i've seen things at the day care where they can't keep up with all the kids the kids have um-hum right colds and they're sick all the time and the  okay uh my name is Karen okay my name is Terry okay and this uh they said about magazines we i've probably personally take i think just two but that's because my mother-in-law takes every one they print and gives them to me a month later so okay so i get all of them uh the one that i really especially enjoy and you may be familiar with it from Wisconsin is called Country oh yes uh there's Country Living there's Country and uh well this yeah this one is the one that has all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live like Wisconsin oh yeah gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things and i get that it has recipes in it and that's my very favorite sure oh that's great what do you take well i actually take Country Living it's a country magazine and House Beautiful because i like um that kind of stuff decorating and uh getting ideas for a garden in fact uh right before you called i was planning my tulips uh-huh yeah decorating uh-huh are you and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm gonna put them so i'm really into that but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be oh and decorating and how to do things uh-huh decorating and gardening and recipes that kind of stuff so i'm pretty much in the same category as what you're looking at yeah well we we tried for a while to take a news magazine we took Newsweek and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and have it be digested but we've kind of discontinued that right now and we've we're gonna start taking that uh US News um-hum sure yeah yeah yeah we i've had Time before i think with that what happens is uh uh newspaper USA Today i think it is yeah it's interesting to read but you kind of just put the magazine away and you never read it again unless there's some big article in there that you're gonna keep for your kids but uh-huh that's right that's exactly right i did the same thing we saved the ones from the election and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake and then um-hum it exactly you you sound exactly like what we did we just saved everything we could for our daughter but uh and um-hum uh-huh that's pretty similar but i find that with these Country magazines i keep going back to them getting ideas looking back and saying jeez there was a flower garden in there that i seen that i would like to have some ideas you know so you get a lot of ideas from them well you sound like you that's the thing you sound like you have the facilities to do that yes we do we're out in the country we're right across from a river and uh you're right the leaves are beautiful and they are falling now so uh it just peaked uh last week and it was just gorgeous out here but oh oh i bet it is gorgeous yeah it's beautiful the other thing about magazines the only thing i don't like is they really get heavily into advertising and you know it's it's i agree it's fine i'd rather almost have i know that part probably half their money comes from these people that are saying um-hum uh put my ad in your paper and i'll pay you or whatever but uh there's been some magazines i've looked at and it's a real turn off to see every other page uh some kind of ad yeah right every page i did the same thing i i think i opened Vogue the other day or something and it was just nothing um-hum and i thought why buy this you know what's the point yeah Vogue is heavily into that you know yeah exactly it's almost i mean you could go into a store and get bombarded the same way but uh that's right and my number one pet peeve in a magazine is when they put the perfume in it uh-huh because uh real often i don't like very heavy perfumes and very often like you know in my bills also magazines and bills and they'll come out just stinking the whole thing yeah exactly exactly yeah they're really getting into that so but pretty much like it said the magazines i've had Better Homes and Garden and now i need a switch and i'm going back to Gourmet Cooking because um i've had the magazine uh-huh oh before back in nineteen uh eighty six and i thought well i'll give it a try again because you get tired of one magazine and you need to try and change i understand well do you do you tear out of your magazine your recipes or do you keep it uh yes i do and sometimes most of the time i tear them out a lot of times if uh you know if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter i'll go ahead and type out recipes but um-hum type it off uh-huh what i usually do is i'll try it out in the magazine first and uh without tearing it out and then give it a yeah and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection but uh see how the family liked it oh that's a good idea well i'm gonna pay attention more when i'm in the store to that Country Living i remember seeing the cover back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country uh primitive things yes the little the little pigs and the geese and the ducks and that we had that was the big rage here couple of years ago and i bought a lot of the country magazines and then it seems like when i put some of that away i quit buying it but i had forgotten the recipes um-hum sure sure uh-huh and i'm gonna i'll have to check that out yeah it it that's what i i just went through uh we just recently moved from Minnesota to Wisconsin i went through all this i had this huge stack of House Beautiful i had Colonial Times i had Gourmet uh-huh and you don't wanna part with any of them because there's one thing in each one yeah it was hard but i ended up uh reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of uh hundreds and i just said okay there's one picture in there that it really doesn't oh that's good you know it's got to have more than that it's got to have some good ideas it's got to have everything so i just kind of went through and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around Christmas time because it helps me uh-huh right right i i know  well this is a subject that you never think you'll be assigned to speak about one that kind of comes up when you've lost it no the other other subjects um as i was sitting there i thought the weather's been perfect i don't know much to say about it it's uh it's you know for the balloon festival here in Plano it was just gorgeous and are you it couldn't have been better i mean it didn't foul one launch and that's kind of unusual i'm from Plano also that's right and it's kind of cold in the mornings so you dress up warm but by and that's the only thing wrong i can find with it but right i just got back from Dayton i spent the weekend in Ohio with my family and the trees are changing color there so that as soon as we got out of the cloud cover of course it wasn't sunny like it is here it was real gray oh how fun i miss that yeah yeah but as soon as the plane got through the clouds and i saw all those trees it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall i don't complain weatherwise though because it was also thirty five degrees there yesterday morning and the high was only fifty and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon yeah ooh so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies i guess you have to take some things and leave some things that's right so yeah i'm from Utah area and the you know we have tons of canyons where the leaves change and they're gorgeous you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area yes we did that when we lived up in Michigan we went up to the upper peninsula and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure hm wow and then on leaf weekends it was which is this time of the year it's bumper to bumper traffic people it's whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves because they had to keep watching the road no it's kind of hazardous for driving that's for sure but i can't complain it i don't know if i've been spoiled i've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal we've only lived here a couple years but yes i think it is and my family said that in Ohio there was just an article on at the TV news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule huh as far as the coldness of the temperatures and uh the first frost everything just happened three weeks early this year we'll have to see how it goes a couple weeks ago we were cooler than normal but then we were back to being warmer than normal this week or last week so just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms in the spring i i don't have to live through many any of those really a bad i mean nothing comparable i guess to what you've had before well i've only been here just a short time too so i haven't been through any of those either so i have in Michigan but in in Michigan you can get twelve inches of snow and life goes on you're right so as i understand it here if there's anything they'll call off schools and and close businesses well they get ice and no one can drive on ice i mean we used to think they were pansies but then when you decided what ice was right right the real definition of ice so well i think we've discussed it good enough today so it was it was good talking to you maybe we'll get to next time thanks Karen bye bye i think so it was nice talking with you okay okay bye  okay let's talk about schooling yeah uh what what what contacts do you have with uh public school system okay well i have a boy and he just went into middle school early and i have a girl and she's in uh grade school and then i have a little boy who goes to uh they have something just before kindergarten and it's called Early Childhood and i have a young a young boy in that oh okay um-hum so i i have a lot of children in in the school system down here um-hum and um i think we have excellent teachers here i am really uh like the students like the way the teachers work with the students uh i've not been so um happy with the schools themselves i guess like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school and it was just packed um-hum i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents yeah and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if that's what the preferred to do or to uh work on the school work for another school to be built which is a good idea but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it yeah yeah so um i think one thing is that would maybe we don't have enough schools and secondly when we have enough schools sometimes we can't get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers well i think that's i think that's uh true i i've got a a little different uh contact but i've i've got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son that's a oh a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson ah but uh-huh oh great in general i i think that the you know one of the reasons that we we uh the choice to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and i think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are are not nearly to the extent that that we see through the out the country name and right right and i think and i think part of that is that is the the uh your big part of that is just uh the demographics the population in those schools are are typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh um-hum i think that's right although there is still some still some problems but uh i i you know i when when i was when i was going to school and i grew up in Iowa and and we in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh if ever if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home and and even more so and i think that that part of it is is not yeah exactly with the schools but with the with the uh the culture that doesn't doesn't value the education and doesn't value the schools and doesn't support uh the home yeah uh i think that's right what the schools are are trying to do it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just yeah that's true uh like and then if both of them have to work even that is a a hard situation um-hum for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them um-hum and i think it's really important that the parents work with the school um yeah i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts from what's happening in the school yeah yeah so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or she's just ready well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher she she has she has two half day classes so she has uh oh i bet she does um-hum you know on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh yeah right right but her her background is in is in uh child development and and uh so forth and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach and she's she's teaching rather than something else because that that uh-huh yeah that's the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that so right yeah uh and but uh the  okay uh how's it changed well uh it makes me realized how old i am that i can think of ten and twenty and even thirty years ago uh i can't go back that far well actually i can yeah thirty years ago was the Kennedy assassination yes i do certainly remember quite relevant for being in Dallas yes yes sir i've i've been there uh i guess changes in communications and computer technology seem certainly yeah the or any of these periods um i was just reading something recently about the uh Cuban missile crisis um-hum and uh and uh uh from what you know from then you know we had satellite pictures you know we can that's one  do you have a pet yes we have two too many at the moment um what all do you have well we have a um a dog as a golden lab and a um cat and they're both driving us crazy actually they're uh huh lot of work just a just a lot of work and the kids seem to be in so many activities that the reason for having the pets were you know for them and they don't seem to have the time to to care for them so we're at a frustration point with our pets how about you um-hum i know how that it is because until like a few days ago i had a little Miniature Pinscher oh and um my parents finally took him to Miami where they are what and um it was kind of a pain because i was taking these classes after work so i couldn't leave my dog locked up you know all day and then all night so i'm glad they took him right yeah because otherwise i would have a big mess in my apartment when i'd come home you know that's for sure they're they're a big responsibility they're really fun for especially for the kids if they have the time to enjoy them but so um-hum um-hum boy uh it's a lot of work it seems um-hum but i'm i'm single so it would keep me company that's true you know there's something you to come home to and happy to see you well i i enjoy mine if my husband's out of town i enjoy having the dog just for you know he'll he'll bark if anyone comes around or um-hum protection um-hum that sort of thing so it is a comfort from that standpoint um-hum do the cat and the dog get along or yeah they do they um um-hum they get along fine but the cat doesn't get along with anyone in the family she every time you walk by she grabs attacks your leg and just hangs on and we've had cats before we've never had one like this so i i don't know what the deal is with this cat huh did you find it or did you buy it or huh no it was a gift someone gave it to us for my daughter's birthday so um hm and we you know we had been looking for one so we were hoping to get one but this this one is kind of been a problem we live across the street from a vet and he just can't quite figure it out either so hm um-hum it is kind of strange i wonder where they got the the cat from it was um from uh um Wills Point i don't know if you're familiar with huh-uh the town you know just outside Dallas and knew somebody that lived in the country so we're wondering if maybe if they were kind of a country outside breed you know um huh um um-hum maybe they're just a little too wild or something um-hum because that's what i was wondering if you found it or not because it sounded pretty wild yeah well huh that's interesting but um does your husband hunt with the dog or anything or no no he's not a hunter he he's always liked having big dogs but um doesn't work real well in the city with small yard um-hum um-hum um-hum when we um when we get got the dog we lived out in the country and she could just run and that was fine that that worked real well yep oh how neat um-hum but now that we're in the city it's kind of hard yeah hm how long have you been living where you live um we've moved here in January hm so just not quite a year um you said you're going to school um-hum um-hum yep i i'm just at the Albany Easy Learning Center work uh-huh um i'm just taking education and psychology courses i'm a teacher and i have a bachelor's in psychology so i'm just trying to brush up on stuff to be a better teacher oh good yeah oh well that's good well i i bet your your kids do you have pets in your classroom or you don't um-hum hum-um nope downstairs they have a gerbil and a a what fish i think like a gerbil and a fish but in our particular classroom we don't have anything we have plants yeah yeah seems like our kids have mostly had um guinea pigs and that sort of thing in their classrooms and that's kind of neat you know um the whole class gets to take turns taking it home and um-hum um-hum hm and that so a little visiting pet you can you can uh have the fun of it without the total responsibility um-hum yep but that's worked well can just mess up it's cage you don't have to worry about your whole apartment right really yep um have you been trying to call in lately and it's been the same topic no um let's see i'm trying to think the last time i called in was probably um no few days ago it was cooking or something it was what cooking yeah really because i've been calling in lately and this is uh my last call that i have to make i think yeah and um every single day for probably about a week it was gun control oh gun control and i was just about to freak out you know because i already talked with someone about gun control get tired of gun control huh uh-huh you only can talk so much about gun control so hm this is true yeah well um-hum well do we go until they cut us off or  okay why don't you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon i'm already on my job so you're you reached me at my job oh you are oh wonderful well how do you dress for work my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual um-hum uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar uh-huh and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when i don't need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i don't um-hum so you in a church there yes uh-huh well i'm working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds and they have a lot of uh they they have Bible lessons and they have all the things during the morning but they still have snack time and play time so i'm gonna be dressing just in casual slacks and T-shirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes well around there you can probably wear uh T-shirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats yeah i'm envious well it's a beautiful day here and it's in the sixties but we still have a lot of hot afternoons it's supposed to be eighty five today so you'll still see people it's a it's kind of an in between change they're they're in their play clothes i mean they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just can't stand the sweaters but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly today today we we wear coats and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets do you i understand the wind will take away a lot of body heat well so are the people around you um uh dressing similar to you very similar um-hum so you don't have a you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do no i'm not stuck with that kind of a uh situation well that's good that's good as i say unless it happens to be now yesterday i had to dress up and and um be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at noon time um-hum but then i can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual well that's wonderful and then if i have a a a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening well my husband has to take the bus into Dallas and doesn't return all day so he has to dress and he's just really hates that they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit and even when his job is not gonna be with people all day long he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress yeah that's around here in a lot of places that's the way it is i mean there there are expected expected uh dress codes um-hum um-hum and the people need to follow that i think uh years ago i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but i've um-hum relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself well i think that's i think that's great i think that's good it's taken a long time to break away from from that but now that i've broken away from it i'm i'm glad i have i understand well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties and i will uh run around to the store and things in slacks and tennis shoes and she you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses anymore right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so uh she tells me i dress young but that's okay keeps me young that's a good idea that's a good idea well there's not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing no they're you know what so i i guess this is what you call a natural end yeah what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there well we wear uh course um like i said if if my husband's going downtown he's got the whole uh you know the dress men's dress shoes um-hum but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation yeah i'm sure they are there yeah i'm sure they are unless you wanna look like a gook that's right i'm sure that's true it's a lot different than working in a kid's preschool that's right well you all have a nice day there a lot different you too and thank you for calling um-hum bye thank you very much bye-bye  anyway yes so i'm so like what did you eat the last time you went to a dinner party well the last time i went to a dinner party was down at the lake and uh golly it was a dish uh from uh down in Panama uh-huh wow and uh i think the name of it was Paetha and uh it was a delicious meal what was it what was the dish well the dish was composed was composed of uh steak and chicken and shrimp all cut up you know um-hum uh into uh bite size portions and it had rice in it and tomatoes and vegetables and uh um-hum onions and green peppers and what you do is prepare this uh in a a large uh oh it looks like a large uh uh um-hum garbage can uh uh lid you know only turned upside down uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and uh this particular particular this particular person that cooked this uh cooked it over a burner propane burner course down in Panama they cook it right out right over right over an open flame um-hum um-hum and it's it's Paella is what it is because i've i've had that before yeah Paella how'd you know oh oh you have i'll be darned yeah i've friends who are Cuban who well they're Cuban and uh i was in Miami one time and they fixed that dish and they used squid in it it it had all kinds of meats and yeah well it right and they omitted the squid and there's one other item too that they omitted i can't i can't recall what that was but uh uh-huh um-hum uh we don't no we don't like squid it's too rubbery it's sort of like the a version it's sort of like a version of gumbo it's sort of like Latin American gumbo or something yeah but all this was cooked together they did serve French bread buttered uh bread and uh and uh it was delicious uh-huh we had that in fact uh Saturday night of this last week wow down at Caney City where's that oh it's about sixty miles this side of Tyler and uh and uh oh about a hundred uh let's see about seventy five miles from Dallas in between Tyler and us um-hum oh like near Canton or yeah is Canton is north uh uh north of us um-hum what's the name of that lake down there oh yes yeah it's on Cedar Creek oh okay well i know where that is yeah we have a lake house down there and jointly owned with another couple here in the neighborhood um-hum um-hum so we're always having parties and this particular time we had uh what we call our uh our our group here in uh in Richardson the uh what we're in we gather together and go out and eat at some restaurant or something of that nature um-hum or go to some event well i'm having friends over this weekend i'm from South Alabama originally south huh South Alabama way down there uh close to Mobile what town Mobile uh-huh yeah Foley uh and anyway so what what i one thing i like to do is i like to cook real Southern food and so my friends um you know whenever i cook they usually like for me to really like cook Southern food so this weekend we're i'm doing like fried chicken i'm going to fry chicken and have turnip greens um-hum and like a blackeyed pea salad and uh uh corn bread so i mean turnip greens with the greens too yeah actually just the with the greens not much of the turnips i don't like the turnip parts um-hum but so i mean it's kind of you know weird because you think all your yuppie friends wouldn't necessarily want to eat like that but they do do you like highly seasoned uh highly season it the turnip greens oh sometimes like with pepper sauce you mean yeah yeah i like to eat those green peppers just uh uh whole you know with turnip greens well i'm i yeah i i like seasoned food but i can it can get too much pretty quickly for me i i think but uh-huh well did you go to Auburn down there just off the subject yes well good did you know a Spivey down there i did a Spivey in Auburn yeah that went to Auburn no we had neighbors whose names were Spivey uh Aubrey Spivey uh what no they were neighbors of ours my parents live now live in Auburn my whole family my sister everyone lives in Auburn no Auburn i have a niece and nephew that graduated from uh from Auburn and he played football for Auburn broke his leg in the uh in the bowl down there at El Paso um-hum oh goodness Sun Bowl uh-huh in their uh in in oh that was a number of years ago he's probably oh probably pretty close to forty now um-hum well that's where i went to that's where i'm from i'll be darned but anyway so uh you really uh like to entertain your friends uh and  so the question the question had something to do with usage of personal computers um yes we are we are talking about computers this morning um i'm a firm believer in in having lots of them i'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me you have you have four machines around you boy well you've uh you've got me beat i have a a Zenith here um-hum and at home i have a Commodore um-hum and a Zenith and my wife has an AT&T 1200 i believe it is good grief what do you do with all those well actually on my Commodore i mainly study lottery numbers would you believe i have written some uh programs in basic um-hum whereby i can select any number of uh drawings and from that extract the numbers that have appeared the most um-hum right i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical uh appearance of these numbers um-hum to see if there's anything that's consistent on that i have another number that allows me another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered um-hum so this is what i do most of the time uh that's what you do on your at least one of your machines on your Commodore on my Commodore on my Commodore um-hum and of course i have uh word processors and i write all my letters is is wonderful uh my uh thoughts in my head come in bursts of about a paragraph at a time and i get them all down and yeah um-hum yes naturally on a computer if you make a mistake who cares you can go back and uh correct it very easily yes yes so that makes it very very nice i get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very very readily so how about you Charles well i um i do an awful lot of preparation of documents um uh and i i use word processors and and fancier programs i mean you know graphics programs and simply make all of our slides um some of them i do on a Sun some i do on an XT um-hum uh-huh um now maybe we don't call these personal computers um i started out with you know an IBM PC back in the you know about a year after they came out yeah and you know so where where may i ask where you work sir i i work for the government in Washington i know you work for the government i just wondering are you a NAVC or what what what section of it roughly of in in in an obscure part of the defense department oh uh-huh because see that's my type of work too i work at the Applied Research Lab here here on campus and um-hum my my field is underwater acoustics and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into uh studying uh-huh how uh things vary in the water you know and uh taking advantage of them and so forth so it's a very nice very nice field and i i am retiring at the end of this month end of December excuse me um-hum are are are you are you also a professor or or do you just research yes i'm a professor i'm an associate professor but my i my i'm a full time researcher um-hum yes and it's uh been a very very interesting career believe me i can believe what are you gonna what are you gonna do when you stop i mean take all your machines with you or well well uh the ones here in the laboratory obviously i'm they're gonna stay but i have similar machines at home i would consider uh uh doing some more consulting when i get home um-hum um-hum but i have a very very busy extra life anyway i'm also a musician and i play in several symphony orchestras and uh i run a concert band and yes um-hum so i have a lot of external uh interests yes but i do want to get very deeply much more deeply into computer work because obviously the world is gonna be controlled run and operated by computers in the future there's no doubt about it because it is really taking over yes um-hum and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers because uh it's so much involved um-hum and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than i am because uh i don't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to here again let's say i'm starting to getting ready in preparation for retirement and uh so basically what i'm doing is yeah yeah slowly getting rid of my things for many many years i had a full size acoustics uh study laboratory where where i could take recordings and and uh perform experiments with them and so forth and so that's gone now and so i'm sort of out of business um-hum um-hum um uh as i say i worked with NAVC fellow named Steve Blazey was the fellow i worked with for many many years and he is now retired um-hum um-hum so it's been an interesting life and computers have come in towards the latter end of that i wish we'd had computers in the very beginning it would have been  well i know you like to eat we're we can even discuss restaurants oh i tell you i thought uh this is a great topic for me because i love to eat out my husband says i'd eat out every meal if i could um-hum um i like well my favorite restaurant in the whole uh Dallas area is uh Siciliano's A Taste of Italy i love Italian food and they have wonderful garlic rolls and um-hum uh-huh yeah hm all of their entrees are wonderful have you ever heard of that place where is it there's one on Arapaho right at the intersection of Arapaho and Jupiter and then there's one i live in Garland and it uh-huh uh-huh yeah i was gonna say that yeah there's another one over here real close to my house at Walnut and Shiloh but they've built some more there's one over in the Hurst area of Fort Worth and i know i've seen it somewhere yeah what is it is it what's it like just good food yeah it is the atmosphere is okay i mean it's kind of dark and has candle lit tables and that kind of thing but it's not a real fancy place you know it's just the food is just really exceptional and they give you real big quantities um-hum and it and all their entrees come with like a salad and soup and all the rolls you can eat and so by the time you get your food you're already full value and taste yes i uh i am not a as much an Italian food fan except for garlic bread and i could eat my weight in garlic bread oh oh well you could go there what i do sometimes for lunch is uh just just get like soup and salad and eat their garlic bread because it's so delicious yeah uh-huh um-hum i would love that i mean but uh you know that's what except for the type of food that's kind of what i like yeah well um what's your favorite place um my i Mexican restaurant oh you like Mexican i like that too and um and and i work uh downtown and so there are a lot around here um and and in oh yeah oh you know like the Knox central you know On the Border i like for one kind of food and then there's the holes in the wall i like for another another type um uh-huh yeah and uh uh but what i look for is cost and yeah well i don't i don't know i don't like noisy restaurants either i that's why i don't go to On the Border that much well that's neat yeah well that's my main thing too yeah yeah yeah yeah that is a real noisy place yep and i've only been there a couple of times but the the times i was there i felt like my head was echoing when i was trying to talk and i mean it's just i don't know it's a cavern you know it's just because it's so big and tall and and a big room of full of lots of people or or what yeah yeah yeah i know what you're talking about well we have a a restaurant down here a lot of people won't even eat there but uh we like it it's Pancho's have you ever been there Mexican buffet uh-huh yes the all you can eat buffet my husband goes there for lunch and he just i mean he thinks it's uh Mexican food Mexican food you know it's oh uh-huh yeah oh yeah well they have a chili relleno or chili relleno um-hum really i've heard they're good they're really good and they uh the plates the thing i like about this place is they bring you all the chips and stuff you can eat plus they bring sopapillas as many as you want um-hum oh yeah so you know a lot of places you have to order that separately yeah oh it's really nice and the children eat free we have two kids and extras and oh one of them eats free the other one's up above that age but she still gets a you know reduced price yeah so it's a real good deal for a family to go and you can just really get full so it's good yeah that's uh that's what i like cheap and then but i like but do you like to go out or do you eat at McDonald's a lot or stuff like that yeah well i like i really prefer to go you know some place where i sit down and someone waits on me but um my kids of course both love McDonald's and uh McDonald's Burger King anything that's got a place to play or yeah right so i spend time at those places too because i know how much they enjoy we go to Show Biz a lot but do you have children yeah no i don't but um um Show Biz is the noisiest place you can imagine because so you've kind of got to go there for playing for the kids and not for you right that's right it they have a wonderful area to play you know they have big balls and games and rides and i mean all kinds of stuff it's like a little bitty amusement park in there yeah oh and it's really fun they have these uh puppets that get up and sing and dance and you know so it's real entertaining for the kids and the food is good they have real good pizza there um-hum yeah good pizza i love pizza but i usually order that pizza is what i usually order you know at the house deliver it to me uh-huh right have it at home yeah and anything but Domino's yeah i know i don't like Domino's either i don't like their politics yeah yeah well i've just never cared for for their pizza at all we have a Little Caesar's down here oh that's wonderful i've had their food before yeah yeah it's really good and very um you get a good quality for the money you pay do you we get lots of coupons on our doors and and that's and i end up ordering from those like Spinners or Winnsers or you know the so yeah yeah yeah uh-huh i don't know that we have any big one down where i live i live in East Dallas so it's uh oh you do is it northeast northeast or over by White Rock Lake oh okay yeah that's really not that far from Garland just and  well i almost forgot the topic i was waiting so long for uh for it to find somebody uh it was it's on your favorite TV shows and why right well so what is your favorite TV show uh Major Dad oh you like that one i i love it i think it promotes good family values and it's funny um-hum i've i've never really watched that one you know it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows that's right yeah uh and uh you know there's so there's only a few that i that i like to watch routinely what kind do you like to watch probably my favorite is um oh well i i like shows like Growing Pains and uh what's the other one now they moved from Tuesday night to Wednesday night so i don't get to watch it very much Wonder Years Wonder Years yeah that's my favorite uh i like both of those real much also i i think basically they promote same thing they promote family values yeah yeah Wonder Years i i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever i guess i can really really relate to it and uh it's just a real cute show uh i i guess i like the shows that really have a a real sense of uh i don't know honesty or sort of a purity value i guess i do too i i don't like it uh lot of the shows that that i've liked in the past like uh oh Golden Girls and some of them tend to get so risque and when you have children uh-huh yeah uh watching it that sometimes really starts to bother me and uh right right that's one of the reasons i mean if you want to go all time favorite show probably one of them was Little House on the Prairie uh-huh yeah my wife really likes that show yeah which i just i always i always felt was wonderful uh and so many of them nowadays like i said i think are just um uh-huh uh they they go after yeah well like i said the risque stuff just i guess they think that's what people want to watch yeah well there was but there's a sense of honesty i guess purity in the show like one of my favorite shows used to be Happy Days but uh yes you know Richie always used to be so you know just so honest and pure i guess and when he left the show you know that it seemed to be missing that part of it and i never did like it after that yeah um-hum um-hum so i i don't know i i say see the same thing in like Wonder Years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere yeah i i agree uh do you like the sports programming yeah uh-huh um i i enjoy those also almost as as much to a certain extent i'm our whole house is baseball fans and uh we enjoy that and uh uh-huh so you're gonna watch a game tonight oh yeah oh yeah they're so do you do you have a favorite for the series or anything uh probably the Pirates but only because of Steve Bushel i guess otherwise i really don't care that much but uh you know i'm i'm oh uh-huh yeah annoyed that the Rangers got rid of him and uh i'd like to see him do well laugh all the way to the bank i guess yeah yeah he's a nice guy i i take it you live in the Dallas area do you live in the Dallas area with as much pardon uh live in live in Plano uh-huh yeah i live in Garland and yeah i i like Steve Bushel but i don't really like the Pirates i'm a big Saint Louis Cardinals fan so uh i'm kind of i'm kind of pulling for the Braves over all they you know they um-hum um-hum they've come from so far down i really would like to see them do well well yeah yeah it's uh it's what i keep hoping the Rangers are going to do yeah one one year then maybe they'll make it i don't know right so but uh yeah i'd like sports programming quite a bit but uh i guess my my favorite shows are the and you know the getting back to a point that you made that's really true we are watching Roseanne i guess couple of weeks ago and her daughter was talking about birth control you know and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time and you know she's only seven years old so um-hum well it's so many of them now um you know it it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in and and uh yeah you know i'm you know i'm i'm an adult and i have adult tastes now but i don't need that yeah yeah yeah uh i i like things that uh uh are wholesome i guess yeah well that that seems to be more our values too like like the Wonder Years i i mean uh it's kind of risque stuff for maybe for teenagers you know or and and you can kind of relate to it you know i don't know that's i enjoy that a lot um-hum yes yes but uh you know i i i agree with you the and it's funny because the shows like a lot of them that used to be considered risque like Three's Company and stuff i think they they maintained people would watch them because there was that uh you know there was really the period that was going on there i mean he really wasn't messing around with the girls but everybody perceived him that way and stuff um-hum but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died yeah and it's it's interesting that that a lot of the shows are that way  hobbies do you have um i i do i play tennis and softball and i do a little bit of woodworking around the house furniture stripping and stuff like that ah do you do antiques uh well i have this uh huge kitchen cabinet that uh it was like an old cabinet my buildings from was built in nineteen oh four oh so i have this cabinet that had about eight layers of paint on it and i stripped it down and i'm still working on it for about it's been about a year that i've been working on it oh my it's beautiful moldings and a beautiful cabinet and as soon as i'm done with it it should be good ah we use like a heat gun to strip it and then uh chemicals to get the rest of the paint out of the crevices and stuff like that do you do all this in your house yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically oh uh-huh oh i was able to take some of the pieces apart like some of the shelves out to clean them out independently and stuff boy that's an ambitious project yeah a little too ambitious had you ever done any refinishing before no i'd done nothing like it before but a neighbor of ours had done this and it looked uh looked nice so we figured we'd try it ourselves oh so the neighbor was able to give you guidance um a little bit she didn't tell us she did say it was gonna be hard work she was right she was right yeah and she was right yes so uh what kind of work do you do you do any you do anything like that or what are your hobbies well uh i do a lot of needlework and i also do puzzles for magazines i get paid for this i've written two puzzle books really uh-huh and so in my free time even though it's not a hobby and that i do get paid for it i'm always developing new puzzles and activities and and word games mind benders that type of thing crossword you do crossword puzzles mostly or or no they're they're variety type puzzles uh not crosswords just all different kinds find the hidden word and um you know anagram type puzzles acrostic cryptograms right uh mostly for children but some of them go up through grade twelve so and i've developed a lot of my own type of puzzles like word snakes and grid graphs and things like that so that's what published so if i have free time i'm usually sitting down with uh graph paper doing some puzzles is that what you do for a living or you do other things i'm a writer for a living i writer other things i'm a freelance writer huh grand fantastic and uh i was a teacher for fourteen years and i'm not teaching because we've had to move around so much that i are you from Texas no oh i i live in Texas now but i'm from Southern Ohio originally oh okay and uh we've lived in Michigan and it seems like wherever i go i need to take forty hours of college in order to update my teaching credentials right so i decided i didn't want that to be my hobby any more after paying thousands and then moving the next year so um now i'm i'm just writing at home well you have yeah you have a good career for that crossword puzzles and writing you don't have to go out my wife's my wife's an editor and we just had our first child so she's yes oh and what does she edit uh magazines she'd worked for a dance magazine and American oh you probably

people going up there and uh she worked on the show daily doing the um you know the the daily uh magazine that they print out oh well that so that's good and they've now that she's possibly probably not going to go back to work at least for a few years um she's gotten freelance work from people oh great so she gets to uh do her hot stuff i don't know if they care what topics we talk about anyway right just no i don't think so so does she take in manuscripts like fiction to edit um yeah she would anything like that because i'm in a a large writers group here in Dallas called Dallas Area Romance Authors do you live in the Dallas area no uh we're from New York oh you're from New York oh well there's a large group there too it's a national thing Romance Writers of America and they're always looking for freelance editors yes right oh let me let me give you let me give you uh our address okay i can send her some information about it because i know they mail manuscripts and for a

write this down and send it she loves to read that's really the type of work that she would like to do even though she never did that professionally oh good yeah uh yeah she's started in other fashions but not not not specifically reading novels and editing them and and proofreading them and stuff so i think she would like that okay let me take down the information and i'll send her who to who to send her credentials to right great her name's Mary C Murphy okay and her address is two twenty five two twenty five West End Avenue  okay so you're into microwave cooking yeah it's just it's so easy nowadays you know and it's uh especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave and it be ready in just a few minutes and that yes and that's what we all are looking for isn't it something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work yeah i've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that i have leftovers all week all week well we've done that too there's just my husband and i and he he sometimes makes a huge spot of uh pot of spaghetti and we um-hum you know we're eating it for a week and a half and i kind of get sick of it after a few days i know i try not to make too much it's just my husband and i too and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week but uh i usually i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or you know something like that or sometimes a roast but uh-huh yeah right right what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party um i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas oh it's it's really good i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with and uh every time i've served it everybody just loves it uh-huh ooh that sounds delicious so that's that's one of my favorite things to make what about you um-hum we i end up with an old standby that we call Russian chicken because it's so easy um-hum and uh it goes you have to cook very little to go with it just some rice and some salad and that's about it you know uh-huh well what do you put in it uh you make you just take your boneless chicken breasts and then you take and make a a dressing out of uh Russian dressing one bottle of that uh-huh and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix um-hum and three ounces of apricot preserves ooh that sounds good and you mix it up and you just put it on the top of the chicken and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour uh-huh and then i take the foil off and let it brown uh-huh takes about another twenty minutes uh-huh and it's delicious ooh that sounds good and it's so simple because i can pop it in when i come in the door you know and then uh go about my business and by the time i've got everything else ready the chicken's ready chicken's done is done right so that's a real easy thing for me yeah that sounds good too um-hum i've got a um a great recipe for cheesecake oh really i don't know if you get Southern Living that magazine no i don't my mom gets that but they have one if you like to cook they have every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one really and um you know every month they've got all different kinds of recipes but i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheesecake and it's just a regular cheesecake and then you can put raspberry um topping on it but inside the cheesecake uh recipe you put um um-hum lemon peel and orange peel hm and it's just enough to taste it you know when when when you're eating the cheesecake and it is wonderful but it takes a long time because you have to cook it for forty five minutes and then you turn the oven off and you leave it in the oven for another forty five minutes and then you open up the oven door and leave it in for another forty five minutes hm oh my goodness and then you're supposed to um i think chill it to room temperature um-hum so sometimes i'll do that overnight and then put the topping on the next day but it's it's very good well i love cheesecake i have never been i don't know the ones i have made i have not done that well with um-hum uh-huh i like a baked cheesecake you know i don't i've had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff and refrigerate it you know but that's not the same as a a New York style cheesecake right yeah no no and uh the recipes that i've used everybody will say oh this is real simple and then i make it and it's it's really not very good it's not right but yours sounds good i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness it does and it it it is really good hm well that sounds interesting so there's your good dessert for your dinner party it is it is pretty good right are you into serving wines with your dinner party oh sometimes but i mean i'm not a wine connoisseur by any means me either i wish i knew more about it i've been to you know some wine tastings up in Napa Valley but um um-hum you know and i learned a little bit about them then but you know what would be fun they have some of those classes you can take um-hum they would be if you just had time to do it and yeah and then there's places um do you live in Dallas okay there's places here that um um-hum offer i think it's like once a month you can go and to a particular restaurant or whatever and you can kind of take a cooking class um-hum and then you get to eat everything afterwards and then they also go into the wines you know to serve with you know different types of of meals and that kind of thing and it sounds like it's a lot of fun we have some friends who've done that and they've really enjoyed it well how neat um-hum hm well i didn't even know they were offering that i guess i yeah this place is called like Medina's or Mesina's Kitchen or something like that um-hum oh well i bet that'd be a fun thing to do yeah it it sounds like like it  okay the topic of the conversation is national health insurance and the pros and cons and do i do we think that the government should finance it what is your opinion i say yes you say yes yes mother lives in Florida and there are in her subdivision there are fifty percent Canadians who won't give up their Canadian citizenship because of the health insurance i have heard someone else uh say that uh the Canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent it's wonderful and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes oh well this is evidently evidently this is one of the ways that they're paying for the program plus discouraging the people to quit smoking so they don't have to pay out as many uh benefits on like lung cancer and things like this well even if that's so you know really when you look at it they have full coverage they have HMO which you know after you get used to it it's not too bad and uh everything is covered yeah if and we have so many people in the United States that we spend well in my family alone we spent four thousand dollars in July on medical bills oh my word Lynn insurance didn't cover a penny yeah that's horrible yes it is horrible well we're fortunate in that we so far knock on wood most of us have been relatively real healthy so we don't have a lot of medical bills yeah but if uh if you're healthy it's fine but i had two kids in the hospital in July yeah but what worries me is the fact that i don't like the government telling me who i can see and who i can't see yeah but you know Richardson School District has the HMO and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list um-hum are they yeah well i know that Greg uh James had it McCullum is i beg your pardon McCullum is yeah yeah i know that when James was with Continental Steel McCullum was part of that and and that's good but i also heard for instance like uh a friend's daughter was on it through Texas Instruments and she was on that Kaiser Permanent uh-huh and they had screwed up her appointment and when she went in she had to take whichever doctor was available and they she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted well but that's but then again i guess you can even do that in McCullum's that's a screw up in an appointment you know i'm thinking going back to the days when i was pregnant um-hum and i had two doctors and one was my favorite personality wise uh-huh but when i delivered Ronnie he was not on call the other guy delivered him um-hum well that's true and that still goes on you know and that and you know if um i go to Townsend he's got a new partner um-hum i go to both of them now you know i have no choice right you know because when i want to go if Doctor Howe or whatever his name is is on duty i go to him well you know it uh how do you think we're going to pay for it more and more taxes well no we need to cut some of our spendings cut some of the fat off the top and whittle it down to the rest of us i know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses no they don't pay anything on uh implants or transplants no and you know people are needing these and the average person can't afford you know a heart or a kidney on just their own yeah but you known Ronnie in Austin went to a program and went to a social worker uh-huh and at the same token there is something because he can get his pills for two dollars when i'm paying fifteen on my medical insurance good grief and he can get free medical care but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing David um-hum and so again you know we went through it Ronnie's home tonight and we talked about it and said you know is it worth it yeah you know he pays forty five dollars a month for his prescriptions where he could pay six dollars hum um-hum um-hum so there are programs you know if you get on Medicare or Medicaid or one of those that's very true well i know they have the Medicaid you know for those that have trouble and i know that like we have the uh prescription cards which that's helped bunches yeah and wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health or wonder if they're wanting it that's what i read that they are wanting  okay well um what kind of music do you like i am i was thinking about it for a long time and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music um i don't have a whole lot of dislikes i um like jazz um especially the blues and uh i like uh a lot of the uh of course the classics um everything back from Bach and and Beethoven and Chopin and um just in general everything um-hum um i enjoy uh a lot of the the modern forms um uh still do you like like rock and those kind of things punk even yeah right right uh well that gets some of the punk um when i was in high school that was uh one of the big things was punk music and uh a lot of it is has a lot to say or some some of it has a lot to say the music does the lyrics do but the the actual i don't think they have a whole lot to say even uh well it it's it's it really expresses some of the opinions of of the people who enjoy the music yeah i guess um but as far as a musical art form i just don't see a whole lot of art to it um uh-huh do you like rap um some of it um it depends i like uh the rap the two types of rap i like or i enjoy to listen to and one is the the rap that is just funny um and they usually do a lot of satire yeah um that kind i kind of like some of it is kind of right right the monotonous the monotonous no that's not pointless yeah i don't enjoy that at all when they're just talking about well i'm better than you and blah blah blah i don't like that i like the funny satire and then some of it is uh-huh yeah yeah some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our in yeah urban society it it really does it talks about um race relations and police relations and um that that i guess i don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny more satire kind some times um i'm with you though i like classical um um-hum um-hum i don't like to listen to it all the time but um some of the time anyway i like easy listening just kind of you know i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more i used to like it all right but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason um let's see country western uh i'm not quite as big on that some of it's okay um yeah that's that's about my opinion of that yeah it's it's okay um uh some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess so hm the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination yeah behind it the one country and western song sounds like every other country and western a lot of them sound uh really similar yeah and so the the musicians don't get to really get into their music they just play a certain number of chords the drummer plays a certain beat and you have a country and western song yeah hm and well that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes too i guess they don't really has kind of the same sound over and over and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are hm you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs right which probably is just as well on some of them too yeah and i can't say that i like a lot of the modern the very very modern yeah uh rock and roll but i i definitely i really enjoy the fifties the sixties and a lot some of the seventies yeah earlier things rock and roll and uh i really enjoy especially the sixties uh every  okay well what movie have you seen i think the last one that we actually went to go see well there's two i took my kids to see 101 Dalmatians of course they wanted to see it they had the Disney book and they thought that was wonderful and they loved the dogs and uh-huh uh-huh it's one of my favorite even so yes we went with some friends of ours and i was a little worried about my son he's about two and a half and uh-huh he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and can't see them yeah yeah yeah and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message you know that the the the puppies are missing and it shows the town and you can hear all the barking but you can't see the dogs yeah oh yeah a whole lot uh-huh kind of dark uh-huh yeah so that kind of bothered him but after that he did fine is it well how is he young yeah he'll be three in January yeah okay that makes sense yeah well my kids' very favorite and yours may be too young for it was Home Alone i loved that movie they uh well we do too but they just wanna rent that one that is their very favorite probably gives them ideas of what they wanna do right they think that is so cute i guess so so i guess so i guess so we're not real big movie goers ourselves but we did try to go see about a month ago that um Dead Again yeah that black and white one and i was not real impressed with it in fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what what did that mean wait wait run that back and we couldn't run it back wasn't that good um-hum but we we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end and we thought we were being very quiet this man turned around and said could you all please save that for later and i'm sorry so we're just not real big movie goers oh no well i like to watch the movies but it's gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video and we rent them yeah well that's us too that's us too and now we did go see Home Alone at the dollar movie and that was just hilarious i died yeah i thought that was cute too and we we did also we went to see What About Bob one night which is a funny funny movie with uh well my husband's name is Bob and he wants to see that it's a funny movie yeah he wanted to see that i thought the funny part in Home Alone was uh that's good for kids is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking that's true and i thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that the little guy's so cute and he's terribly rich by now i hope he stays cute not spoiled you know you get to where yeah me too oh that's right the money goes to their heads or goes to something you know they grow up too fast so that's right but uh there's a lot i wanna see you know what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out on video you know i'd like to see Green Card i want to see Awakenings uh i'd like to see Silence of the Lambs that's right uh-huh Awakening is supposed to be wonderful yeah Awakening is supposed to be wonderful my mom saw that and she said that was an excellent movie yeah and see i've had somebody tell me that Regarding Henry you know the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good i'd like to see that yes yes i think that's supposed to be good and i uh we have some doctors at church who said that Doctor was just wonderful um-hum i've heard that's good yeah so i think there's a bunch of good movies coming out my kids wanna see Rescuers Down Under uh-huh so i'm going to have my VCR went on the blitz about two weeks ago so i'm getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies their little you know Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff and oh dear uh-huh well on uh back to your movie you saw that ten thousand uh 101 Dalmatians um uh did you all ever think about purchasing that one when it comes out yeah do you know i look at those like Cinderella came out was for sale and i don't buy them i now i will copy them and rent them and keep them at home but i just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that i can go down and rent for a dollar um-hum uh-huh uh-huh well i understand that too i understand that too now they had you know and they don't last that long um-hum they had Home Alone offered for like i think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars and i thought well now that's that's close enough to being several you know you could rent it more than once more than four times and watch that oh that's pretty decent yeah yeah that that makes it worth it uh but a lot of the Disney movies it's just too expensive and i can rent them or i can make a copy you know my daughter's in love with the Little Mermaid and i have a copy that's just about worn out she's four well i understand i understand i understand oh yeah of course uh-huh yeah so she just thinks the great in fact she told me Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial now i'm not pregnant mind you but this is she's planning ahead for me yeah so oh sweet but that's in her plans well it's hard it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids yes and even the ones that we rent at home the trouble with some of them i know we rented Adventures in Babysitting thinking that would be so cute and it's a precious movie but the language in it is just for no reason oh i saw has to stick in now see i remember thinking it's a wonderful movie but it's been so long since i watched it i don't remember the language it was bad well that's true uh-huh well you watch it differently when your kids are in the room you know and i was just sitting there going oh my goodness and i'm going to have to stop and explain and they go i know Mommy i know oh and see my kids weren't in the room you're right i watched it without them uh-huh yeah it's it's real different because you see things from a different different angle huh huh uh we rented this summer before we went on vacation we rented Chevy Chase and that Family Vacation yes and those are just absolutely hilarious but you just really can't watch a lot of that we had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it yes yes some of it just isn't a  okay while i was waiting for you to connect i i thought of a couple of menus i decided it'd to be if it's informal or not you know if it was informal i'd probably choose something i mean just like hamburgers or steaks out on the grill um-hum um-hum because that's a lot of fun especially this time of year where it's so nice out yes um it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something i'm not i'm not into formal dinner parties but i see i'd probably go with lasagna a green salad and garlic bread so what what do you use for cookbooks um i have a Pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married but it's kind of the bible of cooking for me then i have some from like church um-hum um-hum that are more family recipes that are more useful you know budget cookbooks but um-hum um-hum and of course you get a lot from when you're growing up um-hum um i cook a lot the same as as my mom did of course i've added several different recipes but what would you serve or what would you right well i i i think we come from from different backgrounds um so the the well that's good i i i start with different you know have different perspectives that you are i find the Joy of Cooking to be a remarkably useful book to to fall back on because it has almost everything in it um-hum but on the other hand it's not very inspiring uh it's a good reference when you need to dig something up uh-huh what we've find very useful is a a book called The Thirty Minute Cookbook i think that's the title uh by Marion Burrows huh uh which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes you know the whole meal yeah that would be wonderful in these times and so she's yeah now now i i find that the cutting up of the food and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes yeah either they're really fast or but but they're but they're but they're interesting they're interesting menus um uh-huh combinations that you wouldn't have normally thought of uh-huh um what's one of your favorites um gee the one i had most recently was was one that was had she she describes as Jim Beard's favorite um summer menu or something and it consisted of uh grilled kielbasa sausage um a uh-huh potato salad with olive oil and uh some tomatoes that had been chopped up with onions and curry powder and probably some yogurt was in there wow sounds pretty good um and that and that was you know that's that that's certain you can do in thirty minutes yeah but there are a whole lot of you know i mean i i would recommend you look at that book if you're if you are a busy person Thirty Minute Cookbook yeah those Thirty Minute Cookbook that sounds fun i find a lot of the cookbooks that i don't know that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients or things i don't keep on hand all the time um-hum and i have young children and our budget's set you know at this time but i want to use simple recipes that i have things on hand i don't have to run to the store to buy um-hum or look for something i haven't heard of so that's why sometimes i shy away from uh more of a traditional cookbooks but yes yes um-hum but well it was interesting talking to you it's a fun subject food is one of my favorite things too yes anything else you wanted to add well you had said dinner you know you know what would i put together for a formal dinner we had we had some friends over as recently as Saturday night and and um oh wow um-hum put here here the inspiration was a combination of Julia Child for the dessert well you know a chocolate mousse recipe um-hum that's good and a sort of palate cookbook which has a recipe for a thing called chicken Marabella uh-huh um which is this wonderful thing you can do um basically you're baking baking chicken in a in an open pan um having marinated it first hand my my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details but it's marinated in olive oil and some seasoning uh-huh uh-huh um and cooked with some olives and some and some prunes uh there's a little bit of brown sugar in there and it bakes up it's a delicious thing and it's easy that sounds good comparatively so i that sounds really good um i'm sorry i just love food it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am i'm pretty simple right now but well maybe we had a little more leisure time to do it i don't know yeah that's probably that's true i have little ones and we and they won't eat you know too many different foods right now so yeah i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little yeah in terms of their tastes yeah on the other hand sometimes it was easy they'd you know canned ravioli was was one of their favorites and so it was easy to yeah spaghetti's a pretty staple every other week or so so and it goes a long ways too so open a can of ravioli or yes well nice talking to you Cheryl all righty we'll talk to you later maybe okay bye  okay basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for uh uh real hard hard rock i really can't get into that but uh-huh i go from classical all the way to uh jazz and country and uh-huh uh soft pop um so i pretty much have a a wide range of um what i like you know just uh-huh there isn't any particular music that i enjoy more than just listening to all kinds so yeah so that's about it i can even take the reggae now it's it's pretty neat music that they came out with so i'm pretty much the same way but there's like certain types of country western i can't handle that twangy stuff uh-huh sure uh-huh sure the the old old stuff that came out i think it was was it oh jeez came out with some of that Hank Williams you talk about twangy yeah yeah yeah my in-laws listen to the kind of music i hate yeah oh yeah the old old country the old real old yeah but other than that i like pretty much everything and uh yeah yeah yeah that's the way i am too so other than uh as far as instruments so i can go from piano to the saxophone and lately you know with the new music that has come out some of the really good uh music uh-huh they have the saxophone playing and it's so funny because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself oops are you okay Tina come here honey oh my daughter just fell come here um-hum um-hum um-hum do you like Kenny G uh yeah a little bit i can i can pretty much oh it's all wet Tina i just wiped uh did the floor and she slipped so uh-huh oh no anyway but uh um yeah i can take all kinds of music pretty much except for when you get like i said into the real hard rock uh-huh uh yeah the heavy metal yeah and that i don't i don't have interest of losing my ears let's just put it that way hearing anyway yeah i saw Peter Townsend on TV last night and he said he's lost most of his hearing and i thought no wonder uh-huh sure uh-huh exactly so hm okay well it was good talking to you then well same here y'all have a good day bye-bye oh okay you too bye now  do you or your husband work for TI or i'm a contract person at TI in fact involved with uh data switchboard oh are you oh i see well that's neat uh-huh and uh do you work for TI uh-huh so i've worked for them for several years like twelve now i guess oh you sound very young like just out of college well i try to i try to think of myself as young but uh well have you seen any movies recently uh i'm trying to think we saw uh Dances With Wolves and uh have you seen that one oh did you no i haven't i have i have a hard time with movies that are real long i don't know that was excellent well surprisingly enough i do too i get tired of sitting there and so does my husband but we both just thoroughly you know enjoyed it just really liked it yeah yeah well i've heard a lot of good things about it and uh i'm trying to think we went to see a uh a real funny one i can't think now what the name of it was i've gone blank was it uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the Naked Gun Two and a Half oh we have not seen that we want to see that one yeah that was that was pretty funny and then we saw what was the spoof on Top Gun it's oh i haven't seen that one oh i can't think of what it was called we saw that too that i was pretty disappointed in that one yeah but uh so you know through the summer we have small children so we don't get to see too many but we've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer were you my husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them he likes to rent them and so we watch a lot of them you know at home as they come out and uh yes yes uh-huh right have you seen Ghost yet i really i enjoyed that movie did you now i i was real disappointed i'm a real big Patrick Swayze fan and uh i was really disappointed in it it was one i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating anticipating and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny really uh-huh oh yeah now yeah and uh and it wasn't you know at all it was it was more of a love story and uh so i was really disappointed in that because i like him real well we just got through watching one with uh yeah um-hum uh is it Claude Van Damme oh Van Damme yeah i think yeah and uh enjoyed it i can't think of what the name of it was but it was a uh of course one of the typical you know kicking fighting lots of blood and guts and all that type move and and we enjoyed that and uh right right uh-huh the uh uh the one with Jodie Foster did you see it yes wasn't that excellent oh Silence of the Lambs yes i did yeah i really enjoyed that a lot yeah that was one that that stayed with me you know for a month i just i kept thinking about it you know uh-huh yeah well it's amazing but really i mean when you stop and think about it uh Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie and yet it was his character that was so intriguing no oh it was excellent and and of course he's such a uh very good actor anyway and i think he made the movie yeah yeah i do too i really do you know Jodie Foster was good too but i think i think Anthony Perkins was the one that that really made the movie i agree with you you know is it Anthony Perkins or Anthony Hopkins Hopkins uh-huh i know i know it uh well i'm not a real big Jodie Foster fan but i thought she was good in that oh Hopkins i'm sorry Hopkins yeah i always get those guys mixed up well i i agree well i haven't been i'm i saw her in The Accused and i thought that was a pretty good movie i thought she no now i didn't see that one that was that was a pretty uh interesting movie and uh but you know i i did i really liked the Silence of the Lambs that was really intriguing and it it didn't scare me all that much you know and i i don't like to go to movies to be scared that's not why i go no no i like a good suspenseful story and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats in fact i want to uh rent it when it comes out for my husband to see because he didn't he won't go see that no i went with uh our daughter so right and that one was oh he didn't see it oh uh-huh and uh so you know saw it with her and uh enjoyed it my all time favorite is Weekend At Bernie's did you see it um oh really yeah i've seen it oh i've seen it you know we saw it at the movies and then we've rented it several times and we just love it in fact we have a ten year old grandson that he and my husband and i we just sit there and cackle you know and just get hysterical uh-huh uh-huh yeah i've seen that it's pretty it's pretty cute i guess you know as far as comedies go probably my favorite is Young Frankenstein i don't know i love that movie uh yes yes my husband liked that yeah so uh he's a big Gene Wilder fan yeah well Gene Wilder doesn't do that much for me but i'm a big uh Mel Brooks fan all his movies i really really enjoy uh-huh uh-huh he has a new one out and uh-huh uh i have seen it advertised i don't know what the name of it is he does oh is that the one with that's he's starring in oh yeah that came out like early in the summer or something i think yeah i haven't seen that one either it um-hum um-hum yes yes and my husband wants to see that one and uh did you see that one that he made years and years ago about the uh the sheriff oh Blazing Saddles yeah uh-huh Blazing Saddles oh that's my husband's all time favorite i think oh uh-huh i like i like that one too but i thought Young Frankenstein was better yeah that that was just you know had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie i just really enjoyed it did you and uh um i'm trying to think because we saw another one that we thought was really good early this summer that was a suspenseful movie i'm trying to remember what it was because it you know it's  okay i guess our topic is um advice about going to college do you have children of your own uh-huh oh no i don't have any children but i'm still going to college uh-huh NC State oh are you what school are you going to oh are you enjoying it um well it's a lot of work are you working on your um my Bachelor's uh-huh Bachelor's degree and what field of study are you in um it's actually in computer science and i have a special interest in Voice IO uh-huh oh well that's neat are you from North Carolina no i'm actually from Amarillo Texas originally oh are you really oh uh-huh well what took you to North Carolina um the service oh i see yeah well that was one of the things i was thinking about in school um when i went to Texas Tech out in Lubbock uh-huh and uh i had a friend my roommate went to Tech also but she was from New Mexico uh-huh and she had to pay out of state tuition and i think that would have uh played a real big part in my decision ooh it would have played a major part in mine yeah because um she was paying of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now it was like four dollars a semester hour uh-huh and so i was going to school for you know just a few hundred dollars a semester and she was paying forty dollars an hour so she's paying ten times as much because she was out of state golly yeah luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time oh that's good yeah so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider try to find a school within the state that um i liked well enough to attend um-hum um uh-huh the second thing is some colleges only offer the uh Liberal Arts uh-huh and uh whereas like State they offer engineering courses right yeah so depending on what your major is or medical you might want to atteck somewhere um attend somewhere like Tech yeah right and um aside from the uh well some schools may even give you financial aid where another one won't yeah that's true that was something else i had was i had government aid of course but uh it was wonderful because i got one of those grants that you don't have to repay oh really and yeah it was so nice it paid most of my tuition and um a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing so yeah i really hm wow that's great was it a Pell grant i'm sorry what did you say what kind of grant was it well it was called a BEOG a Basic Equal Opportunity Grant and it was from the government and it was based at first it was based on my parents' income my parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to uh-huh send any of us to school and so uh because based on the number of children and the amount of money uh um-hum my father brought in i got a small grant but then after that i was on my own working and you know trying to go to school on my own um-hum so then i got a real big grant because the amount of money i was making really didn't compare wow uh-huh so it was kind of nice i don't know if those are still available or not but hm uh i'm not quite there's there's a lot of different organizations who uh who do give grants but uh i'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how how much that they you know they generally run yeah yeah well this was great it was just based on you know how much your tuition costs and everything and generally it paid everything so i went to school about three years of my four for almost nothing so that was um-hum golly that's great yeah it was really nice oh another thing i've got a i've got a degree from another college and uh something that might play a part is the size of the college uh-huh right uh lots the smaller schools can give you a lot uh a lot more specialized instruction and attention than the larger schools in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy and um-hum yeah um-hum and they just give you a teacher's assistants you know instead of a scholar you get a TA um-hum that's right and uh you don't get near the uh quality of education and as well the uh smaller schools often times don't cost as much hm i didn't know that oh yeah well i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between um a Christian college because i thought about attending Abilene Christian instead of Texas Tech um-hum um-hum and of course the price was just astronomical compared to Tech um the Christian college was so much more expensive hm but i guess some of the other colleges smaller colleges might might be a lot different um oh i at State i think it's just a waste of somebody's money to go there really it's really a shame because of you know the instruction um i'd rather go to any other college you know in the state and i would definitely get my money's worth uh much better than State yeah um-hum yeah huh it's kind of unfortunate because they've they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students anymore yeah yeah you're just a number yeah they're they're bent on uh seeing how much land how much more land they can get and how much uh how much of the campus they can build up um right and uh yeah it's really a bad situation here yeah oh that's a shame well i i felt a little cheated at Tech also once i got into my i um major ed in  okay well uh some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've where i've um learned things that i'm going to do for my children for Christmas um-hum and they were really uh helpful because i didn't know how to do this one stitching and so that was very helpful to me as far as books otherwise um i like to read children's books and things like that what about you oh goodness well i was an English major so i like to read period oh uh lately i've been on the whole very practical and uh i'm trying uh to to uh furnish a home hm so i've been looking at i'm not sure reading is the word but looking at books on uh antiques and paintings and uh interior decoration hints uh-huh and uh lots of books on plants and and and gardens because we started a garden oh and things things like that and so i've been doing very little reading except i i did finally dip into a couple of biographies um all of sort of literary figures of this century uh-huh it's interesting that you said that my husband and i had uh took a book out of the library about gardening too and started a garden a fall garden oh um with good for you i haven't gotten around to that oh yeah and our our uh cantaloupes and and um peppers and tomatoes are on right now so it's been really fun and and we learned that you know um some of the gardening skills we had were before but some of them we learned from a book uh-huh and so that was helpful to us now i've read two books uh that were uh nonfiction lately and uh yes i well one was nonfiction and one was fiction and the fiction one uh was about a boy in uh during the time of Adolf Hitler hm and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp hm and that was not enjoyment that that was too realistic and really um mind no a real eye opener uh and i guess it's good to read those things too uh but i didn't enjoy it necessarily um-hum and uh the other one was quite enjoyable it was uh about a a Chinese lady and her generations down her what happened to her family through the years oh so that one was good i think all of uh well even if they're not enjoyable they bring you uh a some kind of of learning so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that so i i i like to read the the children's books i think that's the most animated and imaginative so i like those a lot uh what are your favorite children's books oh there are a couple of Newbery Award winners uh A Wrinkle in Time is one and i don't know if you've ever read that but but um um-hum no oh there's one about an Indian girl and i can't think of that Island of the Blue Dolphins is another hm and that's a good one now some of the ones that have just received the awards this year i haven't read and i would like to read those um-hum but uh it's funny because i've read some from like nineteen twenty three and nineteen forty five and things like that um-hum and i didn't enjoy those as much and i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what but uh that's interesting i i i well i mean you can't be an English major major unless you like reading things from the past yeah so i've read a a great deal of old things i tend to go go back i don't have any children uh-huh so i don't read the new ones but i occasionally if no one's looking uh-huh dip into something like Winnie the Pooh or uh-huh no even that's good or uh uh the the Grimm's Fairy Tales or something like that um-hum um just because it's sheer magic yeah uh my children and i uh i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went uh-huh to bed at night and there was one called The Pig Princess and it was a a princess from a long long time ago and she came through a a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig um sty and the people that she came to were just hm farm people and she didn't understand them and they didn't understand her but it came together in this book and it was really a lot of fun yes yes i think that uh we we  Carolyn i have a little Schnauzer little miniature Schnauzer oh what do you have well it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society uh you know those make the best animals uh pets best pets my uh son has a uh oh it's a real mixture it's part uh Doberman and part Husky yes and they gentlest dog you ever met and they got him from the uh Humane Society here in Oklahoma City oh my oh and she's just turned out to be a jewel my my little Schnauzer is is my friend she is so spoiled she's a year and a half old now and being single she's become very important in my life uh-huh it's so nice to have come home and find something or someone who's really so happy to see you well my children are the ones that wanted our pet and this one is probably the best one that we have had um as i say we got it from the Humane Society and uh we had lost a pet and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost it got out under the fence while we were on vacation and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it but uh when we walked in to the to the Humane Society this little dog was uh in the office and would sit up and beg and just oh he was so cute and the kids just fell in love with it we just couldn't leave without it but it's um whoever had it before must have trained it real well because it's just you know it's uh a good house dog i've never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it sometimes i wish i had not gotten this one as a puppy because i work and i'm not home uh-huh and unfortunately she's not as well trained as as i would like her to be um-hum and i realize it's my fault i'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian but uh it's hard to do that when you're not there constantly it is it is she's you know she's real good i can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside hm oh and she'll stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom hm i just want to kill her at those times oh but she's a doll she's a love she really is about the only time we have well i shouldn't say the only time but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night and uh she usually stays inside at night we try to take her out right before we go to sleep but uh sometimes it doesn't work you know i i we always had a pet when i was growing up oh always had a dog my mother did not like cats so we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it's because the children wanted the pet um-hum and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog oh i uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas what a cute idea yeah i think so well we got one one year for Christmas and uh i had a baby the next day oh my goodness and uh so that one wasn't really well trained two babies huh oh oh i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so that that is really probably bad timing yeah i think it was it really was The older kids had wanted one though and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to have it you know get it at Christmas time it was a little Spitz with a little white oh yes fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the North Pole and that was fun but um i I sure wasn't good at training it uh-huh do you i think you have to have time you know to to do those things and patience and you have to you really have to be just like your children when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent that's right and  what what do you feel is the the major change that's been going on that's a tough question we're now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right i think that has been the major change is that don't ask me women feel they need to go out and do this they they no longer feel it's um it's no big deal to to stay home and raise your family anymore well it has no credibility anymore i know it and i i think i think that's really sad because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else well i'm a school teacher and i'm in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it you don't well i'm i'm still home with with my last one and i wouldn't trade change a minute of it for anything oh good for you good for you but i i can't i can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again well you know it's interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking uh this summer Oprah had a TV show um-hum about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible and one woman had four children and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family and that's frightening oh yeah that's yeah it it's sad and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue yeah people were siding with the husband saying you've got to go to work if you have these four children you've got to support them um-hum and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them uh-huh yeah i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary that's true uh you know to i i don't think you know the kids don't benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever that's true uh but i i uh i i don't know i i see it as a major problem and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and um-hum gosh i'm trying to think i don't know i have one woman one mother that i know is home but she also has ten children what what grade do you teach six seven and eight six seven and eight i've got a child uh where do you live are you out in Richardson in Richardson we're in Plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and uh i know there aren't very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see oh okay um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are are left alone too much and oh yes yeah i've got one child um that stays with me everyday till five because his mother doesn't come home until seven and he doesn't wanna to be home from three thirty to seven by himself he stays at school and the school allows that um-hum well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late i work till six uh-huh um-hum so he stays with me till five thirty and then goes home and you know i have lots of kids because they know i'm there late i'm a slow mover to say the least but um they'll come in and say can i stay with you because i don't wanna go home to an empty house oh my um-hum oh and that's frightening because you know the when i said i i'm i'm raising them i am because we're talking about boyfriends and we're talking about what the girl said in class and you know what's right because there's no mother at home to do it um-hum no mother to talk to and um it makes a difference i've and just the social values well i've do you do you feel it will swing back the other way or do you feel there's just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations i i don't know i i have a feeling we're gonna go more and more i've got a twenty one year old female and i've got twenty two year old male children child children and um-hum i listen to my daughter and she's going to work and she's going to buy her house and she's gonna get her car and then she's gonna have her children and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is um-hum and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things yeah and we live without them we did fine  why don't you go ahead and say what you feel and then i'll respond all right well i'm uh i'm very guilty of of not doing my part with recycling i'm afraid we um recently moved here from North Carolina and they had curbside recycling and it was very easy put everything out there but we don't have it in at least in our neighborhood right now yeah and uh so i've been very guilty about not making the effort to to take things where they belong well how long have you been here well we've been here since January so we we still feel very new but i it's working up to a year now so i guess we're old-timers compared to some people well yeah yeah i think that's a good excuse you need to get into the the system a little more and know where to take things uh yeah we've been here probably two and a half years and and we didn't recycle at all before we came so i think we're doing well we we've saved most of our aluminum cans and glass and newspaper right now uh-huh uh-huh where do you take those things well the um glass and the newspaper we usually take to Wal-Mart they have um in behind Wal-Mart they have bins uh-huh and then we usually save up our cans and and change them in for money where do you do that because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir um but i didn't know where to take them um-hum um there's a place on Parker Road um it's just over the overpass before you get like to KMart i think there's a a service station there there's usually a semi truck that has a a person there that will weigh them and oh now they aren't worth much right now but it's better than nothing so and yeah better than nothing right what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the the pickup now and we hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of October yeah i it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that you know it's coming in a couple of months but yeah and i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for February but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with oh from what i've read in you know the mail that we get and i can't wait for that that will be easy i get tired of newspaper littering the garage right yeah yeah it gets to be a bit much before haul it off but i feel guilty we don't recycle our our milk containers because they seem like a big waste well they do yeah they they're a lot of bulk anyway and yeah yeah yeah they fill up the whole kitchen garbage pail so i'll be glad when the bins do come and i think that's when i'll i'll start doing the plastic too right yeah it was real easy with the bins it really was and it was it was just no effort at all um no more trouble than taking out the garbage so um i yeah i've gotten used to washing the you know the um salad dressing bottles and things like that it's not that big of a deal i mean it's nicer to just throw them out but we can do our part take an extra minute or two right yeah yeah well how much do you earn on the cans i i didn't know how what kind of an idea to give her for oh when we first were were here it was like we'd take maybe a oh a grocery sack full or maybe two grocery sacks full and it'd be like two dollars uh-huh yeah but since last time we've gotten more like a dollar so it's gone down yeah yeah which is understandable i think more people are are recycling but that's something that we we don't really make any effort to right yeah and whatever pop we drink we used to take the boys out for a bike ride and pick up the litter you know the the cans and that was kind of fun but we haven't done that for a long time uh-huh yeah so well that sounds like a pretty good project well well the boys think it's fun plus you get your exercise and you you do get to stop once in a while when there is a can to rest so but oh well i'll i'll have to kick myself and and get get on it my neighbor across the street um is so careful about recycling and so i um-hum keep telling myself i'll i'll get it organized but maybe maybe they'll beat me and and do the city wide first and well hopefully the bins will be here in this month and that will spur you on so all right well it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting so right right i don't have any excuse then that's for sure thinking about it anyway yeah but well um have you do they time this thing for us or do we yeah trying that's all you can do so that um yeah you can do it as long as you want they you know if it's been long enough five minutes is is when they cut in and say say we don't have anymore room for recording so so we can say good-bye now it was good talking to you and maybe we'll get on line again thanks Sherry bye-bye you can't you can't chat all day huh okay okay bye-bye  okay so you said that you live in Coppell um-hum so what is your house like it's a two bedroom two bath duplex brick oh well that's neat uh-huh is it one that you're renting or buying oh and uh no we own it yeah well our side uh-huh uh-huh yeah yeah well that's kind of neat that you can even though it's a duplex you can still buy that's good do you have any children uh-huh yeah no huh-uh do you yes i have two children and our home is really too small for us right now um-hum ours is too we outgrew it when we moved in yeah we moved from an apartment that was really small and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old uh-huh uh-huh and we moved into this house in Garland it's in one of the older areas of town and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere and uh-huh um-hum you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty but the the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet um yeah oh wow yeah it's real little y'all are cramped yeah and now i have a daughter now my the one that was five months old is seven years old and the one and i have another one that's three and a half and i have all these clothes and toys and stuff that we're just trying to find places to put uh-huh uh-huh wow uh-huh how many bedrooms is it well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a a built on addition room you know but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet uh-huh uh-huh ah so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and you know it's kind of a catchall room um-hum uh-huh but it sure is nice to have it yeah when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff so uh-huh how fun yeah that works out good and i'm thankful i have two girls because they're in bunk beds and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way uh-huh uh-huh and how old's the youngest she's three and a half yeah um-hum so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know and uh-huh um-hum um-hum uh we're going to have to figure out a new idea but we're we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home and uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so so that would be nice yeah yeah that's what we'd like to do yeah is Coppell a nice area to live oh it's wonderful place to live and they i don't have any kids so i don't really know but they say that we have wonderful schools well i think i've heard a lot uh about Coppell schools that they're real good and that's neat do you do you hope to have children or are you not planning on having any or ah i see well do you have any pets um-hum um-hum um-hum um nah i don't think so nah oh of course those are my kids i have two dogs uh yeah ah so do they stay inside or ah well that's neat yeah they're inside dogs they're my babies yeah well what are the colors in your house uh um kind of a mauve and gray oh i bet that's pretty um-hum and then the kitchen's kind of a a country pink and country blue and uh-huh it's all done in cows i'm a cow nut oh well that's neat i like cows too uh-huh yeah well our house was redone uh our house is very old also it's like thirty seven years old yeah and it was redone before we moved in which i'm so uh-huh wow thankful for that but the it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in you know everything is like yeah yeah the carpet's kind of a tan and brown and has um um-hum paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that you know so um-hum oh yeah yeah uh that's worked out good in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper and had done it up with blues so that's nice that's uh-huh oh sounds pretty yeah yeah we've enjoyed living here it's it's close to my uh oldest daughter's school and that makes it really handy too oh um-hum um-hum and she really likes her school so and we're so close to shopping and just well good that's an important factor there yeah what uh how about in Coppell i've always imagined it kind of out away from everything well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville and that's just like a mile or two from our house oh really oh well that's nice but when we first moved to Coppell it's what six years ago we didn't even have a grocery store oh wow and now we have four and Coppell's not really big enough to support four four grocery stores oh yeah yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing so oh much very much in fact it's about the size now i moved down here from Chicago what twenty three years ago and to Lewisville yeah oh uh-huh uh-huh and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when when i moved down here oh i see well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock and we almost moved to Lewisville that was our second choice yeah behind Garland we at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home uh-huh oh really  hello hello hi my name's Gail i'm calling from Texas hi i'm Sandy i'm in Texas too oh what a deal hm took long enough to find you oh really yeah seems like they take forever any more but um so did you hear what the topic was did she tell you okay yes yeah great well if you're ready then uh i'll just go ahead and start okay hold on okay okay well i guess we're supposed to talk about the changing roles of women yeah seems like um to me everything is just changing so much that it's almost like um you can't keep up with things any more and everything is uh there everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women i personally i'm a stay home mom and i like it the way it used to be so am i are you i you know i think it's kind of coming back around to that don't you i mean that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do you know yeah i don't know i mean i think sometimes some of the the women's lib though is kind of like they wanted it all you know and you can't have everything um-hum i don't i don't think that you can have i mean there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i wanna be yeah and to me that's more important how how many kids do you have two are they young or two um-hum five and two five and two i have two and mine are two and nine months so um being being home is real i i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home and uh i just it's just weird that i was just talking to somebody this morning who's who's a working uh lady a working mom and you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like um she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care and uh i just think i i i just don't agree with that i think it should be that people should get back to staying home and and being family more family oriented than than not you know it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other and i hope it just doesn't get to where you know there's more women more and more women going into the work force well i agree i mean but i i hate for them to make people feel bad that have to work too saying you know you should stay home you know otherwise your children aren't going to you know turn out or whatever because that's not fair to yeah you know like the single moms that have to work or if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet um-hum not working or whatever i mean i think it's got to be a personal choice and it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home yeah well i find that i whenever i have to whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things like just over the weekend i visited my family and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing and uh you know well i had my baby with me and i found that all i talked about was my baby which was fine with me but it's like you know here these people are they're going to school getting degrees making all this money and you know they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages you know like i because i didn't have really all that much to talk about uh where career and things like that were concerned i mean you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while yeah in social situations sometimes which is too bad because you know i i feel like i don't obviously i don't get paid for my job but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home that's what i figure i'm worth a lot as for what i do yeah every day but you know i don't know he's kind of a um at at least here i've noticed i'm not from here i'm from Colorado but i've really noticed that there are a lot of uh a lot more people that are more comfortable at least with some women being home and at least in the circles i've traveled and in the church that i go to you know that men don't treat you like you don't know anything generally yeah speaking well and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or you know even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff and i think that's really important yeah that that they do that and they realize there's a need for that and um i don't know i found when i did do some work when my son was young it was like contract work and it wasn't where i had to be there every day but i mean we're going to the doctor once a week so i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor yeah yeah i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem definitely well  well do you have any pets yes i do i have a dog named Grisly who's a ten year old uh mixed breed between Golden Retriever Afghan Hound and Chow and i have a pair of box turtles oh oh i used to have box turtles um well years ago when i was growing up i yeah i really liked them um oh yeah i do too Lucky and Spot that's their names and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle and always has his nose all around my turtle box oh so do you have any pets now yes um we have one dog a Bichon Frise um our friends in Houston bred the dogs i had never heard of them no i haven't either they're um they're all white and they're small and um and fluffy they don't shed i guess they are distantly related to a poodle but they're not very well known in this country and they're not um high strung or over bred oh and how big do they get um ours is uh on the small end and she's about ten pounds and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds oh that's interesting and they love people um and kids and that was something we were looking for um our our love is Golden Retrievers and that's what we had intended to get in Houston but we had a small yard and a pool and knowing how they love to dig and love the water um and we thought that was kind of a tough climate yes the water yes yeah so uh we ended up getting this and uh my son would rather have a Golden Retriever though i think now he wants a oh a good size dog uh-huh well we've got a good size dog and we were considering getting a puppy a small house lap top dog for him because he likes other animals and for me because we used to have a miniature Dachshund and i miss having a little one oh yeah you know around the kind you have sounds very interesting though what they really are um they're really sweet dogs we've uh we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of um the family that had them and and bred them they had five litters of puppies and and a lot of them stayed in the neighborhood because um oh uh-huh and how do you spell that breed they it's B I C H O N F R I S E F R I S E and how do you pronounce that Bichon Frise okay i'm writing it out phonetically yeah they're uh and they don't shed so they're they're good dogs for people with with allergies and they love people i mean they're yes do they bark a lot um no not really ours um ours barks more than uh than some because she spent a lot of time at our friends house we used to swap back and forth dogs that they have three dogs they had a Cockapoo and and two Bichons um uh-huh and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there and and um oh now it's funny she's she's a good watch dog i mean if there's uh-huh um she'll bark that way but she also talk a lot she yes um has a definite personality and so if we're leaving her she barks at us because she doesn't want to be left um oh does she ever mess in the house no no and they're um they're very smart dogs the circuses in Europe used to use them um for the acts they uh oh oh they'll dance on their hind legs each uh-huh oh gee um but they're very easy to train and uh-huh and about how much are they well they range i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars i think which i thought was a lot and how about the and how about the person in uh Houston well she's no longer breeding them but um because her dogs um oh the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem uh-huh and so she only bred that dog once because it had the tooth problem and did them strictly as um pets you know they weren't weren't show quality oh yes just pets yes that's what we'd rather have is just a pet instead of we used to show Saint Bernards when i was a little girl we did that every weekend right oh but yeah it takes a lot of time um yes and it's very expensive yeah um but she might have some contacts here i know originally i know that the dog's grandmother um was from Plano oh that's where i live oh that's where i live too yeah i'm at Coit and Legacy  do you have any pets yeah i have five cats two dogs a snake and a bunny holy Nellie that's enough to keep anybody busy with pets how about you i oh i guess we have one miniature Dachshund um i think i'm envious oh i don't think i could cope with that many how do how do you uh avoid having your house smell well my cats are indoor outdoor cats and i don't know i hadn't really thought about it one thing is to keep everything clean i mean you have to keep cages like for the rabbit you have to keep it cleaned and you have to keep litter boxes scooped um-hum but most of my cats go outside so there's not that much there i only have one who stays inside um do you let your rabbit run around loose oh no it's in a cage lot of people do but i've never been able to quite handle that with a rabbit okay i i knew somebody who said they were easy to uh litter box train but she had trouble with it chewing on wood no i've never i've never even tried it to be honest with you it's really my daughter's rabbit oh how what kind of a dog do you have um i have i have one that's kind of a Golden Retriever mutt that means a mix and then my daughter just got an American Eskimo um-hum uh do they get along and oh yeah oh yeah all my cats and my dogs and even the rabbit and the dogs and the cats everybody in my house gets along except the snake he kind of keeps to himself see we our dog hates every other animal and our we have a couple children that are are grown and on their own and every once in a while they will come home for a visit with an animal right and our our dog just about has a stroke well he's probably older and he's used to being the only dog and it's hard for him just like people it's hard for them to give up their well their place as the only one and kind of share the attention but almost all of my animals are used to not being the only one in the house and so they're kind of used to being part of a group um-hum well we we kind of joke that that our our dog's about eight years old and but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a Golden Retriever uh-huh and uh when he left you know we swear the our dog's muzzle turned white and then uh our our other son is in the Navy and was being relocated to go to school down at College Station so he was here for a couple days in between waiting for his household goods and stuff and with a beagle puppy and we swear after she left the dog got gray on the front two feet you know maybe he's just getting old i don't know but it seems a a a visit from uh one of his cousins uh tends to uh really really affect how he is turns him gray one of the things they mentioned was why do you think people have pets well i think they're i think they're good company i have been trying for years to convince my mother who lives alone that she would like a a dog she loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap you know and she'll just sit there and pet him and pet him and i'll say you need an animal he would i think so too i really think that they are wonderful therapy they're they're just companionship i'm and yes um-hum obviously i'm a i'm a real believer in them well and i i think they're good for kids in that they can teach the kids responsibility you know if if you if you have a a kid who wants an animal badly enough and agrees to take care of it i mean it's a responsibility cleaning up after it and yes i think so too um you feeding it making sure it has water and uh you know just just all that kind of stuff that's that's good also uh feeding it that's right but we just have a we we in the past we've had Great Danes ooh that's a big dog which were probably the best pets we've ever had really yeah oh they were well the first one we had was wonderful she just finally died of old age but she was just so the the greatest house pet and uh we were asked when she was probably about ten years old when our our youngest one was born and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of sniff and walk walk out of the room and would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until uh she got old enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over oh yeah yet and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay but yeah but then my husband decided it would might be nice to have a lap dog for a change um here's a source yeah now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches TV and sits in his recliner and falls asleep sure that's neat that's neat uh what what  hi well i still don't trust them i'm sorry you don't i probably never will i don't i don't think they have enough control to really uh to really do anything against us i think i don't think they're as strong as we think they are personally but yeah but i see what i see your point because you know they they feed us propaganda uh-huh and we never know what they're thinking that's right i don't trust maybe i guess it's because of the way what happened over there with their own people how they threw him out of power and you know just a big uproar but then you know me and my husband always talk about it because they're running out of money right sure you know and what are they going to do when they run out of food are they going to just attack us and take it it makes you wonder right because you know we already we have enough problems over here that we don't need to be trying to help everybody else which that that gets on my nerves too but right well i think taking you know when we took that uh went to war with Iraq i think we that was kind of a uh display of power yeah and i think we showed i think the Soviet Union knows what we have and knows that we're pretty serious and if they ever tried to do anything we would we would be on the offensive yeah but i don't i think they have just as much see but i don't know i i think that they have better like we you know when we go over in Iraq and Iran that's different country but i think see that's why they don't have anything in the Soviet Union they spent more money on um what do you call um military power than anything they have more of a expense of military than we do yeah but are they going to have the backing from the people you know well now see that's another problem is they have it in their own thing with all this uh what do you call it uh breaking up of the Soviet Union right now i doubt if they had a help of anybody in their country right right because there's fifteen different republics they're having so many right now it's like whoa so i don't know if they would have yeah you know but it just depends on when right they do it so i guess it would depend on what what state that they're in right when they do it but i still wouldn't trust them not i would trust them only so much well right i don't i don't even think we should you know i i don't think it's a matter of trust even anymore i mean it's just okay you lay this down we'll lay this down but that doesn't mean we we're not we're going to stop watching you and making sure you're not um-hum you know doing what you supposed to do right but i think that's what they're trying to do is to get us to do everything you know and them not really do anything because who's checking them i don't know you know i think that not only if we check them they're not going it's just like coming over here in the United States the government don't tell you everything i know it they feel they don't have to which i agree right because if you tell everybody everything everybody in the world would know because they'd put it on TV right and that wouldn't do us any good so right i just a you know that that's another thing that scares me is our country they're so into TV you know what are we doing um-hum what are they actually telling us and after you know what happened the other day with that uh CIA guy you know um-hum how much is what all the wars we're getting into and all this you know the messes we're we're involving us ourselves with that we really don't that we don't know about right is that true or you know is it was Panama really a threat how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda right you know what are what are what are we supposed to believe right but i don't i don't trust the government here more than i trust you know to a point that's the thing i'm having a hard time with but then just like i'm not going to trust another government just because right there's no way especially when they've been such a oh a power to us you know a force that we have to watch constantly a threat but yet now they're going to be our friends right um-hum no that's like Little Red Riding Hood to me huh you know letting the wolf in and saying oh that's okay yeah really we're going to sit here but we're not we're going to watch each other and i think whoever wins the the wait is probably the one well if it just keeps on going and nobody ever does anything that's fine with me yeah as long as i don't care about that they can do whatever they want but i don't want it to get to  well how did you like that topic uh i don't know i've got mixed feelings about the topic do you i don't no okay no i'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know i agree with it i think uh i think a company should be able to test at any any employee anytime they see fit i just i just don't think there's a place in our environment environment you know in the work well force for drugs or alcohol either well i don't believe in drugs or alcohol but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the TCAT right they were talking about drug testing us uh-huh and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine uh-huh and we found it belittling you did uh-huh yeah well i can sort of understand that uh but not being a teacher as you are you know i i was not quite as sympathetic as you know as i probably would have been if if Kay were a teacher or something that's true but uh but then you know at the same token i'm not against because i look at airline pilots uh-huh bus drivers uh-huh you know people that really have other peoples' lives in their hands truck drivers it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs that's right that's right that's that's right and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs from what you read you know but uh and alcohol and you know in those areas i really you know do believe that maybe we should clean up our you know house yeah i think so too i i agree with it uh i know Kay's company you know they started it couple of years ago and so many of the people even the professional people were boy they were so against them doing that you know and i thought jeez to me it's quite simple uh you either need a job or you don't the the job is what provides all of your needs and uh if they say hey you can't do this work i'd say hey i agree i don't i won't do that and i think most of them have agreed to that now although they didn't like it at first yeah i think it's just like anything else a new concept you know as i had said if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted yeah it it it is i can see where you would think yeah that is belittling you know i'd probably feel the same way if i had to do that but at the same token in education we can't do drug drug random drug testing on kids yeah that's true you know i mean their rights are protected you bet oh gosh they would they would really raise a stink if that was to happen what well but why if you're going to do teachers or professionals why not do the kids when we see them and they're you know under the influence right yes i agree with that i i i wouldn't be opposed to it at all it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth tooth and nail you know that's true but uh well Lynn i've enjoyed talking with you i don't know how long we're supposed to carry on a conversation do you it's three minutes and the clicker comes in when it's time to oh well we'd better keep talking because i've not heard it have we have you heard it yeah no anyway we both a sort of agree on it don't we about about random testing yeah well do we agree or unless it's it's not me you know here we go again i mean well you see i yeah yeah if you agree yeah you know i believe that truck drivers and people that have even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands and if they come in stoned or they come in drunk yeah and there was an incident in my children's high school where a teacher stayed drunk is that right uh-huh you just don't think of that happening with teachers and yet i really don't i when i think of drug testing i'm thinking of the uh you know outside of education uh well no it you know we are as susceptible a society as anybody else sure sure i know that but uh you don't think of that first hand normally and uh yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation isn't that it was on the news tonight isn't that mind boggling goodness it it is it's mind boggling and well you know i agree with you i know teachers are just like everybody else same problems the same uh good qualities as anybody else yeah then i think you know if it came push came to shove i'd probably be drug tested yeah yeah you know because it does you know you you think the benefit would be greater than the yeah because you know as i say i'm sitting there fussing and fussing and yet i know of you know one teacher who was an alcoholic uh-huh in school as well as you know i presume out and that was in your children's high school isn't that amazing um-hum and you know my children brought it to my attention i never was there to see it if it if it's if it was true there i'm sure it's true with just about probably to some degree every school there is um-hum you know because they represent a pretty good uh and that's not giving a good example to students no certainly not uh certainly not they don't need that example but  okay have you seen any good movies lately uh um uh let's see yeah what have what have you seen lately uh Dances With Wolves we just saw that kind of late what else have i seen uh Silence of the Lambs oh uh-huh yeah that was a good movie we saw that one too that was that was uh spine tingling yeah uh in fact i can't wait to see it again it should be be in release pretty soon i think yeap are are we being are we doing are we recording i've not done this before oh you haven't no yeah we are being recorded okay so uh let's see i guess the only ones i've seen recently have been i saw Naked Gun Two and a half um-hum how was that that was that was pretty good that was enjoyable yeah i i didn't think it was quite as good as the first one yeah my son my teenage son liked it so i wasn't quite sure how to take that whether i would whether i would like it our not yeah it was it was pretty clever yeah and then we saw the one that was the kind of the spoof of Top Gun um-hum there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didn't enjoy that one near as much i didn't it wasn't as well done i don't think um-hum but uh and i'm trying to remember we've seen some other goods ones but uh and and then Silence of the Lambs that one kept me thinking for a month yeah that was uh almost to uh to spine tingling for me i i liked it but it was uh yeah yeah it was it was interesting because the person i thought that that really you know stole the show was Anthony Hopkins oh yeah and he was so good in that yeah he definitely he definitely did i saw him in uh did you see him when he played uh Adolf Hitler no i didn't oh boy that was uh he also i mean he he was outstanding act too yeah it's it's amazing how because i mean realistically he wasn't in that movie but you know twenty minutes uh uh-huh and yet you know he just captivated yeap it it was amazing it really was yeah you're right uh you don't think uh he was so dominating dominating you don't think about it but he was on screen not any where near as long as right i it know but he is the one that kept you thinking throughout the whole movie yep yep and uh that that was that was really a good movie i really enjoyed that one yep how did you like Dances With Wolves did you like that one uh we haven't seen that one yet yeah i i haven't mustered up enough strength to go sit through a three hour movie oh you haven't yeah so i i i run out of patience on a movie like that i start checking my watch about an hour and half is that right yeah yeah hm well it kept me uh i it kept me uh interested the whole time yeah really i've heard i've heard it's really good i haven't gone to see it probably be out on tape before long too yeah it's out yeah yeah we didn't see it at the theater we waited till it came out too is it oh oh i see how about Robin Hood have you seen that one me neither no me neither um i really want to see that one it's and it about to come out in on uh Kevin Costner yeah the Kevin Costner movie is that what you are talking about yeah um uh i really like him i have somehow that movie never grabbed me you know as one that i would like to see but uh on huh yeah yeah uh-huh it did it uh well really interested me until the reviews started coming out and they were sort of um did they pan it pretty bad or no they it it um they said uh that he was um he's he's performance was only average and um and and i read i read some interviews with him that he was the production was rushed so much that he didn't he evidently he studies his uh his parts real in depth um-hum and uh at least that's what the article said and it was rushing the production he and he he was in intention to master a British accent for it and didn't have time to do that hm and then they said there were some wholes in the story line too oh so something i saw on Showtime or something the other night the i hadn't hadn't seen in a while was uh was The Hunt for Red October did you see that yeah i like that one i've seen i've seen that i saw it about i saw it once and i've seen it about four times on cable yeah me too i'm the same way and that that's really an intriguing movie too yeah yeah that's a good one there there are several like that uh another one i saw that me and my wife really talked about after it was over was uh Sex Lies and Videotape oh yeah no i've only seen uh like uh did you see that bits and pieces of it yeah i was traveling and and you know it was in the hotel and i and i saw little bits and pieces of it was that was that was that any good or was it just exploit it wasn't bad the thing was you know it was interesting the way the their lives intertwined and and and then at the end they kind of all fell apart and you know there are a lot of things to talk about after that you know because it was real interesting um-hum the interpersonal relationship and stuff yeah so it it was a movie that we you know we end up when when you first leave there it's like you know i don't know if i like that movie but then as we get to talk about it its like all these different things that deal with these people or whatever um-hum so it wasn't an exploitation film uh no not not at all if that's what is sounds like yeah but it's not that at all uh it just it talks about it it's basically only got four people in the whole movie and uh you know the whole the whole thing just revolves around them and you know uh really i mean uh-huh  my name's Mary Dell and i live in the Dallas Texas area where there's a lot of pollution okay and i'm up in Wisconsin uh my name is Terry oh uh-huh and uh in the small town we don't but uh we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution yes okay i'll go ahead and start recording that okay okay um just in particular here in the Twin Cities we have a lot of big corporations and um i'm sure there's a lot of pollution we uh before moving to Wisconsin lived across from where they were um oh gravel pits and also where they were making tar and so we would occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar and um-hum ooh it would uh smell the continuous you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs so and it was like miles away but just the idea of having that right come across the way it did in the wind kind of made you know that there was a lot of pollution and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that but um-hum um-hum also um where we also lived too it was very close to a highway so we got a lot of fumes from uh trucks um-hum and cars and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture i mean it was on your tables you would dust every day and it was dirty um oh gosh type of uh dust i mean it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country um-hum um-hum um i live in a small um town now quite a ways from the Twin Cities about an hour away and i may dust once a week and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city huh i'd never thought about that being a cause i have to dust a lot as well so oh yeah it it comes right on through through the screens the only way that you could yeah actually live in the in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home that would take the air from the outside and clean the air before it would get into the house um-hum my goodness and so it was quite a dirty city um if if you were well protected by trees which catch a lot of the pollution um-hum then you're fine but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution and it's just going for miles and miles and miles and it's landing somewhere with the wind but um-hum that's kind of the way Dallas is we're so flat and open and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation trees it was all cotton fields so sure sure we don't have that advantage and ours i think is primarily cars where we don't carpool like we should yes yes an airport i work in a building i'm nineteen floors up and i look out toward DFW International and there's just an awful brown haze all the time uh-huh uh-huh and i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport oh sure sure yeah it's i mean our air quality um in the Twin Cities is a lot better than what we've heard about California and maybe in um-hum the other areas but um they were always talking about the air quality of today is this you know the ozone or whatever and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted yes and many people are too busy getting to work not thinking about okay i could have carpooled with a friend even um-hum my husband was uh talking to some of the guys at work now he's uh fifteen miles away from work but he was talking wouldn't it be nice to carpool and the guy says well it's too close it wouldn't pay and so um-hum want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear yeah and exactly exactly and so my husband says well that's fine you know it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars and you know the gas um-hum and no everybody has their preference to drive by themselves or if they do they they drive with one little buddy uh at least it's with one person but most of the time people are saying forget it i don't want to carpool it's too much of a hassle it's too much involvement but yet um-hum but we're paying for it yes we are and i think of my daughter and i'm sure you think of your children and you kind of say to yourself what kind of future will they have when they think back and say well my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference and i think people are trying um-hum but they have to change attitudes and it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections than we had growing up um-hum sure you can really see it i i had a chance to go to Bolivia a couple years ago and of course there's no industry um-hum very little trash they they don't even have that much that they burn because they consume everything down to the thread and it amazed me i i just had totally forgotten how blessed sure sure well they  okay so we're going to talk about uh what kind of clothes we wear while we work okay i'm ready uh-huh do you work for TI no i work at home oh you do well you're like me then i stay home also do you have children yes i have two a seven year old and three and a half year old oh that's good how about you i have four girls they're nine and five and three and a newborn oh oh my you are busy yes and they're all girls i have two girls so all girls around here yes uh really sweet girls are nice aren't they anyway as far as clothing goes um my wardrobe changes all the time depending on my size we go from regular kind of spring clothes that's how i am too um-hum regular kind of fall clothes pregnant clothes uh-huh clothes that are in between where you're not down to regular size yet uh-huh or you're on your way up from regular size and they're all in boxes or bags and they all rotate all the time oh that's funny yeah kind of the same stuff all the time though i don't uh get a whole lot new right now yeah yeah i know that's kind of how i am i said who ever i talk to is going to be bored because when it's summer time i'm wearing shorts and when it's cold i'm wearing sweat pants and yeah most of unless i'm going to something special that my daughter's doing or something like that i yeah i i like jeans a lot well that's that's good i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places so oh and it's it's frustrating i just i find i have to get the right kinds though or it's not comfortable yeah they it it works best if they have pleats in the front right yeah and uh they have to my waist is kind of small compared to the hips so it has to be not the straight up and down Levi's kind yeah yeah i know what you mean well but um but i when i was i was pregnant through the summer this time and i wore dresses all the time because it was so much cooler and so much more comfortable not to have something binding on your waist oh uh-huh right uh-huh that's right but um one of my daughters was born in June and i remember i wore sundresses and you know just those real cool dresses almost the entire time yeah yeah and i had one that was born in December so um it was a little bit because however it was a real warm winter so even even into like November and December i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses course i'm always hot when i'm pregnant too so i didn't really need warm clothes uh-huh yeah yeah but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new uh units outfits you know that are just knit oh i haven't tried those oh they're so comfortable it's it's just um you know a light weight kind of like a sweat suit but made out of that real light polyester stuff and huh yeah yeah it's just great because you can put you know you can decorate them up or dress them up if you want or you can just wear them with you know tennis shoes if you want so they're really nice and i've enjoyed wearing those uh-huh but i i don't know if they expected us to talk about blazers and such here but i sure never wear them yeah well i don't either if we if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something that would make a big difference yeah i worked part time when my oldest was a baby uh-huh and um i had to wear a dress every day and i'm watching Janice uh-huh and uh it was a little bit hard to uh wind down i would i would have to drive six thirty five home and i would be burning up like in the summer time by the time i got home i was like oh i got to get out of these clothes oh i i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was married even but uh offices they keep them so cold in the summer that you can't wear regular summer clothes and be comfortable uh-huh uh-huh right right you've got to have something to add to it or something i don't know if you can yeah yeah yeah and then when you drive home like especially if you're in a lot of traffic which you are in Dallas uh-huh because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time i was afraid i'd make the car overheat you burn up yeah yeah it's hard on the car yeah so i would roll my windows down it was still a hundred degrees and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up and oh yeah um i had a friend who used to take shorts to work and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes and i thought that's probably a good idea oh that's funny yeah because you really it at least something cooler yeah because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them if you that's true especially if it's something that has to be dry cleaned which i don't have any of yeah i don't have to worry a whole lot about that no when you have children you don't um even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through that's right something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on too that's right or if you get it dirty or whatever i know it i've always been a creature of comfort too if it's not comfortable forget it me too i know that's how i am too wool was never comfortable to me right me neither i have  do you see anything wrong with public school systems well yes i do um i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job i agree do you do you have children in the public school system yes and i taught for fourteen years is that right before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children you you were a bookkeeper oh everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation oh no well um i'm i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what you know i'd love yes to work with children and to teach them but i'm really having questions if if i can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what i do i don't think me too i don't think it's the teachers i think it's the system but um i think so too they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now right and teacher competency you know and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best she's always worried whose looking over her shoulder and what child's gonna say something some parent's going to overreact to that's that's right i know that's true well it's it's hard on the children too i think you know because the um the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy that's overworked you're not at your best you know um and that's right do you have children in the system i have two i have uh in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them um i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year ah we um live in a district that has open classrooms and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my ninth my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews yes you too and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didn't work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here oh still at it well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasn't working but they didn't have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something just yeah i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area oh goodness oh so i didn't really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here were they that was our last tour up in Michigan well we were from North um Carolina and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education i think they rank about forty ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program oh um-hum and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes oh wow and it was wonderful so you know i'm coming to to Plano thinking well gosh it's going to be really great it's ranked so much better yes yes that's right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system isn't that interesting i i i don't understand how they get this this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money i don't know probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are i guess so well my son is at Clark this year too so uh we're yes so as a freshman yep and uh he's pleased with his classes um i i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough to to know what to expect really you know how to judge it uh yeah my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so well that's good and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect yeah for a freshman to have she's not bogged down but yet she has some every night well Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any so that's interesting but he his grades i haven't seen them yet but supposedly they're good so yes you always hear how good now my son's at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what he's going to bring home so i don't that's right  okay capital punishment all right okay what's your views on it um for myself i'm i'm personally against it but we seem to have a duality of in this country where most states in theory have it but but but do not use it correct okay well i'm for it i think there are certain crimes that definitely uh call for it i i feel like that child molestation and murder i don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that i i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way and of course Texas has it but they very seldom you know put it into effect so instead all of our prisons are full of people on you know okay well a lot of people on death row uh Texas uses it as about as much as any other state well uh yeah which is not very often right Texas is a big state uh here in Maryland to the capital punishment law people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment but no one no one is has actually has the sentence carried out uh i'd certainly what do they do just keep them on death row for the rest of their life um-hum um-hum i think so i there there are a lot there or a fair number uh uh-huh in fact i think that it it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available the sentence of life without possibility of parole uh has become a common one and it's being being used much more do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here uh i don't know the exact numbers but but yes prisons are overcrowded i know that we have you know really in fact they're they're releasing people uh that are in there for you know not major crimes but uh robberies and assault and things like that and because they don't have room which then they're coming back on the streets and of course doing it again and um you know so we're having problems in in that way and i know that there are some cases that uh you know capital punishment does not fit the crime and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types um but i have to say that i'm honestly for it um uh almost that eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth okay you're you're certainly in the majority uh at least in this country yes uh we are i guess the only one of the major Western nations currently with capital punishment i know they use it very um they do not have it in Europe as i understand no at least not in Western Europe probably not in Eastern Europe these days either um there are many reasons for it but they they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates yes you wonder what their you know how they manage to do that well in part it's uh it's the nature of societies perhaps more homogeneous society in many cases uh arguably if arguably is because of of uh of uh welfare state benefits though i tend to be we tend to be skeptical well England has uh don't they have a large uh fairly large welfare yes oh there's no question that that they that uh you know they they've you know all kinds of cradle to grave uh programs welfare programs providing for everyone some way i i i however the question is is that making the difference oh i don't i don't know but we have a lot of welfare programs and if both do and they tend to have less crime you wonder if that has anything to do with it then oh you know or is it uh in our society people are brought up over here thinking that you know everybody owes them something um i think i think that idea is even even more common in Western Europe oh do you um-hum well that's interesting i would not have i would not have said that i would have said that it was more prevalent here in the United States that's an interesting theory i'm not that familiar you know i've only been over there a couple of times and i'm not that familiar with uh me too that all i know is that for instance we were in Germany in uh  oh okay well i am sorry to do this to you um i don't know if you explained this is part of a fund raiser for the church yeah yeah i remember it it's just like what do i know about the metric system yeah well i don't know anything so um you know we can just kind of wing it but if you're ready i'll push one and we can start and lately their bank has been so full that they've been cutting us off after about three to five minutes so it it won't be anything like the okay okay i don't know why the last effort failed i i know that it's very hard to get people to change to do different things i think the metric system is so convenient because it's in multiples of ten um but it's just hard to switch everything over England managed to do it uh right uh i know the whole world has managed to be doing metric system and we're just left out in the middle of nothing and then having to do the conversions that uh the rest of the world doesn't have to do um-hum which makes it more difficult in trading and and that type of thing as far as going back and forth between the two i don't know if they um tried before if there were any way that they could offer incentives to corporations that switched uh i don't even really know where to they would begin i mean certainly um it's already being taught in the schools yeah the schools need to do more widespread um you touch it a little here and there and but you're never explained really explained to it all and and actually even in the science classes though a lot of times um the metric system is used rather than um the American system um-hum well it is a a an universal system now uh that we use um-hum i uh and some ways it's like the idea of the alternative school calendar uh the way our calendar set up goes back to uh the days when we were primarily an agricultural country and people they needed the kids home to help with the farming and planting again the rest of the world it has it has already adopted has always had a uh what we call an alternative calendar with more breaks throughout the year and a shorter summer vacation uh um-hum and and gradually as things try and uh and using that as a parallel i know different districts are trying first with you know one or two schools and then some districts have converted uh maybe there's some areas that they could start a conversion like maybe at the gas pumps that would be one way maybe they need to do it in stages um-hum uh i think the most logical way is just to educate very severely or very uh try very hard in the education system and starting with the young eventually eventually they grow old and they take a while to do it that way but um since it's just right now touched on the education system the more that it's used um and it's impressed upon the children the more comfortable they'll feel with it um i don't feel very comfortable with the metric system even though i was exposed to it um but if they did even so even more than they are now eventually um um-hum it would gain popularity as they grow older and they could switch over more easily the more people they have that's trained on the metric system rather than our system um and actually the metric system itself isn't so difficult it's the conversion that's difficult and um right exactly that's what um i look at it from uh trying to feed families from old recipes and things having i i have friends in England and Germany and when they give me recipes it's hard because they do things in grams and um you know their whole measuring system is different and um-hum um i think that's been an area of resistance but i think your idea of uh starting through the schools and working with the kids um certainly easier growing up with it it's easier to learn something when you are young than to relearn and uh right but much easier so and i always had a hard time converting converting it's like why can't we just all do it the same what's the purpose of switching back and forth why are we different yeah well i don't know why the effort failed before but i have a feeling that it may have been businesses it would be costly for them to convert over um especially some of the manufacturing industries all the machines they have um to have to convert over to centimeters although several things uh already are i know my husband has tools for the car that he has to use  okay um do you have children of your own yeah got uh four oh you do what ages are they yeah uh let's see uh fourteen twelve five and one and a half i was yeah how about you oh my you sound like a busy parent i have two a seven year old and three and a half mine are both girls seven year old okay i've got one boy the oldest one's a boy and the three others are are girls yeah oh do you and your wife both work no huh-uh no she um my wife stays home well that's nice i yeah how about you how about yourself i stay home too yeah to me that's the ideal situation but i did work part-time when i had just one child and uh i'm pretty picky about my criteria of child care i do you huh yeah um-hum yeah i don't care too much for day care centers and preschool well you know schools where the children stay all day long um-hum and so i i think the thing that i would think was most important is is if they're getting that individual attention that they need from an adult and i don't think they get enough of it yeah so what would you what is there a certain ratio that would scare you off or of teachers to kids yeah mine's pretty low too uh the lady that i left my daughter with only kept only had two other children besides my daughter so three to one i felt comfortable with uh-huh uh-huh i think if it got much more than that i would start feeling like someone was gonna be left out so you're talking now now you're pretty well limited to to home care then someone someone taking your your your kid into their home yeah yeah right i don't think well i think once my uh child got to be maybe four years old i might feel a little better about a larger group setting uh-huh but up until that time both of my girls had such passive personalities that if they had been around a whole lot of other children i really think they would have been yeah you know taken for granted some of the other kids would have pushed them around and um probably taken advantage of them a little bit what do you think uh-huh um-hum um i guess i ideally um uh i would if i if my wife had to go to work we'd probably look for a home where the ratio of of uh um adults to children was was you know low and i don't think you won't find that in a in a commercially run day care what was that beep yeah no no oh i didn't even hear one no it might have been i have call waiting but if so i'll just try later that's fine did you you didn't so do i okay um what so what what were we saying that um yeah you said that uh you would like if your wife had to go back to work you probably would prefer that they stayed in a home yeah yeah because how can you um you know did you see the did you see the um i think it was on it was either Twenty Twenty or 60 Minutes about that the day care in Louisiana oh yeah and it looked when the parents visited it looked like um that everything looked fine and they told them one ratio of adults to kids and and and that appeared to be what what the case when they were there but then yeah yeah right then uh it turned out that uh so how do you protect yourself against that i wonder yeah i don't know see i feel real sorry for couples where both people are you know have to work to make ends meet because you're kind of yeah you know stuck there i i know that um if i had to go to work right now i would really have a hard time finding someone because i babysitters are just really hard to come by and especially real good ones and you know ones that uh don't keep that many children and give them the individual attention that i think they need and that kind of thing yeah so i would really be hard pressed to find something that i felt like was quality child care uh-huh so i don't know i feel real sorry for you know working moms that are really looking hard and trying to do a good job with their kids i'm just thankful i'm able to stay home it makes the choice a lot easier yeah well we've been my wife has stayed home uh fourteen years now and it yeah it's not always been easy wow that's great oh i know um to do because there are many times when another salary would be real helpful yeah yeah oh yeah we feel that way i mean even now it's really hard to make ends meet even with two children so i can imagine with four yeah yeah but you learn how to to stretch money how to use hand-me-downs and that kind of thing really makes a big difference too uh-huh but i don't know i uh i worked at a little preschool it was a private one you know like a church sponsored type thing where it was only two days a week Tuesday and Thursday from like nine till two um-hum um-hum and even that i was not totally satisfied with the way the kids were treated uh yeah my wife worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and she's never uh-huh never been uh um satisfied with with uh with what the children were were getting and and and then she worked um not to long ago for just yeah filling in she filled in at a real large commercial commercially run where there were like i don't know how many kids there were but it was twenty kids in a room and i don't know how many adults they had but um um-hum oh yeah so she didn't  okay why don't you go ahead and start okay well we subscribe to People magazine and to Time and course i like the People magazine because it's gossipy um-hum and it's fast reading and uh the Time of course is uh you know more newsworthy and and uh it has more world affair type things of course and then i will purchase a Good Housekeeping occasionally especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and um-hum and things like that and uh do you subscribe to any magazines um-hum yeah i well i have in a while for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because uh i have so much going on in my life that seems to be the last thing i pick up so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them uh when i do subscribe i i've gotten in the past the Parents magazine and uh the Housekeeping magazine and uh uh-huh you probably have smaller children younger children my children are our children are grown yes yeah yeah yeah and uh i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren right well i found that after a couple of years of having a Parents magazine it was getting repetitious so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason uh the Housekeeping magazines i do like because they like you say they have nice uh recipes in them and ideas but uh lately they just been piling up on me so i figured it wasn't uh something i needed at this point in time well do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to i don't know i i well my husband would love to have more now he's the type who will get the uh Inc magazine and Money magazine and all the financial type magazines yes now my husband does that and you know and of course uh naturally Wall Street Journal you know and or Sports Illustrated but i don't know i know i see people leafing through them at the store yeah uh-huh yes um-hum but you just don't hear people talk about them and i know years ago when uh my children were young and stuff i just loved Ladies' Home Journal McCall's Good Housekeeping and i took them all and um um-hum then oh i don't know what in the seventies maybe late seventies they changed their format and i haven't um-hum i don't think there as good a magazine as they used to be even Good Housekeeping i don't well yeah and and some of those that have what what i consider or what i get the idea that they're maybe the the more pricier type magazines as far as women's magazines they seem to be just so chocked full of of ads oh they are my sister uh takes uh Town and Country and Vogue uh-huh and she sends them to me and there's really nothing in them but advertisements for very expensive clothes very expensive jewelry yeah yeah yes things that the average middle class citizen is not going to be purchasing right yeah you know and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living yes yeah you know then i can i look through them and i do i just what i do is i flip through them and and pitch them then you know they're not something i you know take any length of time over yes um-hum um-hum i have discovered that you know with my available time i would rather actually read a book than a magazine yes i enjoy books a lot more that's true yes and um so but well yeah i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to other than my children have gotten you know they get tons of magazines it seems they they're always getting something in the mail yes and uh so between reading to them and uh reading the newspaper and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance but i just don't get a chance for those uh newsy magazines the ones that are full of ads unless you just want to skim through while you're i i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or you know waiting on something like that yes yes i will read them in a doctor's office too as i said i i subscribe to uh to People and to Time and uh yeah and i will go through the Time but usually not to cover to cover you know i'll glance through it i'll like reading uh you know the Passage of People or something you know and uh but i do like the People magazine it it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young um-hum um-hum oh uh-huh and uh that's one and you know i really like that i enjoy that it's quick reading um-hum you know it doesn't require a lot of thinking and sometimes after i've worked all day and have things to do at night yeah i just i want fluff i don't want a lot of thinking um-hum um-hum that's true that kind of is a good way to do it it uh you know it's it's much more relaxing sometimes when i read Time Time magazine after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world so well it seems like we both kind of agree on on the subject of magazines yeah yeah and uh so uh i think that probably i will end the call i've enjoyed okay  okay and uh i i missed a part of it we're to talk about what lawns and gardens lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do i'm i'm a putterer i chose that topic because i really like gardening as far as flowers and shrubs and just keeping a pretty yard uh-huh uh-huh i well it's it's it's very strange strange that i got this call because my wife just called me i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn oh and you know mowing the lawn and removing some old petunias out of the garden this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall fall bulbs um-hum we've had a late fall it seems like the weather in fact today it's really warm and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up but you know you need to pretty soon uh right that's the way this was the the petunias were really great our mums are are beautiful oh uh i don't know if we i don't think we've had a frost up here i've been i was down New Orleans for a week so i don't know what happened last week uh-huh uh but uh it seems like it's oh i don't know if it's late i'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer so i can get a lot of stuff down out here uh-huh um i i enjoy it we came here we just moved into this well we moved in November and put all all the landscaping in this this year we came from nine years in a condo uh and working in that condo you didn't have to do anything you know unless you really wanted to so um-hum so now you have the chance to really create and and spread out right you know i've had this is my third third house i think i've owned um but uh it's interesting the only the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling and it sort of gets away from me if you're not with it so but uh i i enjoy um-hum most of it and about this time of year there is it starts getting a little old and i start looking forward to you know having other things to do with my the grass not growing so fast ah well it is it is for me because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing we had a terrible summer we had a drought oh and uh took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing and now it's really growing and i'm trying to establish a good root root growth you know for the winter hm ours seems to have slowed down here we're not having to mow every week religiously really but we're still fighting bugs and ready to change some of the the summer flowers out i still have caladiums that are pretty which is a surprise this late in the year uh oh really um yeah uh-huh but like today it's eighty five degrees it's really strange oh yeah yeah i hear that from my brother-in-law lives in Plano but that'll change real quick then we'll wished we'd planted bulbs and pansies already yeah well he always he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here and then he calls us yeah it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine so oh my gosh well Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot oh i yeah and we have ice storms every year and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those extremes some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings uh-huh yeah that is i was you know i was like conditioned to it they're they're have to be hardened to it already yeah that's uh that's strange with me um-hum you know you think Dallas you know almost semitropical you wouldn't have that kind of that kind of problem but well for the most part we don't but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold well the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter um-hum but the the ice storms really are stressful on all the the plants that we have around we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to really oh do they and uh pittosporum that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time you you really take a chance with them freezing uh-huh i love yeah i love the uh the landscaping like i say my brother-in-law lives in Plano and i get to Carrollton quite a bit uh-huh i go there on on business and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens and Texas is Dallas Dallas is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing very enjoyable gardens and my wife and i um-hum except for the lack of trees out where we are it was all cotton fields and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful we really miss it well yeah that we have you know Ohio's a a very pretty state we moved in seventy six we moved to Chicago we lived there for five years um-hum and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt uh we were coming in and before the plane landed she looked out the window and she said she said Randy there's no trees down there i said there are this is Illinois you know and when we got out to the area where we decided decided we were going to live and buy a house there were no trees because the farmers had cleared all the land hm um-hum and now all of a sudden it was being developed and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees  sure i have a Springer Spaniel and her name is Thumper she's about seven or eight years old okay do you have any hm i got her for Christmas from my family and uh back when we lived in Nebraska i like to hunt and uh so i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like Thumper that boy i could just go out and get all kinds of game yeah except we live in Plano Texas now so did it work no right i um i had a for many years i had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel i just love them her name was Molly but she isn't alive anymore we had her for hm fifteen years i think my family did and just loved her she was the greatest greatest um went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle do you have a pet now yeah i have a cat now he just turned seven also and he's i um got him in Arizona and when i used to live there and he is huge he is eighteen pounds oh what kind of cat is it just um i got him he was um he was born in the wild like in a in a shed uh-huh and had never been in a building when i got him so he and he's he he must be part cross part with some kind of desert animal because he's very long and lanky but he's a very tame spoiled house cat you know now that i've had him for seven years being born outside you didn't have any problems house training them no no he's yeah he's great and uh he's uh he's really spoiled though so but he's that's good really big so lots of times he it he seems to get in fights and when he was younger i think he started them and now i think he barely makes it i think he gets beat up even though he's big because he's sure pretty much overweight and comes home with a few scratches now and then yeah and older well we went to a uh cat show at the Plano Center here in town and uh we thought that we have a cat now but we thought well if we ever get another cat you know we'd want something kind of unique so we kind of looked around and they had everything from hairless cats to Siamese cats and Persian cats and we sort of fell in love with the uh Maine Coon cats oh i've seen them i they're huge yeah i have seen them they um weren't they they were actually i can't remember they were used to be used on ships and in for for mousers you know so they're very nautical too oh i'll be darned i didn't know that yeah i just uh i think i'm i think i'm being accurate in the in the area of folklore but i'm not sure well that's interesting we kind of like well my family didn't necessarily like like them as much as i did but the Manx is that the one that doesn't have a tail it sort of has a bob tail i kind of like that too but yeah yeah yeah i'd love to go to a cat show i'm real like a real cat lover i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let us let me he doesn't really like mine let alone another one so well i'll tell you an interesting story about how i got my dog and then i suppose our five minutes will be up huh i uh yeah okay work for a university and i went to uh Omaha Nebraska to recruit students and i had some time off in the afternoon so i went to a a pet shop and i saw these little Springer Spaniels and so i decided well you know this would really be a nice dog to have so when i got back home to Carney Nebraska hm i told my wife about it and i said you know this is just a i i i can just hear the dog crying for me now and and Christmas is coming up hint hint and so i know what you mean i had to go back the next week as well as a bunch of other people from the university and one of the people uh that we went with uh they were friends of ours and so we uh got to Omaha and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog and so i got over there and she said oh that's too bad the dog has already been sold and i didn't realize it but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier bought the dog and she was in the back room and uh so that night we had a reception for some of the uh potential high school students or college students and and uh he had the dog the whole time in his room and and i had no idea and so we headed back to Carney that night and the dog rode in the car and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat and they left the dog in the car and i guess while we were inside eating Thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car and uh finally we made it back to uh to Carney and  hi i'm wondering what what camping means to you hi when i think of camping i think of of bugs and sleeping bags and and tents uh like along the Appalachian Trail oh very good that's sort of the same thing that that i do i don't think of um trailers and campers and all this stuff no um do you do much camping i have never been camping oh you've never been camping oh gee no do you do much well um yes and no and the uh i haven't done much recently but um up until gee maybe five or six years ago i did a lot of it and you know i've sorry really uh where you live now or uh did you camp up in Maryland or no um i used to live abroad and so i i camped a lot in um the Middle East and i was able to camp right in ruins which was always very exciting oh okay oh i bet and a bit exotic for those who love bugs but um and then when i used to come back to the states in summer we'd often go up um to the lake country in New York with my brother's family and and do camping there uh-huh oh okay well my cousin uh husband and and his uncle especially uh grew up camping together and uh they they just love it and they're planning a trip uh into Canada this i guess in about a year and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there and you're not going no this is this is a a man's trip so oh that's too bad so they're really looking forward to that oh gee so i guess it makes a difference i grew up camping being in Girl Scouts and things like that so and see i was i was never exposed to it uh-huh uh-huh so it's i i feel like i'm a little bit too uh much of a city city mouse to try doing it oh that's too bad i think the you know there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like but maybe not the you you know the Canada men's trip but some other you know a nice tent on the the shore of a lake and what's the best part about it to to you the the quiet the getting away right the and the the no telephone the gee whiz you go to bed when it gets dark and you get up when it gets light man yeah and um i guess just just the change from the rat race now do you usually like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around or is it pretty much much isolated no it's uh it's pretty isolated um and to me i like that i guess too although there are people i mean you know it's really hard to get away yeah and i guess when when we did sites in in the Middle East of course it was with a group in order to make it safe yes but i mean we'd go in different parts of the ruins and and things like that but we didn't even have tents there we just sort of put out the sleeping roll oh good grief that that does sound neat but i don't think i i've got a quite enough nerve to do that i know my husband's gone uh for several days on the Appalachian Trail before and he said that you can a lot of times you can go for you know a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail right so it's not for the faint of heart i don't think right actually i just joined um the Appalachian Trail Walking Club or whatever they call it what uh and i'm very eager to to start uh i love to walk oh uh-huh and um i'm going to start with day trips though because i don't know the territory and all and i'm not sure um my son is not eager to go and you know i think that that that might be a little eerie at first going alone i think it would be yeah well that sounds really neat oh but you know i'm gonna try well gee whiz i hope you get into camping some day just slowly well i don't know uh we talk about sometimes going up to Chincoteague oh yeah and uh i maybe like you said start out slow and and kind of get used to it and find out that it maybe it's not as bad as i i fear it might be right i think that you know i guess one time recently we went up to Maine and had planned to camp and you know the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field and i said gee whiz for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a a motel which we did and so that you know if the setting was right and that it's it's great but if it's just yeah  okay where do you enjoy dining out oh i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap yes do you have children uh we have four but most of them are gone now so there there might be but we were taking you know uh four five and six people out ah yes that makes a difference doesn't it uh-huh what area of the country do you live in yes i'm in Texas yes i am too and we lived we lived in Ohio prior to this oh so i did too i'm from the Dayton area uh we were up near Cleveland yeah ah but i look for service even at the quickie places type things uh i don't like to go to the drive-thrus because sometimes they get your order wrong and then you're stuck and it's a pain to have to uh-huh that's right stand there and see what it is before you leave so i really don't like the drive-thrus that much i i like to go and eat there yes but i would say service uh atmosphere and whether the food is good on on going out i like steaks so we try to hit those places when we can when we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals and then that way they can get their burgers and fries and we can have a salad bar um-hum yeah so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's because it's all either McDonald's or Dairy Queens but uh yeah and in in in the countries unless it's a large city i guess Dairy Queen and Wal-Mart are their main that's what you find right right that's right i know my husband likes um Dairy Queens he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese dogs i guess so he's a fan of of Dairy Queen and and we'll go even in town here at times just as a a change although uh-huh uh-huh i'm not that excited about it it we've eaten we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place but yet i hate to cook food at home oh so that might be why i look for inexpensive places just because we're eating out probably five uh-huh nights a week maybe or we eat junk food at home um yeah uh now that my husband so what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places oh we'll go to them all we sort of take turns and and we uh i'm sort of favor the ones if i have a coupon we can go there and if not we can't because it's cheaper so mine is monetarily i guess strongly monetarily uh-huh based uh we'll go get pizza and uh at Little Caesar's although the kids prefer Domino's oh we are Little Caesar fans here that's where we always go right but it's just a lot cheaper than than Domino's so that's we go to Grandy's quite a bit i would say yes we like Grandy's too McDonald's uh we've sort of been off of that for a while and no particular reason and i i maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there and she never wanted us show up there oh so i don't uh we don't go there that much where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out or a big meal a nice meal oh where you go for steaks it's usually when we're out of town and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined ah uh-huh so that it's really not in town ah you ever been to Houston's on Beltline no that's where we go to get steaks they have a teriyaki steak there and when we have something to celebrate we head to Houston's they don't take reservations and you wind up waiting about an hour um-hum um-hum but the food is good and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink unless you get there at five o'clock then you can go right through right but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks so that's our nice place to go we don't usually take the kids when we go there don't well we don't go out that much i guess well i guess we do go out without kids we're usually picking things up quickly though and just we just don't yes dwell on food too much and uh with my husband traveling he can get all he needs for that during the week going to those places so it it doesn't really matter to him he'd probably just like to stay home right that's right yeah that's the way with my husband he's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends and i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere right so we have a conflict of interests on the weekends well i think our i i never have liked to cook food but i think it all began eating out when we had uh the boys in in different uh baseball on baseball team it was mainly baseball teams and my husband would coach right yes so we were never home at the same time and i'm not one that's going to fix you know the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever they're there if they're not there in between five and six well then i guess we don't eat today or you go you know you fend for yourself you go somewhere else uh-huh right yep so that you know that really snowballed when we got down here when i started to sub make money i went oh well i'll just sub to  okay for as far as um i would think the probably the uh worst substance that's probably um or started to say the uh what causes the most air pollution is probably the car probably so and uh whether or not um they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed uh train or or something like that or park yeah it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility yeah that's exactly it and that's what we're finding um here where we're at in Minneapolis area is that people don't want to carpool that there are um-hum inconveniences to that or maybe you don't like the person you have to you would want to carpool with that kind of thing so it's it's kind of a thing where uh i think the majority of the people do not carpool i think so too i'm in Texas and very few people carpool uh the people that i know don't want to because uh um-hum yeah they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon you know they just feel they need their car exactly uh-huh or if somebody gets sick yeah or if somebody gets sick and it's not the other person and they want to go home and that one person's got the car then they're they're stuck you're definitely right so um-hum um-hum that's right and people don't want to give it up but now i think we've made great strides in changing a lot of that by going to the unleaded gasoline and and yes um-hum sure oops sure that happens quite a bit to change the car itself but uh you know i i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent but yeah yes yeah that's very true um other than that uh i don't know oh okay oh okay we'll try to be real quick here the other thing then is because i don't know how long they want us to talk it well my other line is ringing but we're going to ignore it i'm sorry for these beeps oh a close to five minutes i believe and you're in Minneapolis well is the pollution really bad up there five minutes oh okay Minneapolis area uh actually no we have uh quite a bit uh the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone and of course hay fever season you get more pollutants such as those but those are natural um-hum um-hum yeah um but there is starting to in Minneapolis itself because of so many people on the highway there is becoming a problem of pollution and they just put in a strict um-hum law that as of every year when you get your license tabs you have to have your car inspected to see if it's releasing any uh lead um-hum um-hum into the air the air or other pollutants and if that's the case then you have to get your car fixed at least you can't um-hum that's the way it has gotten here we have just had that law i think about a year maybe a year and a half here in Texas sure yeah but uh i think it's a good idea because a lot of people still want to drive the older cars which you can't blame them for that and uh but if they are polluting the air they need do need to have them fixed yeah it's not a bad idea um-hum sure sure exactly and you know there's a big move especially in the industrial part in Texas right now of controlling the CFCs that the big manufacturing companies are producing into the air they're having to change the type of products they use um-hum sure uh-huh uh they can't use like i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business uh-huh and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of Freon that they use in the air conditioning systems systems sure therefore the individual every time they have a service call if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty two Freon or whatever it is it costs them three times as much to get it fixed uh-huh sure and uh if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of Freons that do not release as many CFCs into the atmosphere it doesn't cost as much uh-huh yeah so eventually people are gonna have to go to newer systems you know but sure uh the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars uh air conditioning i'm sure over there it's it's a necessity versus something up here we can live without it but it's uncomfortable um-hum right um-hum but uh this year my husband recharged our freon because it was needed to be done and one of the cans released entire amount of freon into the uh um-hum hm into the air because he opened it and i don't know if there was something wrong with it or it his directions weren't quite fully instructed onto that and i was thinking how many other people um-hum it's probably happened to millions of people um-hum oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price um-hum because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say hey that's that's right there i think it's like three or four dollars a a can um-hum yeah and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car and i i thought about that and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it inhaled so much of it um-hum but uh you think about that all the people that are using freon and things like that and yeah well of course in the uh i'd think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places in the hair sprays we're not seeing as many aerosol cans down here nearly everything is in the pump squirt you uh-huh exactly pump yeah  well i did hear the end of the prompt this time was that you that we didn't hear the whole prompt and it said that what what do we do we think that crime certain crimes should fit certain punishments yes yes and uh i was thinking about it after i got off the phone that that i really you know wish that there was some way to uh send a message to people you know about um child abuse and things like that that uh those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment too often i feel that people get off uh um-hum without yeah i i agree with you although i will say i'm not sure you know i sometimes have a problem with some of the especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have you know was was because they were abused abused abused as children and the parents are saying hey wait a minute we didn't do anything like that you know and um-hum and and i guess before i'd like to see that severe of a punishment for it it has to be a an absolute certainty um-hum you know like uh caught at it or something you know or if they they uh you know severely beat up on a child or you know i would have absolutely no problem at all right right yeah you know with with i don't buy the routine oh they're just sick or they were abused when they were little well well you know forget that um-hum yeah well sometimes they even wonder when when uh criminals plead temporary insanity for for punishment for crimes that are so severe and then you know they get sent to a mental institution and they play loony for a while and then they're back out in public um-hum well but i can't see that either i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any deterrent again uh you know reason to not use capital punishment yeah yeah oh i agree i agree because we i think uh i think if i wanted to badly enough i could convince somebody uh i was crazy so my family may say that on occasion who knows you know uh i i don't think it's that hard to do um-hum you know to to convince somebody that uh gee you just had no control over what you were doing yeah yeah well and too you know they can always be blaming the other person well she looked like my mother who abused me when i was a child or something which i think is um-hum unfortunate for that person and yet shouldn't be an excuse i guess you know a lot of and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some Miss America was abused by the man she loved and um-hum that's the new one is that the new i just happened to see the headline on it and i didn't couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what but i thought uh you know if these things if children are being abused i i'm wondering how our school system is failing that they're not even seeing this you know if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger and that kind of that kind of worries me with my kids only being under two and not having you know to to deal with that yet but still well you you're right uh and yet i mean did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this no never and i lived in California which i feel like California you know anything can go on in California oh well yes well yes i but i was from conservative Wisconsin and uh you know there was there was nothing on it which makes me wonder you know if it's as uh prevalent as as some of them claim yeah it uh it it it's you just don't know and it all unless they're caught in the act or the the the child is very badly you know beaten up it comes down to a one word against the other um-hum um-hum you know that type thing now Texas is capital punishment for it used to be just capital murder and now they they added mass murder are those the only two things that we uh i really would have no idea i uh i don't don't really know uh you know because i have a feeling it is and i i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you um-hum that would be pretty lenient in my opinion yeah i i think that's i you know uh killing a child uh kidnapping uh and possibly not well i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt you know if they release them two hours later he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty yeah that's that or like when uh i've heard when i  what do you like to watch on television Maureen well i guess a lot of the uh something that's kind of more of a comedy we do have uh cable and we have premium stations like HBO and Showtime and such and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the TV on i i normally go to those because i pay for them i'm like i guess i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there so i don't end up watching the um yes prime time on some of the standard channels as much i i tend to go to my premium channels first uh-huh uh-huh well we have cable but we only have Cinemax and uh i think our favorite night is uh Monday night and we start out with Evening Shade um-hum um-hum and Major Dad and i think that's the one night that we really try to watch television you know my husband's always got it on i'm not always sitting down at it um-hum yeah Monday night's pretty good with Murphy Brown and Designing Women yes yes yes i just i love that all those that that two hours and uh now tonight i just finished up with that A Woman Called Jackie did you watch did you watch it um-hum uh-huh we had watched it uh i guess Sunday night and Monday night but we didn't get to watch it tonight yeah it was it was pretty good it uh sometimes i like a dramatization and i like uh USA when they have their uh uh mystery movies and things their made for TV movies um-hum um-hum and uh i like those and we very seldom watch any uh Public Television channel thirteen do you watch it much the only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights starting fairly late like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe till midnight they have some British comedy yes that we've we've really liked a there's a variety some of them is uh Black Adder or Good Neighbors or Yes Prime Minister and Are You Being Served they they rotate those around and um we like that British comedy British comedy is very fast you really have to listen but yes it is now we haven't watched any of those they're real good but they do come on kind of late but we really do enjoy those sometimes we get to watching some stuff on Discovery Channel yes now we have watched some things on that and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there but i'm very intrigued i one time i was watching a operation and i thought gee i i don't believe i'm watching this yeah we had uh i don't know my husband loves to uh that male syndrome of flicking that channel thing you know and he's flipping around there and and he went by and he said whoops and he backed up and you know there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner you know and and i'm saying let's move right on yeah yeah right right but our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if they're over here because lots of times they will have things on uh animals and they just thoroughly um-hum um-hum you know enjoy that in fact i think they were watching something on uh um-hum whales or killer sharks sharks one or the other couple of weeks ago over here and uh so we have watched that and uh otherwise of course my husband's into the football um-hum um-hum um-hum oh and you know i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else you know with him and uh but other right yeah i'm not into watching sports now my husband likes to watch football he's not really into uh baseball or basketball too much but uh football soon as it's fall then he likes to watch college on Saturday and then of course Cowboys on Sunday yes yes and sometimes now we're getting it that uh the other football where they play it inside and you know i'm hollering this is a you know this is too much Saturdays and Sundays this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring you know all of that and uh but he will uh he'll flip around i think the other night we had on uh yeah um uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i don't know what channel he found that on hm and uh but he will turn that on especially for if again if our uh oldest grandson is over here he's ten and uh they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know um-hum i keep telling him it's the same mentality there you know something's wrong and uh but uh and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night because we're not home oh and uh so and Sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on Sunday so you know we don't get into that except that sometimes we'll get into the home videos um do you ever watch that yeah the you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff yeah those are pretty good yeah yeah um-hum that are sometimes so dumb but true to life i mean some of the those but very true to life i mean i've seen our family in several of those situations  okay um where do you work i work at NCNB i'm a lawyer oh okay so um so you probably wear the suits every day i wear a suit yeah i was i bet um i work at JC Penney finance oh okay and i wear suits um sometimes you know the dress a nice dress or a nice pant outfit oh you can wear pants yes as long as we have the nylons and that and heels on wow so that's kind of nice i've worn them in the winter when it's like ten degrees and you know no one's going to look uh-huh well that's see i just moved here from South Dakota oh and now that's a change in wearing clothing oh yeah but uh they just got uh they're down to thirty degrees now already yeah and they've gotten snow and the whole bit so when i was there i would wear everything you know i didn't own a winter coat to wear to work until um two years ago oh really i mean my whole i what do i graduated college in eighty three uh-huh and i have not bought one until two years ago oh really because you just don't need it huh-uh you know when i i moved here and it's it's just great i call back there and it's just you know it's wonderful to be able to wear no coat you know and just a dress and and go to work when did you get here June first oh so you got the summer yeah and it wasn't too bad um because there they can have both extremes so we can yeah i guess they that uh it can get really hot it it did not get hot here this summer that's what i was told that it was pretty mild but that's when i moved and i left all my winter clothes with my mom in Nebraska don't don't send for them okay i i just brought a couple and it's like they're still sitting in the closet a couple yeah i oh i have six of them and all the essentials essentials you have more more than one oh God um but yeah all you know we just have to wear the nice clothes and the and which i was really surprised that i wouldn't have to be in the suit no we have a lot of the women in our office even are believe it or not uh banks are not that bad and we don't meet with customers you know we work for the uh-huh for the um oh you know we work with the banking officers um-hum so we don't have people come in and look at us and we wear fun stuff too like um oh shorter skirts and uh-huh uh you know a lot of dresses yeah i i'd say it's it's uh probably eighty percent dresses um-hum and uh once in a while we wear the pants but not too often i just wear i just wear an old suit when i don't feel like you know i feel like i don't have any imagination today i'll get this starched shirt out and put a suit on yeah yeah i know this matches i'm not going to have to think about this yes but uh it's the truth oh yeah well you'll get but i just started the job a few months ago they just opened up um the new office that i'm working at and since we are located you know they located it in Dallas are you in Plano yeah i live in Plano but they have it down on Hillcrest and uh LBJ ooh that's up on Hillcrest and LBJ oh the uh okay yeah but yeah that's um well i'm i'm more used to downtown okay so um i i never lived North of yeah i haven't i haven't gone into downtown too much well you don't need to yeah believe me you don't need to yeah i just lots of street people yeah my brother works down there in the building where the Kennedy uh book or the library is the School Book Depository yes and uh he it's tough yeah there are lots of bums on the street and uh if you go i went to work this morning early and i had to i parked in a fourteen dollar parking garage oh you're kidding well uh you know i i mean i got there at four o'clock in the morning and oh wow and uh i'm not going to walk you you know walk anywhere downtown at that time of the day uh-huh hum and so you park park where you can go directly in on the tunnel into the building wow yeah i haven't you know i i just haven't gone down there so you know it's pretty you it's like where i'm from here you know in South Dakota it wasn't a real population population like Dallas has as many people as we did in our whole state um-hum so it's uh a little different but i really like it here so i'm glad i'm a native so i always like to hear that yeah yeah i really enjoy it i you know we we both graduated my husband and i both graduated from college and decided to move here just like decided to move here um-hum golly he'd like to get his Master's at UTD oh okay and he liked that school so we come here for him to start that and and he has a Spanish you know degree so for him to use that we had to get somewhere where that was useful yeah except down here it's a dime a day well yeah not really if he's if he's Anglo yeah an Anglo who speaks Spanish  okay i'll just go with you first what kind of eating out do you enjoy okay well i like dining out of course it means that i don't have to cook but um i'm a divorced woman i have one child and you know when when we dine out right um-hum we go to like medium priced restaurants i don't i don't particularly i think it's sort of a waste of money to go real to a real high priced restaurant um-hum do you go like home cooking like Black-Eyed Pea and that kind of thing or cafeteria um yeah um not really we go more for the um Chinese and Italian and stuff like that Mexican stuff that i can't cook yeah me too uh-huh Mexican uh-huh uh we do too we do the same what are your favorite places um well i like Chinese food um uh there's a little place down on what is that Coit Road um um-hum Chinese Pavilion or something that is really good and i like it and um i do i do like Chinese buffets uh-huh oh yeah well we go we've gone to August Moon and we think that was real good but our favorite when you have a little more to spend is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon uh-huh uh-huh and those are excellent they're really a nice place you could take someone to eat it's not the the rinky-dink Chinese decorations but it's a very elegant nice place to eat we go right uh-huh uh-huh very very often we go out for fajitas that's my husband's just gotten stuck and we go to On the Border oh uh-huh and lots of places that have uh i think Costa Rosa and some of those and get fajitas and he'll just eat chips till we've got three or four baskets coming back uh-huh and then uh last weekend we went out for Italian also and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to wanna go eat lasagna and garlic bread so we went to El Sorrento right uh-huh uh-huh have yeah have you ever um tried Pappasito's and it was fun you know what this is that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church and Bob pointed to it and he said i keep hearing good things about that place we're gonna have to go oh it is delicious that's what he said that in fact you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that um-hum so i guess we'll have to do it he it's you always stand in line when you go but it's worth the wait that's what that's what it D Magazine said that it said there was always a line but that's probably i mean that's a good that's a good sign um-hum uh-huh and have you ever tried um the Macaroni Grill up on yes we did now my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti uh-huh or lasagna and most of those things were a little more northern Italy right and they like just the traditional they're not very that they're they're the Spaghetti Warehouse type right yeah yeah my little girl likes uh Spaghetti Warehouse real well it's real entertaining for her yes they are exactly exactly the place of the seventies um-hum yeah most kids do what do you ever go for steak just a steak and potato and salad bar that kind of thing um not really that's a steak something that i cook at home um-hum you know that that you grill out and i really don't particularly um yeah well i'm i'm real curious to try this one that has such horrid commercials the uh that Del Lincoln and oh what is that guy's name they do those real corny commercials hm it's um over there's one over there in Addison i can't remember his name anyhow it's some steak yeah it's some famous steak place over in Addison there's a there's a second one downtown and they have these really corny radio commercials but their steak their steak is supposed to be wonderful so i had i had not tried that my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie uh-huh um-hum and it seems like i've been we we found those one time and then they discontinued it was over in Addison and then they um closed up so most of these places are pretty much just uh theme restaurants around here hm yes right i think that's what goes you know really goes right now in the in the Dallas area of course you know down um-hum next to downtown up around McKinney and everything you know there's just a there's a different class uh-huh well that's exactly true that's right of restaurants up there that i can't even touch that's right yeah that's right you know it'd probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and have one meal up there but um that's even yeah that's right uh-huh i had a friend who was taken to Lawry's downtown for prime rib and i haven't been we usually don't go for beef really anymore we're we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's that's usually the way we'll go if we're not going lasagna uh-huh uh-huh right um-hum um-hum yeah when when i go out it's it's normally to get um some specialty type of food besides you know because you chicken and steaks and everything i grill at home um-hum um-hum i know well i understand and and really it's they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant that's right saves you a little bit money that's right and save you some money too well now what your what's your child's favorite place to eat um favorite place uh she has a lot Taco Bell yeah that's right oh yeah they're easy yeah well that's right mine enjoy that too they like to go pretty much where we like to go and they'll and then our favorite thing on Fridays we generally order pizza in so not Pizza Inn but pizza to our house um-hum right right uh-huh so we've done that well um is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it i think we've i think it's come to a nice conclusion so i'll talk with you later thank you bye-bye no not that i know of uh-huh thank you bye-bye  do you have children uh yes uh we have two sons uh one's a freshman in college and one's a sophomore in high school and you ah i have one that's a freshman in high school a daughter and a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school okay and i spend most of my time carpooling the story of my life oh yes yes uh my kids are involved in sports my daughters played basketball for six years and my son plays football i my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year yeah because there's just not enough of me to drive them around everywhere uh well uh yeah we spend a lot spend a did spend a lot of time uh it really helped when the uh older one was old enough to get his license and could uh yes drive around by himself although that brought in a whole another set of problems but uh for yeah for one thing uh i know i know the insurance but yeah we uh we do but our two had had uh totally different interests so that there there was not much uh overlap as such the the older one is not was not at all into uh sports for the most part uh he participated band and and uh scouts were his two big things and uh yes my son is in both band and scouts too and the younger younger one is uh uh the sports one and the whatever season it is he's he's playing although football's really his favorite yeah oh gee so uh yeah we spend a lot of time uh uh carpooling and uh you know and then trying to be uh at as much as possible with anything that they that they do but then uh right we also did do spend uh time with them trying to trying to uh you know just family time uh uh-huh we at a at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth and and uh uh although we didn't uh do it as much or as often as uh i would have liked to i would like to do that as a as a family and and some TV watching what about you yeah we found this Oriental tile game called mah-jongg yeah i've i've i've heard of that i've never actually never actually played it but have you well it's really fun um one of my neighbors moved here from Memphis and a lot of them played it and she started a group going in the neighborhood and my kids wanted to learn how to play it and it's more fun with four people yeah yep and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play and they both enjoy it so if they want to play they have to play with mom and dad so uh we play that a lot with them yeah and uh we like to go miniature golfing and to movies we have family that lives outside of the state so we yeah go visit both sets of grandparents and and take car trips so that and my husband and son go camping yeah so do we okay with scouts mostly my daughter and and i hate camping so we go shopping so that just kind of works out real well and um i'm a writer yeah yeah by profession and my daughter enjoys writing too so a lot of times she and i will travel to writers conferences together oh now that's neat yeah no we never had anything like like that but that yes yeah so that gives us special time together too and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that so i can help her with that and she gives me ideas for my writing too so yeah um-hum yep um-hum oh well good well i you know in terms of in terms of any sorts of trends i you know obviously obviously things are different from for for me than and my children than when i was growing up i i i grew up on a farm uh in Iowa and uh yes you know the whole family was around the the whole time and and what my father did was was uh interseting you know obvious to me and i i helped out with it but uh although i have brought my boys into to see where i work it's not that easy and it's it's certainly not at all common and they they just don't really have that same idea so that there's uh it's it's a whole different uh kind of thing there then then uh right my husband's taken us to work with him and we still don't know what he does so we just say he travels a lot so that kind of covers it yeah yeah yeah well that makes it hard though for in terms of you know family time with with him yes yeah yeah i've been lucky in that respect that i don't uh don't travel too much he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months oh yes so those are the real killers if he's just gone he's gone three weeks right now and that's that's mild compared to the big ones so we just you know yeah yes yeah i just do the carpooling and and handle whatever needs to be done and something major always needs to be done so yeah yeah yeah you just have to to handle it till he gets home and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home yeah right  doing good how are you doing okay well doing great i had a while to think about it so why don't i start and you can chip in when you feel like it go right ahead uh when we were first married we didn't think we needed a budget and and i think it was fine with the two of us we just kind of spent as we wanted and seemed like we got paid off enough that it would cover now now how long ago was it that you got married oh it's been about nine years so nine years okay then when we actually got out of school and employed and we only started getting paid once a month and we found that you really had to budget things or by the last week or two you were broke so that's probably when we started budgeting and ever since we just you know what type of budget do you have oh i don't know no i mean i mean how do how do you keep do you actually look to see what you have spent each month or do you plan on what you're gonna spend for the month or i mean how do you do your budget i probably plan what we're going to spend each month i mean we get paid and i deduct all that we're going to have you know all the bills at first and then i set aside so much for utilities that we need and so much for this and okay then we have a certain amount each week to work with for groceries and and lots of times i go over that amount but well see now for myself i'm a CPA so needless to say my budget is probably extremely well fine tuned uh i've been married now for nineteen years um-hum uh-huh and every month since the the day that i was married i have had a budget i take all the checks that i write and all the deposits that i make and i put into my computer and it spits out a beautiful financial statement and from the financial statement i can see each month exactly what i have spent to see what i have made and see if there's any profit in leftovers so i can tell if on a month by month basis if i'm spending too much and if i am i just simply go to the wife and say okay time to cut it off you know this is how much you spend on this you'd better not do it anymore well it's it's it's you know our budget's so much and you can just you can look at it and you can see hey that on clothing we have spent on this particular month so much more than the average i mean was just way out of proportion right and that's usually about schooltime for us it always seems to be Christmas time and yeah Christmas and summer uh so i have these financial statement and i look at them month by month by month oh yeah yeah and i can tell you to the penny how much we have spent in groceries how much we spend in utilities how much we spend on entertainment vacations that's great car car expenses whatnot and we know what we should be spending and uh now for my wife she's a schoolteacher her income is fixed for for myself i own my own CPA practice um-hum right so we have a uh uh a floating you know my income is not fixed it can go up it can go down but you've got the generalities you know what it's about it's going to be right yeah and so what we look at is is to see behind us because now i do not plan in advance i can not tell you what we're gonna be spending money on in the month of November i don't i don't know but i can tell you what we did spend in September um-hum and as i see that i can then say okay here we are in October uh so then you know we're we're a little bit short this you know last month we we spent way too much so we need to hold back let's not spend anything this month or next month so that's how i do my budget um yeah yeah that's great i i break mine down quite a bit i keep what's called a nonbalanced checkbook but i put all like fifty dollars away for clothes for the month or fifty dollars for savings bonds and you know and then when i feel like it i deduct that or so it's kind of a different way to do it but uh there was a time when i remember i always wanted to put fifty dollars into my savings account but now it just a matter i want to pay fifty dollars off of my bills that i have you know but uh i i i will not allow myself to have a credit card yeah we do and that that i now i i do have a credit card but i don't ever pay or have a balance of more than i can uh payoff uh-huh no we don't either we never we use it to float mainly yes i use it to float extremely especially on big purchases or around Christmas and yes i i enjoy that forty five day float very very much but uh i i have not paid an interest a penny of interest in the last ten years yes yeah we i bet we haven't for two or three years or you know once in a while you you have something come up that is more than you can handle or or you thought you could handle and you have to leave a little balance but we haven't for ages either curiosity only only because i'm a CPA uh how do you budget for the April fifteenth or do y'all always have a refund or so far we've always had refunds we you know have we have three children and that seems to really help and we probably don't make enough right now so and i i assume do you own a house but yes good i think if we did see that we were starting  okay changes what how how old are you i am twenty twenty oh boy i'm thirty three i feel a lot older uh what do you think the changes are yeah how old are you oh um hm um i just think it's more acceptable for women to um be in the workplace than uh i guess it was a long time ago um that's acceptable as in um like i just think that they were expected to be at home more before yeah and now it's more prevalent i guess i work for a really big corporation and we are uh NCNB oh really yeah and we've got a lot of women in the in the company and i'm a lawyer too so it's like this you know i i've got a i perspective working for a big corporation and a professional working for a big corporation um uh-huh and uh i i you know there are a lot of women here there are a lot of women in power positions but uh and and that's just all wonderful and hunky-dory and aren't we progressive business but there are very very few women in uh in senior positions right on on not you know not on the board of directors uh you know not in senior level management and i don't know if that's from um i don't know that's uh just because there hasn't been time or whether there's a glass you know what they call a glass ceiling um-hum so you just don't think that it's as do you think that's good or bad or i i think it's i think what you're saying is true and that it's acceptable and okay women get out and work but i don't know that um they're they're really expected they're really then um in i hate to use the word again accepted in the position of being workers um-hum you know yeah y'all get out there and do that but you know we're not gonna you know we're not gonna make a chairman of the board right and why do you think that why why do you think that is just just just because i don't see it i also i work with a lot of law firms and a lot of companies and you know most of the most of the uh movers and shakers are men um-hum and then in the bank even most of the you know there are a few women that really stand out but you know most of the young eager ones you know the oh the young wonder children are men do you think it's because they have the qualifications or because not at all no no uh well i don't know i think maybe some of it's because uh uh oh i don't no and i'm i'm not certain i don't know hm seems like some of the women they maybe the women aren't motivated uh but they just are willing to take the backseat or right i'm gonna go in and be a clerk and no you're just as smart as the fellow you're working for um-hum that's what i see a lot of i wrote my senior research paper on the Equal Rights Amendment so i'm kind of an activist yes yeah oh really are you really so you're pretty um liberal as far as i'm very liberal and i speaking to someone in Provo Utah well um yeah i i don't know i'm more of a i guess i'm more conservative in my viewpoints i mean i think it's great if they want it if you know women wanna do that and i'm planning on being a nurse so but i don't know i how many men are there in in in you know the nursing profession very few very few yeah but and and why is that because they think it's a woman's job probably yeah i know but uh or maybe men wanna earn more money i i don't i did exactly want wanna earn more money so they can support family i don't well hum and uh you know i my sister-in-law's a nurse i know what she does and it's she has a lot of responsibility i mean she just doesn't change bedpans and uh right the you just don't think that it pays off i mean like i i found out like the all the doctor comes comes in and does is the like end delivery is come in and deliver deliver the baby i mean all the pre-everything is nurse nurses but the doctors get the bucks yeah exactly they get the bucks and they get the and the recognition for it and all the patient sees is this woman you know hovering around yeah and you know yanking on wires and and IV cords and yeah um-hum so i i and i don't think that i don't think that nurses get half the recognition they ought to for example oh definitely i i agree  Mark where where do you live uh i live in Richardson oh do you okay i'm in Plano okay okay uh what kind of music do you like um uh rock and roll rock and roll yeah me too that's pretty much yeah what i listen to i'm i'm twenty one so i'm in the the new kind of rock and roll stuff oh you're twenty one okay i'm twenty three yes okay so not much difference yeah i was a music minor in college oh so um i i took a uh recording engineering class out in Irving with a guy named Phil York uh-huh so i know how to run a sound room and everything like that well that's neat yeah that's neat have you ever recorded anything or oh i did a band project for the class itself and then i haven't been able to get anything with it since uh-huh i have some friends with bands and they don't even bother to ask me oh really yeah oh that's when you find out who your friends are i guess yeah you do oh that would that is neat i like that i've always wanted to be in a band but yeah we just moved here in June and i haven't been able to get settled that much yet but yeah i i i played piano for about sixteen years so yeah my i uh i think i took for about four years when i was younger and i don't remember how old i was really did you like it yeah yeah i had fun with it as as long as it wasn't too dull and boring like Mary had a Little Lamb yeah the simpler stuff was a little more boring but yeah i had i taught for a while and and the kids just they just didn't you know after they got to a certain point they gave up yeah you know and and they tell you if you can't keep it interesting then i think that's what i think that's what happened to me yeah they're they're you know it's just kind of stuff because after you go to a certain point there's you don't feel like there's much more you can do yeah yeah but basically all that's left is to stick the music in front of them and let them play right because they'll do the rest on their own yeah because they know the notes now it's just they have to do it themselves but yeah yeah my my mom took piano for thirteen years when she was younger yeah she still plays once in a while really i bet she's good yeah yeah she does the Mozart Mozart and Chopin and Beethoven stuff she sits down and plays all that the hard stuff that i never got around to yeah yeah yeah uh we had to give concerts and all that in college yeah with our majors so well it's it's tough not bad yeah now i now i play guitar you do um bass guitar or yes electric uh rhythm electric oh okay yeah i would that's one thing i never learned to play and i wish i would have is guitar i i've never had formal lessons i just would sit down and listen to the music and figure it out how to play it really that's great yeah i wish i had an ear like that because i can sight read yeah but i can't ear any i can't hear or i can't you know listen to something and play it yeah uh the the only other problem i have with it is that i've never learned how to learn the the notes for guitar that's real tough for me uh-huh in other words where the fingers would go for the different notes and everything uh-huh and so when if i ever have a conversation with somebody else that plays guitar they start naming off notes and i go whoa you lost me stop oh just sing it to me i and so i can't read tabulates or anything else like that that go along with it so i just have to listen to the music and oh you know pick it out well that that's good though because then you can hear something and play it instead of waiting for the music and yeah yeah yeah that would be good and that's even better for bands even i think yeah yeah to be able to do that yeah that's neat makes makes it easier whenever somebody is trying to teach you a song you just go show me where it goes and i'll do it uh-huh rather than them going play an A play an E play a B yeah that that is good i like that so like um what bands do you listen to oh i i listen to the the more heavier rock uh Kiss White Snake Scorpions stuff like that yeah yeah um i like Kiss but they haven't been out too long i mean they haven't done anything recently well they so the rest of them came out let's see uh-huh about two years ago yeah they and that was the one they came out without the makeup and they haven't been with makeup for quite a while have they right uh they took off their makeup back their it's my favorite group that's why i know a lot about them um they took off their makeup in eighty i believe it was uh-huh in eighty yeah yeah that was something you know they had they had five or six albums since they took off their makeup but yeah i i have the one and i can't remember what the name is now but they put all the um it was one of their um best hits uh Smashes and Thrashes and Hits yeah yes that's it and i just love that tape that is great yeah but now they're trying to convert me because i just moved here from South Dakota and uh they're trying to convert me to Country and i am just not i Country person fight them fight them all the way yeah i'm just not a Country Western person yeah i'm i'm not either uh my my dad listens to it and it just it drives me up a wall uh-huh yeah i'm that's one thing i'd you would think in a in a Midwest that you would but i i never grew up that way so yeah  well i've been real um thinking i'd love to buy a new car right now if i could afford it but we have two cars right now and we're still paying on but i would love to have one of these new minivans i've got two little ones and i think that would be just the perfect family car i right now my car is terminally ill so i am really looking at uh facing the purchase of a car oh and uh what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that i won't do it uh well i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible well what is it oh and uh you know i don't even like the wind blowing on me so i don't know why i think i want one but i do uh i will probably stay with a foreign make i've had real good luck with them yeah we have um we have we went out to buy an American car so we bought um a Chevy Nova about three years ago and then we opened up the the hood and it said Toyota made in Japan right across the front of all the engine parts is that right um-hum Toyota uh well the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry uh at that time was the same car so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to i thought that was pretty insensitive oh well i didn't realize it i knew that one of the that Nissan which is Toyota had uh joined with had a plant over here and and i didn't know if it was General Motors or who but i i never thought of yeah i don't know uh you think of Chevrolet and the good old USA um-hum um-hum that's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written i mean imprinted on the engine it was real interesting huh but uh i with so many options now available you know where where cars are concerned it just seems like there is there's almost too much of a choice anymore you know that there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car i would take into consideration the price naturally but um you know i would really want something that i would want for that much money for ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever uh well yeah and that's minimum oh yeah definitely it you know it's it's a major purchase now what we used to pay for homes is now what a car can cost i cannot imagine that you know somebody i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollars car about oh oh it would how exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase and i thought i don't think i'd find that exciting i'd be wondering you know here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money if they held their value that would be one thing but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated that's true yeah and you know that i don't know that i'll go with i've bought a new car the last three that i've bought and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again yeah well we got a pretty we bought our Chevrolet brand new and then we bought a used car just a minute i'll change your diaper the we bought our our next car used and uh we had better luck with our used car and i like it more it cost us less money and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money well i'm i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car if you can find one that's reliable uh you know reliable if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from or you know make sure that you can have it checked out well enough well some people you know some people have to have a new car every year uh i wouldn't or it you know at the most every two years and they don't drive them that much especially your foreign cars yeah like a Honda or uh a Toyota fifty thousand is just getting broken in for them yeah and if i can find one or a repossession that's we bought one like that and with the banks being in such financial you know problems now that people you can find the banks willing to sell you a car uh-huh we bought one car that way and had we bought it real reasonably and it was in real nice condition so because apparently whatever the bank get  wondering how you keep up on the news primarily with our local newspaper and TV um-hum i listen to the radio but not um not like i did when i was working i am recently retired to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on TV how do you gain your news i guess the i get the Washington Post and that is pretty big newspaper and i think that's almost exclusive my exclusively my first of the news though i have the radio on when i go to work i don't think the news usually hits because i'm not going right on the hour oh i see well that's that is one of the handicaps with both TV and yeah and radio if you're not available on the hour or half hour then you lose out on an awful lot well what is your newspaper that is the Washington Post is that correct i have read that when we were in that area and it it's a splendid newspaper right um-hum so what more do we need to discuss tonight that seems like a very short one right i think that you know we've we've resolved the issue and that's what we were asked to do well i can discuss a lot of the news that we have but um i feel that that's not part of our responsibility right right so thank you for calling oh okay well thanks for discussing it bye-bye all right good night  well the types of vacations that i usually take i usually come back more tired after my vacation then i do you know before i take it um i need to definitely take a vacation where all all i do is rest and i i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home oh but um the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida i enjoy the beach okay i am after our last summer's vacation i am antibeach uh-huh we went to uh Cape Hatteras antibeach uh-huh well we we were out visiting one of our kids in Maryland then we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days and uh uh the the waves were huge i've never quite seen waves like this one and uh i was standing in water not more than uh-huh um-hum in just barely above my ankles and uh you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles and i was standing there talking to my daughter and this really big wave came and totally threw me and one uh-huh right foot did not come out of the sand and it tore the ligaments in my knee so i'm never going to another beach again i'm a more uh-huh you might be like i am i enjoy i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas but i really don't like to get into water the water the ocean i prefer a swimming pool well i I love to go and play around at least i always did but although actually my i like the mountains i uh i don't really like hot weather that's my biggest gripe about living here and i basically uh-huh um-hum don't wanna go to a hot place on vacation um i my dream vacation is Alaska right i can understand that uh-huh that would be nice this is just someplace i've always wanted to go and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there uh-huh i know i've taken several vacations to Colorado and i used to live in Colorado oh sometime ago for a couple of years and i really enjoyed that um-hum yeah i'd i'd like that uh i haven't been to Yellowstone for a long long time and i would uh we've been talking about going there next summer uh i don't know we'll have to to uh-huh yeah i've never been up to the Yellowstone area so it's been a long time but you know it seems when your family is is different places a lot of trips involved going to visit that's right that's right you got that oh i'm we usually go up to Wisconsin at least once a year because this is where my husband and i are both from and um-hum my mother and his mother live up there feeling lost and alone because we moved down here and uh um-hum um-hum we've got one of our our kids lives out on the East Coast and so we have to you know go to those well you have you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then right well i know but i'm tired of them i wanna go someplace different up there uh my my idea i guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with uh money be no object that's right right you know so just absolutely you know first class fly where i want to rent a car if i want to um-hum uh you know just really the nicest hotels and stuff like that and and not worry if somebody says well let's take this little side trip you know and not have to sit there and figure out um um-hum you know can we we fit that in there or now that uh that that's what i um right uh-huh yes that's what i would like to do i have no interest for example in taking a cruise to me why anybody wanna ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling um-hum it would be sort of confining i feel like it would be confining yeah you know i would rather much rather get on a plane and get there and then enjoy myself um-hum yeah i just uh that that does absolutely nothing for me uh-huh but uh i don't know i can say that i think my my favorite spots are still to go to go where there's mountains and and lot of trees and and wildlife to view and and uh i like that kind of stuff i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery yes i i agree i can i can do that too and um you know i think if i had if i had the money i would probably go to Europe every year because of you know i think that they have they have it all over there in just a a few tiny two two miles you know there's mountains and there's beaches and it's all right there so um-hum yeah uh i i guess i've never really thought about it that way our uh we have our daughter who's almost thirteen but she's uh a very picky eater and our our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is um-hum you know gee Holly would starve to death if we you know we took her to another country so oh right but i i would like if you know it was anywhere in the world to go i guess even though it's hot i would like to go to Africa  real excited when i heard this that's why i've been trying to call all day because i keep getting these subjects like capital punishment so football i love this this is great well we're from Colorado so we're Bronco fans oh yes and um we just moved here two years ago and they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here and they lost again that was pretty pitiful but they seem to be doing pretty good this year well i was from Illinois originally and i grew up a Bear fan and uh then we moved here even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans oh and we had some wonderful wonderful years there under Roger Staubach we kind of got spoiled yeah we expected it to continue forever i think they're doing pretty well this year though well they haven't they haven't have they just lost one game this year i think two i know they lost yeah to Washington and Philadelphia two yeah but they're not doing bad people are pretty surprised that they i mean they beat the Giants yeah and wasn't that fun i went went to the balloon festival in Plano and carried my little portable radio with me and i must say i attracted a lot of attention people running up saying oh what's the score what's the score i bet oh boy i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television yep and now then i wasn't i had forgotten or i probably wouldn't have been there yeah yeah well i am i'm a big football fan i never was my father was a football fan my whole life and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff and i just hated it and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on Sundays yeah and uh so when i met my husband he was watching football and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend i couldn't see him until like Tuesday because Monday Night Football if i didn't like football so that's exactly where both of the wives came from i think it was uh you know it's easier to join them than fight them yep um-hum um-hum and if you wanna see them you might just as well enjoy football and i used to tease my husband sometimes and say my gosh you know did you bet the house or something this week to get so excited about these games yeah uh-huh well i do i just i love it it's such i just think it's such a fun sport and uh i'm just hoping that the Broncos can get back on their feet we're not convinced that we're gonna be Cowboy fans yet but uh well i guess we'll first have to get to used to the idea that we're staying here that's even harder but well it takes a little brainwashing first yeah are you uh transit usually i mean do you stay not in one place too long um-hum no we're just this is only the second place we've lived we've only been married for five and a half years and uh we have two small children and he had a uh just got transferred here to E Systems well it'll take you a little while but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for for Denver oh oh well i tell you this the weather here and there's no mountains or anything you know and when you go to a football game in Colorado it's you know there's snow and it's an adventure and here you know you just got to drive down to the to the stadium and uh oh i know well if they close it in see we'll have the best of both worlds then as they're talking about doing but uh Dan Reeves a pretty neat guy anyway yes well he's from here yeah that's right you know he was one of ours one of our boys so we are never we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys so yeah that's what i hear which is rare yep which is good yeah but uh i you know it's funny in in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last i don't know five or six years whatever it's been um they have these songs on the radio they take modern popular songs and and change them to fit uh the Broncos and stuff and they had i was just thinking about one the other day uh if i saw a picture of John Elway in the in the cafeteria at school um but they did the Johnny Angel they did Johnny Elway to that um-hum Johnny Elway and i'm uh i was trying to get my son to sing that my husband was just having a fit don't have him sing that song but they they do a lot of fun things i think football is football's kind of a a sport that i think you kind of it's hard not to like it do you know there's just well there's so much about it to like you know it's so exciting and when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here course they put together some real cute songs and we all ran out and bought the records and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item it's exciting yeah yeah yeah they probably i i wish i would've bought the tape when i was in uh Texas in Colorado because uh i i think about that a lot but you know when i first moved here was when they well no i guess it was about a year ago they did this this interstate seventy five song or or um-hum whatever it was about Central Expressway and getting it done in nineteen ninety five and everything that was kind of a funny song but they sure do it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here even when they were losing pitifully you know people still support them we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs we love the Cowboys  well i don't know if there's gonna be a solutions to the US budget well i know it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure um-hum it's only getting worse exponentially it seems um yes exactly there's uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybody's pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that um-hum oh which state is that uh state of Minnesota uh-huh so there's the potential that perhaps you know the US budget might wanna take a look at it's uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well let's freeze wages i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shirt that's got to be very short term um-hum right right and and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying well we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh yep for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars right and it was just i mean you can go to Kmart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats so yep yeah definitely i think that there's probably a lot of so it gives you an idea that waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place sure sure so i mean there was um people at Stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um uh-huh for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was uh-huh and i think that that may be more widespread than we think sure than well than we'd like to think but but then sure yeah you know it's something that's hard to enforce too i'm sure um-hum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know they're getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that and it's a real big crunch um-hum right uh of course when they get caught then they're you know they're guilty of course but uh during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them um-hum well that's right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the um-hum problem i mean when you look at sure something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows um-hum how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles exactly and i i don't think uh it's ended up being i mean it gave people jobs and yeah but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay we'll do this during this point and time but after that that's you know um they didn't wanna do it anymore right um-hum so a lot of things that they're saying that they're no longer gonna be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so um-hum i don't know okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening right okay all right you too bye-bye uh-huh thanks bye now  okay what kind of pet do you have Gail well i don't i have children i have little children both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets but we've had lots of them in the past oh you have children have you uh what have you had um-hum well we had a dog before we moved here uh and we couldn't bring her with us we came from Colorado and we've had hamsters and fish and birds and oh well you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up well we had a a Schnauzer that we lost this summer and he was fourteen years old and uh cats uh-huh we've had two Schnauzers and before that we had all Dachshunds and i think my husband wants another Dachshund and we're trying to debate because our children are grown and and uh i don't know whether we really want to be tied down to a pet you know another dog and we do have a very loving cat that's you know kind of our baby um-hum and uh and we like pets we like them around we have grandchildren that run through and they think we should have a dog and that's because they have a Great Dane which is huge um yes definitely well we you know if it um if it were just more peaceful you know with the little ones we would definitely have a pet i just think it's nice have around we had a cat though that had kittens so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered oh yes yes because uh i did that experience was awful yes i have never wanted a that's why we've never gotten a female you know in anything and uh uh um-hum and our male cat you know we had uh neutered right away and course it he doesn't know it and he's still out partying um but um you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just had her have her spayed you know and uh well a lot of times now when you buy them from like the SPCA or yes and the humane societies or whatever their adoption includes their spaying yes yes which i think is a good thing it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved and you know so hum-um um-hum it uh plus uh you know the safety factor and stuff well we enjoy having pets we uh you know i think they're a lot of company and and when my mother lived with us uh the cat was really hers and and he was kind of wild our our daughter found her and brought her to us and uh that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap and she was the only one at first that you know could really hold him you know because he was really skittish but it was like he knew oh um-hum you know and he'd sleep with her and so he was a lot of company to her you know and and just love her and he's cats are usually so independent but this one you know he comes up and he crawls up next to my husband now you know uh yeah he's you know right before the dog died we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side and the cat would sleep on my husband's side you know and when everybody turned we all four of us turned in a row uh-hum my husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room but our cat would sleep with us and he hated that uh-huh did he um-hum he just thought that they belong and when he'd she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head he hated that uh-huh so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal uh-huh um-hum i think that's one of the reasons our because as i said our our Schnauzer was old and so he was becoming incontinent and so then i would generally have messes in the house and i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with you know um-hum oh yeah and uh and it was new carpeting and you know it just just really you know upset me no end and uh um-hum oh that would Greg's um my husband's grandparents have a dog and they just it needs to be put to sleep but it's grandpa's dog and he he is really getting too old to take care of it but the dog messes all over the carpet and my daughter is just nine months old oh and so then she crawls on the carpet oh the smell i mean it's just really awful and that's that's one real drawback but um-hum you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough yes you will you will you know we were trying to decide uh you know about putting him to sleep he was just you know he was getting so old and had that other problems too and and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier you know and and again going through that because our our animals are almost like our kids in some ways you know and and you grieve just as much over them when they go um-hum you know as you would a child and and you know our son and and his wife and our daughter and her husband the grandkids all say get a dog get a dog you know and i'm saying be quiet be quiet and and i can tell my husband you know deep down he you know he really  okay i don't do you have a opinion on that on the USR well the i think i'm i'm skeptical about the whole thing uh and a little still a little bit worried about them because of the history the history of Russia uh-huh and they're in a in a state of flux right now changing uh you uh changing a great deal primarily because of the economic distress sure um-hum sure and even in that situation uh the it seems like to me from what i've read in in the history of Russia and and you know different authors uh there has always been a paranoia they've always suspected everybody and and that's why they put you know that's why they put a lot of people in prison for years and years and that's why they put a lot of people to death sure sure that happens yeah Stalin Staling was a was a classical example i guess of that paranoia because he he probably killed more Russians than uh you know the Russian army killed anybody else uh-huh sure i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war uh they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together but i could not foresee them severing what they have with the US um because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation um from what i've been hearing is the USSR uh USSR has been uh almost bankrupt for years and it's people are desperate and there might be a revolution within the people but i don't think the US would get involved with it because uh there's too close of ties to where yeah i think they understand that Gorbachev is trying to make a change and that we cannot run them like we run the US and that they have to make their own independent decision so i guess i really have no fear at all of the USSR verses uh you get these small little uh places like Iraq and all of that that sure might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons versus a a small uh or the big country of USSR i i i have no feelings that they would ever start a war with us because to them it would totally you know it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time yeah so i mean sure they have weapons to kill us over and over and over but to them that would be a suicide and they and the Russian people are not suicidal type of people but if you get the Iraqis and Iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of you know doing whatever uh for their country they'll do it uh yeah you're uh i think you're right there's a little more craziness down there uh the Russian people i think are not that much different from us you know i think they're that it would be the leadership that i'd i'd uh mistrust sure sure um-hum sure i have a daughter that's frustrated she's on a a stool that she can get up on but it if she can't get down on it it's like get me down right now but anyway it was really good talking to you and you have a good weekend yeah you to thank you bye-bye uh-huh thank you bye now  uh how do you feel about this topic um i think it's just fine but um i just worry about some things that show up as drugs that aren't like i've heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium i think they're in the same family right and just little things like that that um you might get in big trouble for and just because you ate a roll with poppy seeds on it you know right i understand completely you know i i feel the same way um-hum you know i i believe in drug testing um-hum you know there's nothing wrong with that because something like that if you work in some some types of some type of situations that makes it um makes you unmanageable or something like that that you could either hurt yourself or somebody else um-hum um-hum uh i might really agree with it you know if they tell you before you come into employment like when you're going to get hired um-hum um-hum you know i don't see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random um you know the i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out and i'll pick you out well random and you go through the drug test random i heard was to make it fair so they wouldn't think you're just picking on somebody what's that now i've just heard that the random testing like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever is just so they can't be accused of you know picking on someone in particular that they're suspicious about you know uh-huh uh-huh yeah that's true but um because i work at a school and they were thinking about doing that that's true were they yeah but even though they were i mean who's to say it's random or not you know right and who's to say if it's for sure they could just uh-huh they could be saying it's random and they could be not random uh-huh so yeah where i you can't prove prove that yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time huh and we were like okay um-hum but we did have to sign that um-hum but um well i just worry uh you know i don't care so much about well i mean they can they'll get fired whether they do their job or not you know if the drugs affect their job that much but right um i just worry about people that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and right stuff like that or air traffic controllers yeah exactly or pilots or right or even somebody on a line you know that could run machinery or something like that um-hum um-hum yeah that's how i feel too um-hum i don't know have you been in Dallas a long time or um-hum about twelve years about twelve years um-hum i just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom hum that you see a drug test um-hum but i think like if you work in defense like i know people have had to have drug tests for that and uh-huh but then they have like a secret clearance uh-huh but um then i know people that work at um you know normal companies and uh-huh some do and some don't require drug testing you know if it affected the work they might you know wonder but it's not required because i was really surprised because i i go into my major is in accounting um-hum and i've looked at an accounting positions um-hum and definitely a a position i've applied for has either come up um-hum or you know they won't make you go through one hum even to change position which was a real surprise what's that to change positions no to get a position i just moved here in June oh um-hum and uh from South Dakota and i was real you know shocked to here how many that did um-hum you know from where i'm from it's not that popular or that much i think hum so a lot more here i guess because it's a big big city or yes yeah you know like Dallas has got more people than the whole state of South Dakota and we're closer to Mexico yes that's very true uh-huh and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didn't know it was to a an extent um-hum and uh i'm glad it's there you know but um um-hum it was just something that i come across that i wasn't really you know used to but you know i i feel fine with it you know that's not a problem um-hum um-hum me neither and uh but i'm there's some people that i think there's a cheerleader that's suing a school for wanting to drug test her and i haven't heard if she's going to win or not but um like a high school uh-huh can high can a high school do that but because hum can a high school do that um i think because it she's in the extracurricular thing cheerleading uh-huh uh-huh they they said they could but um i think she's going to try and use like the constitution against them uh-huh saying it's an invasion of her privacy or something like that and and i don't know she might win i'm not sure i haven't heard uh-huh yeah i've never heard of a high school asking a student to do that i guess um-hum huh that is that in Dallas or um-hum um-hum that's in Dallas oh the high school that she's from yeah uh-huh um no i think it's out further west maybe California or something um-hum oh really huh i thought see i teach so i thought you meant where i teach oh you do teach uh-huh in Richardson in Richardson oh really um-hum um my brother is the Admissions Director at UTD he's the what the Admissions Director for UTD oh um-hum so i kind of know something about Richardson but um-hum yeah how neat so he's um decides if the students  all right now since i'm from the great Midwest north you know we're right on Lake Erie uh i'm sure our climates are much different than yours are typically today we've got uh rain we're forecasting a little bit of sleet and uh which means i'm not gonna do any lawn and gardening today that's for sure yes i can understand so i don't know what's the weather down there and oh it's nice and sunny here uh it's uh little little Christmas uh crispness in the air uh-huh and uh delightful to be outside yeah and right now i'm watering yeah it's not are you really we avoid having to send you a little bit yes and my lawn is very green and my flowers are still blooming uh-huh well i have that oh you do i still have that we have mums and geraniums that are still holding their own out there uh lot of the other ones i've i've already had to pull out um-hum uh at this point i'm ready to start putting in uh some bulbs i'm waiting for a decent some decent weather for that i got uh about two hundred bulbs i've got to put in uh-huh right but i have a uh mine's a new home and we just really did the landscaping this year so i've got about all the gardening i want for the year so i'll be anxious to to let it rest for a little bit uh-huh but uh somebody i talked to last week was said they had the uh they had problems doing some of the work down there because they they really had some heat hanging on well course that's a constant factor down here what you have to do is uh keep your uh keep your ground uh watered um-hum and uh the heat really doesn't bother you if you have the right kind of flowers yeah all right or and the right kind of lawn for that matter uh-huh i have a tiff Bermuda lawn here and uh it requires a lot of water and you have to keep it cut very short if you want it to look like a golf course green um-hum i don't uh get to it that often so mine doesn't look like a golf course course but it is very nice and uh and shiny and uh very thin grass oh i see grows real close together uh-huh that's very okay it's very very different than ours because ours ours we get into a lot of combinations of rye and Kentucky Blue um-hum and uh plus the usual amount of crabgrass and weeds and everything else that pops through and uh but we've had an a terrible drought this year and everybody's going through the same kind of problems in fact we developed on a new lawn we developed what they call rust and it's a fungus which is very very rare but our whole area they're all new homes and new lawns and it was it was very very much in evidence this year as everything turns yellow turns yellow early huh well it just turns yellow where it shouldn't and you walk across walk across the lawn and your shoes will actually come out rust colored and it's it's not it's not a disease it's a disease and not a lack of a of chemicals no it's it's a fungus and they claim that it is caused by stress to the lawn it it won't kill the lawn but it sure doesn't do much for the looks of the lawn huh um-hum and uh the alternative is a lot of uh nitrogen overpowering with nitrogen fertilizer and certain chemicals but everybody is so chemical shy anymore that we steered clear of it and hopefully you know come spring come spring it will be cleared up and everything will be back to normal well i have grub worms here off and on i try to keep them under control they live right up under the surface of the ground and they eat the roots of your grass and then you have ground brown uh patches develop um-hum oh yeah that's when you first notice it but you can put some uh chemical on that and kill them out and keep them under control you never destroy them um-hum you enjoy lawn work oh very much so uh we have a lake house down at Cedar Creek Texas seventy five miles uh north uh or rather uh uh southeast uh southeast of uh Dallas um-hum and uh i have to to grow uh rye grass down there because we're not there to water although we have a watering system no one's there to turn it on and i guess uh um-hum well we don't have an automatic sprinkler either see so yeah uh or automatic on the sprinkler system um-hum but uh you know the rye grass and the uh wild grass that grow makes us a nice lawn um-hum yeah it sounds nice Cedar Lake i'm not uh but oh it's a very large uh man-made lake uh in Texas it's about uh a hundred and uh fifty miles i guess in Fort Worth oh i see and it supplies Fort Worth with it's drinking water okay okay and then a hundred and eighty miles further south of there uh or rather a hundred and eighty miles from Fort Worth about forty miles south of Cedar Creek is another mammoth lake that Fort Worth owns um-hum that it uses to water yeah that's interesting i never realized the uh the amount of lake  so do you have an opinion on credit cards um i do you do what do what do you think about them i think they get a lot of people in trouble yeah definitely i have one right now and um i just got it about eight six months ago and i find that it it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get uh-huh yeah and then you don't stop to realize that you know you charge this for twenty charge that for twenty charge this for twenty and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars and you don't stop to think about it yeah i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble oh my goodness and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a Visa card and i never use them unless i need to really so that's good yeah yeah i'd i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up so but they yeah that's a good idea that's stops all them interest rates and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway yeah that but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially you know we have i'm in Lubbock and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to Tech and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot um-hum i have i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out and they they can't do anything but work to try to pay them off and and and like one of my friends yeah she has hers is up to nine hundred dollars and she does she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school jeez and and so i mean that's just enough to pay rent and buy like thirty five dollars worth of food a month so and and pay for her like like monthly fee like twenty yeah you have i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the so all she's paying is interest on hers every month yeah something like that yeah it just seems crazy to to me but well my wife got in trouble one time with hers and she was making like i don't know what she was making forty five dollars a month i think and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit and fifteen dollars of it was interest so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month yeah so and that was before we got married so but it's you know we sat down and talked about it and discussed it and it's it's come out pretty good now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college and oh really that's the first thing he wanted was it Visa card yeah oh my goodness so we kind of discussed that a little bit and shot that idea down right quick i bet you know so yeah i'm i don't know i'm about sick of mine right now i don't but i think they're too readily accessible and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you draft get you trapped i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it but that's a lot of pain and hassle when um-hum you know in the olden days when my parents were growing up and uh we couldn't afford everything we didn't have such things as credit cards we just waited till time come around that we could afford it and you know we had all the necessities so right and i very seldom use a credit card on necessities i always use it for something i want not something i need exactly yeah my parents are really good about so not using credit cards they are against it i don't think they like the fact that i have one either yeah i think if credit cards were as as stringent as say a a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to you know be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills we probably wouldn't have the problems we have um-hum course we wouldn't have the retail market we have either so i guess they'd trade one for the other yeah i disagree with it but they still trade one for the other hm well that's good i'm it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for you sound pretty young so yeah i'm nineteen i'm twenty right now so just going to school and are you yeah and working so all right it does kind of get in when you want something that like last weekend was homecoming and i needed a pair of shoes so i just went out and bought them and on my credit card i didn't didn't have the money to do it yeah yeah it's pretty easy yep it sure is so do you just have two kids or uh we have a eighteen year old a seventeen year old and a seven year old oh really yeah neat i'm from Plano Texas oh are you but right now i'm out in Provo Utah going to BYU so are you a you're a Mormon then yep uh-huh all right yep but this is a extra long one what's that hey they're giving us a lot of time oh yeah they may not they must not have too much traffic on Saturdays yeah have you done a lot of this uh fifteen or twenty i guess oh really oh yeah do you do it every day i try to every day i uh i get calls at work i get calls at home so what  okay as far as uh universal health care um um-hum i guess i'm all for it i think it's time that we start looking at um getting into that um health cost has continued to rise and i think uh there's people that to me it's the fundamental uh life life of a person um it it doesn't matter if you have money or no money or all the money in the world um you would you should still be everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits um i think if uh they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and uh individuals um helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how but uh the expenses right now for health care um are just unreal well they really are even for even when you're not talking about surgery if you're just talking about basic care we've yes we've got four children and you know in the past month they it just they pass things from one to one and it just can devastate your budget you know um um-hum oh sure and your constantly exactly yeah the only i i know that um uh i know a little bit about the uh European uh universal health care and there's some pros and cons one of the things of course is everybody gets health care but uh sometimes health care uh when you get into a universal system lacks in uh what would be considered uh how can i say it um over like in Poland uh where my father-in-law lived for years their their health care system is um because no financial gains are available for doctors uh they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason but most people that go in to being a physician here in the US do it for financial gain yeah they say well jeez if i get into this area of dermatology i don't have to do this i can do this and i can you know can still make big bucks yeah or plastic surgery or uh if i become a uh heart specialist i'm gonna make this kind of money uh and there's you know financial gains toward that and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors do you think that the quality um it would would be as high the quality i think goes down um-hum when you have a universal system um yeah yeah the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check um and also offering some kind of because i think uh all physicians well anybody um likes the ability ability to kind of uh get themselves financially uh situated uh i guess that's the whole US concept is to come here and right more motivation yeah and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system maybe you know there's a way of working that out but i know that in Poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it that's what they look at it as there's no yeah uh and that's sad because if that's the case if if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway but right yeah that might be one way of weeding out those that are greedy for the money and those that really want to help mankind that's true yeah i uh so but i i think we have to head toward that way well we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured and and you know you cannot i mean it's just uh-huh i'm worried when i get older you know and uh let's say for instance you uh oh sure get fired or or not fired but maybe laid off from your job you no longer have insurance right i mean and you're sixty some or uh fifty some years old you try try to find insurance um-hum oh yeah i mean you're you're uninsurable unless you want to pay five hundred six hundred dollars a month and i know people that are paying two hundred three hundred dollars a month for insurance that's right yeah and how they can do it i have no idea um i know working for small corporations and health insurance um myself um it would cost for a family and this was back three four years ago to put my entire family up and this was working for like a medcenter uh health plan um it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck so yeah well ours ours is three hundred for our family and i mean we that is we pay that instead of a car payment you know i mean i'm driving a piece of junk you know see yeah well we do the same i mean it's i think uh people are changing their viewpoints of you know it's getting harder and harder to survive right and uh and that's why uh if they don't go to a universal system something's going to happen we're gonna have uh see yeah uh larger amount of people dying  uh what kind of car would you uh buy next well that's a good question we just got in from looking at cars and we've probably been looking at them for a couple months and we haven't bought one yet so that almost answers the question how about you oh you have okay oh and you haven't um we just bought one um we bought one about a month ago it was a ninety one Ford Thunderbird oh um we really liked it because um we just moved here from South Dakota and we have we do some quite a bit of traveling and that was a nice car to travel in but we have also a Ford Probe and that's better to get around town in because the Thunderbird takes a lot of gas uh-huh yeah um-hum but um the reason we're stuck on Fords i guess is because i used to sell Fords and so we're kind of stuck on that kind of a car but i really like um that kind of car myself but well we we've been looking at just about everything i guess because we really don't need a car we just sort of want the luxury of buying a new car and um yeah i don't know we were today we were looking at Lexuses and we keep going back to Cadillacs oh do you and looking at those and then you don't know if you wanna spend thirty thousand dollars and buy a new car or whether you wanna buy uh like a ninety one Cadillac a ninety or ninety one for you know twenty or nineteen or fifteen you can get them yeah um-hum yeah fairly cheap compared to buying a brand new one and the new Lexus that that they have that you you pay sticker price for those a Lexus yeah uh-huh and isn't that neat though that is a neat car don't you think yes yes we we were we were all in them today but you know when it comes to oops were you you know do you wanna spend about thirty thousand dollars and uh it'd probably be a little over that with the tax so that's that's really where right oh i know where we are or should we just buy you know a little Volkswagen we've right we've you know the one of those Cabriolets i guess they're called uh it's a convertible it's sort of like you know square in the back yeah and get around town uh-huh yeah i like those but the the selling point i guess that that i or it has to pass my test i'm i'm short and i need to sit in the seat see if i can get the seat high enough to see over the steering wheel like i like to see are you shorter yeah i'm about five two are you oh then that's yeah and to make sure the seat belt doesn't hit me in the neck that it comes really over the shoulder and not up around your neck so yeah it's got to be a comfortable car right well it can be comfortable but those things not all the seat belts are gonna work that way nor can i get all the seats up high enough right uh-huh to do that so uh so on those we just we just forget about yeah that certainly helps and we've been looking at cars with leather seats but uh uh-huh i don't know this is a new experience for us just just mainly because my uh my mother had died which meant that we were coming into some money that we could yeah splurge and buy a car but but yet it's difficult to do though when you're not used to it so that's why we're we're out uh oh and isn't that nice yeah sort of doing this and uh yeah buying a car is hard you never know for sure if you're getting a good deal yeah well we've always bought used cars before and they haven't been very expensive um so this is just just a new um-hum a new thing you know we've had vans we've had a new van and you know some other another new car that that wasn't used but the prices are what uh-huh used to buy a house for yeah oh i know because we came down here and you know and well you know from down here it but price of housing is a lot different um-hum i bet but the but the price of our house up in Aberdeen was as much as some cars and it's like you know oh my goodness um-hum right it's hard to adjust to it and and you just don't want to really no because it's like this thing it moves moves and could be wrecked and that's like we you know get a house for this and uh it just blows our mind um but um-hum that's right uh-huh well i hope you enjoy your car uh we we looked at Thunderbirds um i guess maybe about a couple weeks ago we seem to do this every oh yeah uh-huh um-hum every weekend we've been out looking for for we still haven't bought yet so i guess every every month we don't buy we save more money than we we're just shopping shopping is free until you buy yeah that's right interest yeah well that's great you know because you might as well get what you want you know yeah but it would be it would be nice our son works for EDS and and we could use his um oh really discount that he gets through General Motors yes that's right except uh we were only out looking at General Motors cars except Cadillac and we're not looking at the at the new ones anyway and in the Cadillacs and they're not using they're not getting um discounts on the new uh-huh Cadillacs that we're looking would would be looking at to begin with so uh-huh are you in Dallas yes Plano yeah so am i are you looking at the Crest or Crest um-hum yeah we were just got back from there yeah that was our last stop about you know about eight thirty i said oh we can always swing around Crest so there we go and we're swinging around yes we've gotten two cars two used cars from Crest you did uh-huh and we got our i oh you and good  well let's see we're supposed to talk about movies yes uh have you seen any recently or i don't uh i'm trying to think i have not gone out to a movie we rent a few but i haven't rented rented one real lately so you name a few that you've seen see if i've seen them um we just went out to one about couple weeks ago it was Necessary Roughness the one that was filmed in Denton i've not seen it i've not seen it but i've heard a little bit about it yeah it it was pretty good but i i don't know if if you saw this and you weren't in Dallas or around Texas if you'd understand some of it oh is that right yes i don't know if it'd be good if you were outside of Texas but well i i was just reading about it though and it's uh it's been a sleeper hit it's already grossed like forty million dollars oh really so it's it's actually becoming a pretty good hit across the United States well that's good it it yeah that's good um let's see so they are liking it and uh it's just i think just a silly entertaining movie movie from what the articles i've read about it which you know you go just to be entertained and and people are liking it for that yeah that's what it is uh-huh yeah and and that's good um that's pretty much what it was about it was just uh you know a a comedy you know just a a football team that was bad and come up you know uh-huh uh-huh yeah and uh we just moved here from South Dakota and uh Dances With Wolves was filmed up there when we were there um-hum and we saw that where they filmed they filmed it in Pierre South Dakota and that's where we went to see it did you right oh oh you went out and watched them film um yeah they the buffalo and all that on the ranch um my father-in-law owns a plane and he um took us to the buffalo ranch and where they you know use the buffalo to film and uh-huh um-hum and uh took us out there and you never knew that there was so much land that was not developed you know until you go you know and see that yes but um i bet that's true a lot of wide open spaces out there i've never been up that direction i'd like to yeah it's nice the main thing i think about is that it gets so cold in the winter up there it is it's like thirty now you know it's between thirty and forty and we we've just moved here and we call people back there and they just can't believe that we're still wearing shorts and going out and wow and and will occasionally up until Thanksgiving probably is that when it starts changing well we'll we'll have some cold days you know like uh in in uh October and September you know we had some pretty cold nights but uh uh-huh uh-huh but uh up until Thanksgiving really uh well we usually get our first frost middle of November okay yeah they've had two already two freezes somewhere uh-huh so and so and that was a really good movie and it lasted three hours do you have the time three hours that's the only complaint i've heard about that it's so long yeah it's it's really long but i don't know it didn't feel like it was that long but after you got out and thought oh wow it was longer but um Kevin Costner was really good in that uh-huh passes fast huh it's oh i like him everything i've seen him in i've liked real well oh i think he's great um-hum he's you know done uh i can't remember now but the baseball show um yeah uh Field of Dreams yeah that was good i saw that one yes Field of Dreams and have you seen Robin Hood with him in it or no i haven't i haven't either and i've heard that's just great i bet it is is uh i've not even i don't think i've even read i usually read the uh critics in uh Time and People and i pretty well agree with their thinking on most movies um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh but i've i've don't believe i've read one about Robin Hood yet it's already it's yeah it's released isn't it um-hum yeah it's probably been out for you know like a month now yeah yeah maybe that's why they'll get to it shortly yeah but uh is it on uh video yet um no huh-uh i don't think it's out on video yet i still think it's at the theaters uh-huh uh-huh but um i need to get that Dances With Wolves i would sort of like it at first i thought uh i don't know you know uh-huh well i'm tired of having these Indians everybody pushed down our throats how we've mistreated them so and all that oh and see that's how we've you know we come out of it going yeah we come out of it going you know it's it's hard you know for us you know it was a good movie it interpreted what happened then but i'm sick of all that uh-huh it brought out a lot that isn't going on now that they again felt that they were you know being so mistreated and and and yes and it was not what we mean now you know right uh pushing a little too far yeah yeah that's that's the very reason i have not even rented it from the video i i and everyone that uh i've talked to has said yes you'll love it you'll love it and i'm sure i will uh-huh um-hum but uh and i'm sure i'll see it before too long because that's quite a deal you know being up in there in South Dakota where we have to pay the government funds to them and keep the tribes going and and you know it it hurts me because i bet it is uh-huh uh-huh you know i have to keep paying this but yet i don't feel that i did anything to them but you know we have to keep doing this and you know that's true that's true you know uh just because our ancestors did certain things they did it i think as a matter of survival and not to be right and how they lived brutish to other to some other people you know right and and how they lived is very different from what we try to do now and and i feel that yeah we're not working with territory or things like that now that we're overpowering somebody's territory or something like that now but uh-huh uh-huh yes but um you know i've i've seen a lot of Julia Roberts movies i like Julia i do too i like her i uh i'm trying to think what my favorite with her was uh oh what is it where  okay i've got a you know i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balanced again and that's get half of the government rid of the half the government payroll i think that would probably uh be very possible and and and we really wouldn't feel it in our services not all i you know i don't know if you've ever been to Washington DC yes i have uh you you've seen that which was on there and the offices and in light of these uh hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed right they really don't have enough to keep them busy and keep their noses at in their own business and what they're doing and the other thing is uh right besides that i think uh two things that very definitely need looking at one is foreign aid i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget right uh again being just a voter voter and a taxpayer you know working through our congressman i don't think there's too much that i'm gonna be able to do about it but i believe in taking an active part in politics so yeah well i one one thing that really bothers me beyond beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes and the um regular normal taxpayers are you know paying such a large proportion of of our personal income and then the uh corporate um-hum yeah industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally right i think that that would would help a lot i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things but i don't know it's just hard to hard to take um you know see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use um-hum and uh seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from from that direction yeah they don't they don't seem to well but i really think the biggest problem and then the Taft Rudman Act is supposed to help that the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing yeah i mean this nonsense that's coming through now about uh uh lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to to boost the economy because people have no more money is it's it it's ridiculous yeah if they don't have that money now bringing in less is not gonna help the problem as far as the government not not gonna help it's never never helped my my personal situation i i can't say it would help theirs either no yeah and thank God we don't operate our budget the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in in dire trouble we're we're being serious but that's uh yeah i don't know what we're gonna be able to do about it but i guess it's been around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages i don't ever expect to pay mine off before i die so i guess why should the government try oh isn't that's the way they're thinking these days anyway it seems seems to be i you know i it really does bother me when i think about you know leaving our children with with this sort of uh a national problem that we can't seem to find an an answer to it i i don't know i i don't think it ever will really i maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense right really if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic you know intergovernmental intergovernmental or inter-United States type programs that i wouldn't really mind i yeah i believe in paying my share and i don't mind uh paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to but i just i just sometimes feel like i'm being used but uh again i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it so well that that's quite possible i guess we have to have to keep plugging away a little bit or it'll just totally get even more out of control but i i don't know yeah bite the bullet it sounds like you have a baby there yeah i i do she's a we're not feeling too well over here so that yeah yeah oh really oh that's a shame she's not the one going to Washington huh no no she's i don't think i could part with her oh okay okay Jerry okay we've probably been on long enough they didn't cut us off but i think that'll probably do it so it was nice talking to you okay well thanks bye bye okeydoke bye-bye  okay Diane and a very good afternoon to you and afternoon good afternoon to you do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them um no i do most of my cooking at home and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party ah my goodness well what would you uh like to cook what's what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party now you're in Dallas is it um uh right i'm in Dallas of course um dinner parties down here probably okay oh turn out to be more things like barbecues and i was i was thinking in terms of Mexican almost Tex-Mex Tex-Mex uh-huh yes yeah uh Tex-Mex Tex-Mex uh Mexican food um um-hum probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party well that's a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes that's the type of foods i like to find we have uh um-hum right i think Chico's or or these different restaurants in this area that uh have all those fine Mexican foods but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party um-hum uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken fried chicken but i would have fried chicken um with reasonably hot sauce on it almost a Mexican type thing um-hum and i love twice cooked potatoes have you ever had twice cooked potatoes oh yes i have with with the cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh little oleo and i use uh oregano and maybe dill weed on mixed in with it uh-huh right and uh i like broccoli casseroles um-hum which would include onion and cheese and again more dill weed and some medium hot peppers as you can see i'm inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal um-hum right and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too um-hum so uh how would you improve upon that improve upon that let's see i'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in more fresh vegetables included to that and some yeah uh green beans and um carrots and things like that uh-huh how do you cook your green beans my green beans um i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes um-hum so you and i like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them all right that's what i was wondering about what what you use and and and herbs and so forth uh-huh right uh-huh um i like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there and it makes them pretty tasty um-hum have you ever tried Chinese type green beans the Chinese type are they the real we use soy sauce no i haven't ever used that well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the water and um um-hum golly what's this white powder that that uh that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce and i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment a white powder um gosh anyhow sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have the nice soy sauce taste under it that's okay um-hum with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans um-hum yeah i like i like it to try them differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice um-hum just so i can enjoy them so you might uh think about that Chinese yeah i might try that Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them oh yes i love Chinese and uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous North African uh-huh and that's uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious dish you probably probably have to buy that from specialty stores um-hum C O U S C O U S and that's a a north African dish they eat it one to two meals every day in North Africa hm and it is very very flexible you can do a lot of things with it makes a fantastic uh uh salad with cucumbers and olive oil and onions and oh boy real tasty uh-huh well i've enjoyed talking with you and i hope i've given you some ideas and uh well i've enjoyed talking with you that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food oh yes well thank you very much Miss Diane okay thank you bye-bye bye-bye  uh all right Carolyn do you are you reading the papers about the the Middle East summit uh some yes i'm just a little bit too i think um i think i was worn out worn out from Middle East after the war yeah i think it kind of uh it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war um-hum but uh we definitely need something there with all the hostages and yeah yeah what that's i think uh i don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back i think that's really uh what all um-hum really important i i i can't i guess we grew up in such a different world i could never even imagine taking hostages yeah but i think they just have a whole different world than we do so i don't know but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be oh well you know i just see this Middle East situation with with Russia and everything there that's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down and i see the Middle East as being you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak um yeah so i guess i view view it as being the prime importance as far as um-hum trying to negotiate trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there yeah i think um i don't know i have uh i just have this this civil rights mentality i i guess you know should we or or you know should should we uh those i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do um-hum and i guess that's what i i hope for them but some of them don't want those freedoms i think their their religious beliefs may um may not you know they may not want it as a whole so i think that's something that has to be considered too but i think that's a that's really a long term yeah type thing i don't know the the it said think about long term repercussions and i was just thinking well peace is peace you know and that's really is the nicest thing um-hum i guess the question in my mind somewhat and and it depends on the country you know i think some are more peaceful than others um-hum yeah if you look at um Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the UN going in there and the the yeah um-hum bomb development and all this kind of stuff you know uh gosh i think you know we should have got him while we could yeah yes i i think so i think um or whatever and i think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East you know that's this constant fighting you know and right i think i think they realized we would probably never push him out and uh i think the other probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out because yeah i think they they look at force as a way of um-hum you you know their their means to their ends yeah yep and um so i you know i don't know so much if these peace talks are gonna i don't know how much they'll stay to them you know if even if we say that we're going to do stuff i don't know how they'll stick to that um-hum yeah i i think the the thing is though i i guess the the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas ideas that that coincide with the the US ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union um-hum and i guess that's all gone i think that's really uh probably what started the whole process i uh-huh well that's probably a bonus on our part yeah yes it is i think i think that they're so they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support um-hum from the Soviet Union so i guess they're saying well you know we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries from two ways we can either act like we're gonna be pro communist or act like we're going to be pro uh pro democracy and whatever gets us the most out of it that's what we'll act like we're going to do but we really won't change in the long run i think that's the way i sort of see them all working you know yeah i tend to agree with you you know i think they have in mind what they want to do and i think yeah a lot of times their slogan is might makes right um-hum and you know it kind of the forceful you know i don't know i i just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds yeah it's it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis i always find it very hard in my heart to align to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs you know but then again they have to live in that environment they have to be subjected to uh-huh all of the Arab bombings and terrorist attacks and whatever and they have to negotiate yeah almost everything and then you think to yourself well you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in then you have to sort of like i don't know logically  okay we're talking about capital punishment right how do you feel about that Lenore i am very much for capital punishment well wonderful i am too one hundred percent my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus and i've been raised around um-hum prison prisons all my life and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime there's not any deterrent all your life huh uh-huh there's no deterrent that's right there's just no deterrent that's right and so many of those kind of people uh they got they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway so you know unless they really make it rough on them that's not a going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think especially not a federal prison right well i don't know what the Oklahoma's laws are but Texas is i don't know our i don't know it's it's no ones fault i mean it's not the judges fault i don't think it's just the way the law is down here man our crimes our uh prisons are so crowded that uh they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two well see we were under uh the state prisons were under a mandate to uh it was over crowded and the federal came in and said hey you know you have either got to build more prisons or let people go well that's what ours did same thing and finally our governor at the time which who is not in office now came in and said okay where we draw the line is no sex offenders will be let loose under early bail you know or early uh out but uh we have uh-huh uh-huh um-hum um-hum um-hum the death penalty is not given often um-hum but there have been it's not here either really and you know i maybe it should be uh well it should be given you know i i won't say sparingly but i do believe it should be befitting the crime i do too and and you know but the way the courts are set up they've they've got so many chances for appeal but i think that i think it needs to be expedited you know if they've been convicted and given them appeal and they're still convicted of of a crime that's deserving of of a lethal injection let's do it and not waste so many years to do it right course you know they're they're entitled to a speedy trial that's right but then they're they're also entitled to drag it through the courts for years and years and years on appeals so somehow you know it doesn't really balance out too much um-hum um-hum yeah that's right somehow it just doesn't it works and then again it takes too long for it to work and it seems even though you know that they got the prisoner himself can come to the point that hey i'm tired i just want out um-hum you know i'm tired of fighting it then the system just keeps on um-hum um-hum yeah and at that point you know i i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter yeah it it was appeal process i do too i think that needs to and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably but you know well part of that is the overcrowding of the court system yeah that's true it is overcrowded because there's so much drug uh problem with the people on drugs because that they with the drugs they're they're robbing and killing and uh that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think uh it doesn't it doesn't help them any at all and course your court system when you get into the appeals no it doesn't i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there yeah that's true with all these lawsuits and people suing people over things ridiculous things but we've gotten into a very litigious uh type of life boy haven't that we though we really have but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment i'm i'm very muchly for it always have been always will be well i just i just feel like their crime and punishment and if if you don't have the punishment you double your crime and that you know that is just personal feeling it's not going on facts i think the facts would probably back it up but it could be supportive it it's it's supported with facts though what it could very easily be supported with facts well yes i  well uh and that's an idea that's been around for kicked around for a long time i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered uh as far as close to passing uh any legislation or anything like that but i believe Israel does that don't they for their uh yes i think so uh people in the well everybody has to do has to do something or maybe maybe theirs is in fact one year of military service for everyone but uh yeah i don't know yeah i believe that's right okay and uh and i don't know that that's really what we're talking about uh no i don't think it's it's necessary no i think of that it it it couldn't be military service is not that much but military used to do it but the idea that uh there are things that that do need to be done that could be done and then uh country would benefit from one year from from everybody and even out the the yeah yeah for for kids in high school it could be in the summertime requirement well now that's a thought yeah uh you know um it it could even be done while they're doing another job while they're doing you know a job to make money yeah but uh it's uh you know such a grassroots idea that it it i think the family would have to be involved in it and and people would have to be convinced that um-hum you know i i think the the basic message is that giving is better than receiving yeah right and that's not the kind of society we have right now oh yeah i'm afraid you're right there but uh but uh anything like this it came up whether it it quickly would be significant industry in in figuring out how to get around it where yeah there are lots and lots of volunteer programs and um people who didn't wanna yeah but most of those are at least at least it it's my opinion that most of those involve uh adults um-hum adults who have the time to give and and uh you know the desire um-hum to to give yeah it's not uh you know it's not uh maybe the maybe it could uh younger people feel like it's not open to them i don't know but but it should be if it's not yeah uh i suspect that the yeah that that that that's not the thing that they that they don't feel it's open to them it's just that they uh are more self-centered if you will and not not considering voluntary preference yeah it is kind of an introspective time of life but some schools some high schools have actually started a program of like a visitation program to yeah uh you know areas economically uh um-hum say less advantaged areas and uh um-hum they they promote service on the part of the kids to to uh some of those people so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess yeah yeah at uh now i didn't i don't know it did i i think you're right that that that's not the not the way that the society these days is going and i i think we need to we need to try to figure out some way to to turn that around that everybody yeah it's really it's really unfortunate because when you do i do volunteer work for the American Lung Association hm and i have have done uh gone to work for American Heart and just recently for the Leukemia Society and there's there's no question that doing you know doing that kind of service you get a lot more out of it than uh than the people involved yeah uh it's it's really a gift to yourself and and that's i think that's a really a really important lesson to learn yeah and and and maybe that's why we have so many people in society who are not uh not really happy you know or that could be because if if you concentrate all of your energies and efforts on yourself you're just kind of down the tube you know yeah right uh really is better to give then to receive yeah i agree i agree with that and uh and i'd i'd i don't know what what what has what has set it off or what but it it it certainly seems to me that that uh uh things in in the last twenty thirty years uh things things have have definitely gone towards uh very much the concentration on self and and and loss of loss of perspective in terms  uh so what have you seen recently well let's see why don't you start i'm trying to remember okay i've seen uh oh Necessary Roughness uh-huh that was filmed in Denton uh-huh uh have you seen that one no it's pretty good i really enjoyed that one uh-huh um let's see i just rented um we watched um let's see uh let's see i guess one of the last ones i saw that i really enjoyed was Ghost yes wasn't that a good movie that was great i really liked that one yeah but i like um oh who's the lead in that Swayze i think he's a good actor Swayze yeah yeah Patrick Swayze yeah we have a and personal acquaintance with oh you do his mother oh really she's a dance instructor over here not an instructor so much she choreographed a some of his movies oh really um would that would be wonderful Patrick Swayze yeah uh and uh he that one he has out recently that Point Break i haven't seen it but they said it's really good yeah i haven't seen it i haven't seen it we rented um oh what was that movie about the rock star and i can't remember what it was now huh hey Gayle um boy and i can't remember now um what was one of Patrick Swayze's last movies getting a little help here i can't remember what that one is um but uh The Doors Point Break oh yeah that's the one he's in now and that's suppose to be great yeah yeah and then um but i've also rented The Doors with um that story about the Morrison um-hum and uh i didn't see that or hear any of that that is weird i mean i i couldn't understand it i guess it was real tough to understand well i let's see i just uh feel obliged to make a comment that the uh i think the movies have too much violence in them these days i do too i do too um they're unreal i mean it's it's almost too much and and they wonder oh gee i wonder where all this crime is coming from yeah and it's like no we're not provoking it no huh-uh and and it's even what what kills me even more is what we've allowed to go over the television um-hum you know movies are one thing where there is some type of rating yeah but TV is out of control as far as i'm concerned yep it seems that way yeah you know i pretty soon we're going to use every word in the English language on the television and everything else but um-hum yeah that's the truth um one of the movies i'm i just moved here from South Dakota oh really and uh Dances with Wolves was filmed out by where i that's one of the just the one i was just fixing to say was Dances with Wolves yeah and that's where we lived yeah in Pierre and uh yeah you liked that i suppose that would be one i would expect you would like yeah yeah but um my father-in-law flies and he flew us over the like the buffalo ranch and everything where they you know took them heat there is a herd of buffalo yeah that they used for that and um that was quite a long movie but it was good yeah yeah it was that was uh it really was interesting from the historical standpoint um-hum yeah the the hardest part with that is that it was very you know good from a historical part of it but to you know for now there was a lot of um discrimination feelings coming back out yeah you know living up there with you know the tribes and things like that it started to come back it started to surface again yeah you heard about them going to rename or uh talking about renaming the which was kind of a the that park up there where the uh Little Big Horn was fought uh-huh yeah they were going to rename that to oh now i can't remember it was Custer's Custer yep and now they're going to rename it Little Big Horn and now yeah yeah that's a good idea yeah that whole thing kind of did that and then of course i always watch Julia Roberts' movies pardon i always watch the Julia Roberts' movies Julia Roberts yeah like Pretty Woman and hum um-hum i think Flatliners i really enjoyed i don't think i see i see did i no my wife was watching that i saw little glimpses of it see and i that was really good that was that was weird yeah you know for to to see if you know the person's description of that yeah oh that was where they uh these like researchers were yeah they were trying to see if they could put them to death and then bring them back right they were like five medical students yeah right and he they would put them into death for thirty seconds or whatever and they'd come back out and see how close they could get um-hum and when they'd come back out they'd bring their sins with them and they had to oh i never did see that part i just saw the first part and they had to settle their sins because they brought them back with them it was really weird but it was  so what do you think about it well i found it interesting that they started off with a problems of immigration in America and then went back and said well if there is a problem what should we do about it right yeah i guess that's so do you feel there's a problem with immigration in America um uh i think there are some problems but they're not really big ones i think that um in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be that it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here like even if they're educated and will be a good asset to America it's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that okay that's interesting i was i was wondering what your response would be i'm a first generation American okay uh where did you come from so i'm from immigrant parents or an immigrant mother anyway okay okay so where did your parents come from uh Poland okay and that was you know prior to World War Two and um-hum but it's interesting that you know with the topic i think i agree with you there needs to be more of an open policy yeah um-hum and you know we have to remember the Chinese came here and were our labor you know for the railroad Transatlantic Railroad and yep our Irish came and you know built the towns and did labor um-hum but what do you think are you from Texas or i'm from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania okay well that'll be interesting yeah right and um a lot of because we have just had a naturalization act where the Mexicans that were residents in Texas i'm from Texas um-hum and have become citizens now yeah what do you think about that um i think that's all right i um at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing do you have an opinion about it well i agree with it wholeheartedly the only thing is i've got to share with you and my background is from New Jersey uh-huh uh-huh so when you were giving your answer i was thinking is this a Texan i'm talking to because Texan philosophy is a little different no okay right well a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brother-in-law who's Chinese and immigrated from China and um you know he um got a green card is and is in good standing in America and in China but only because he was always pretty nice to the Chinese government um-hum and all that and he was always on pretty good terms with them yeah well we but um their my sister just had a baby and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to America to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem it's just very difficult to get a a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of China even temporarily to visit here oh well then you have first in the experience on immigration yeah well that is interesting um-hum yeah well i well i wonder you know even with those that were involved with Tiananmen Square you know did we really protect them right yeah that's and i think that's pretty crazy because yeah i mean those students who were in America when that was happening are almost certainly going to be in trouble if they go back and besides that they're the best and brightest of China so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can that is true that is true yep well what do you think about we have in Texas a large Vietnamese population um-hum that has been brought in yeah what do you think about that um and these are not the brightest i mean we see these are refugees you mean okay we're talking boat people right okay we have a lot of boat people in Texas right well um i don't have any problem with that um you're a true liberal heart-to-heart good for you i was ready for a fight on this one yeah i guess so uh-huh right um-hum no i agree because um interesting my when my daughter was in high school one of the custodians was Vietnamese yeah and with his limited English they found out through you know that she was in student council and they found out that he was a medical doctor  hi so uh what was the last car repair you had just recently i was kind of laughing when i when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because uh i had to have my uh radiator flushed oh and it was getting rusty and the thing that they forgot to do was to um to also look at the hose and i had gone about oh two days with my new radiator flushed and the hose burst so i was stranded out on the highway oh no did you crack the block or what no i i i didn't do that thank goodness but um there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there you know left to do that but it cost me all kind of money you know to have that repaired after they said they were gonna they had repaired it t so that was that was a horrible experience just recently yeah i'll see you got lucky didn't ruin the whole engine though that can be pretty serious yes yes i know i know what about you oh i guess it's been awhile for me i'd say it's been about a year uh-huh yeah i had the uh the water pump break on my car oh yeah i was traveling uh i was going on my way home from Thanksgiving and it broke like in the middle of nowhere um-hum uh-huh so i had to get it towed and then fixed and big pain uh-huh oh oh i know i know especially what if you're out on the highway yeah that's where i was luckily someone came by and gave me a ride um-hum um-hum i know well you know i uh living in Dallas you know we've got uh bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic and uh that was that was horrible yeah you know to have the you know your car is fuming and everything it's already a hundred degrees you don't need that too oh shoot but my car is getting old see it's about six years old now so yeah so is mine yeah so i got it right out of college and so it's uh it's starting to show that wear and tear now yeah i'm hoping mine gets me through i got until May till i'm out so if my car lasts that long i'll be okay uh-huh uh-huh yeah that uh that was my graduation present to myself so yeah yeah i know so but gosh it's really starting to to wear so i've been thinking especially now is a good time to buy a car oh that's nice yeah gonna because i can't uh i don't know if i wanna you know pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown yeah i don't wanna do too much on mine because it'll be worth more than the car and that it it's not worth it um-hum um-hum yeah that's true i agree with you there so i don't know uh because i i need to have it tuned you know tuned up and i don't know replace some of the belts and i was looking at the uh yeah tires need to be replaced and so i was thinking gee that's a lot of money i'm might as well buy me a new car for that yeah i got new tires last winter too so i'm like that's the last major purchase for this thing it's not worth it uh-huh well you have to Pennsylvania boy you have to really have your car winterized and stuff huh yeah yeah we get some killer winters up here in the mountains um-hum oh really oh okay so yeah lot of snow and a lot of cold uh-huh well especially don't you have what a lot of salt on the ground yeah at times there's a lot of it you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance uh-huh yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh yeah i haven't had a big problem with that though uh-huh so i've been pretty lucky there well i think they got the new Z Bart stuff and everything to where you can um yeah that's for usually pretty good you just rinse it off after the winter's over and done with it uh-huh yeah and go like that so yeah i usually like to do most repairs on my own though do you yeah just because that way i know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't uh-huh uh-huh yeah plus if something goes wrong i'll know who to blame well i i think i'm getting too old for all that my uh i had four brothers and they used to drag me out underneath the car and stuff so i can i can do all that stuff but i i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty two ninety five to to go and have it done now so i can get my hands dirty so yeah i'm just getting getting to that age i guess you just don't have your time becomes very precious so working on the car is just not one of those things i wanna spend my time on anymore more fun things to do absolutely absolutely so yeah trying to you know i just need one i had two cars there for a while so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was gonna run well that's nice and yeah so but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them and yeah so that yeah one's bad enough yes one was bad enough but i think i got rid of the wrong one i soon i need a lot of repairs done on on this one so yeah that was uh that was something else whenever our five minutes up i i didn't i didn't set the time or anything to uh yeah put yeah i was just wondering that yeah i didn't either yeah this must be a a hard category well yeah i guess um you know unless you're um you know big do-it-yourselfer um to you know fix up your own cars and and things like that so but i guess they they were talking about experiences you know i uh uh i did my parents live in Ohio so i i do know something about the you know the really cold weather and uh i've always lived down here in the South and i went i took my car up there to their house and um i guess i had a crack in the block and when i got up there the car  i'm ready okay you have an opinion about civil stuff well you know when to me when you're talking about juries there's there's two types of juries you've got the civil juries and then you've got the criminal juries now the criminal juries right my understanding of those where a person has done some crime and you're trying to determine that they need to go to jail or not and then if he does for how long the civil jury does it matter of um-hum you owe me some money or you think that i owe you some money and we can't get it resolved so we go to the jury and we're ask we're gonna ask that jury to uh make a decision as to who owes who and for how much yes i'm sorry i have a problem with that oh i do too because first of all i'm a working person and i need to get paid for my day of work and if the our juries only pay us seven dollars and fifty cents for a full day of work i think it's wrong that two people have a dispute they had a little car wreck and maybe one owes the other guy five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars whatnot and they're going to call me away from work for seven dollars and fifty cents to make a decision as to who owes who and how much to me that is what we pay our judges to do okay you're you're you're self-employed so you're not i am self-employed that's right reimbursed by anyone i'm not going to be reimbursed by no one okay uh yeah that that's interesting point i i i'm not an enthusiast for juries particularly and i think especially in in civil cases i doubt doubt the effectiveness of it i hadn't thought about it from terms of the cost point of view to providing the jury i think we may be the only major country today that still uses juries in civil trials you know that one i've never heard of but that you may be right i was i wish i'd you know i've i've never heard that before i'm pretty sure Britain has has uh given up juries in civil cases but i mean isn't isn't that what we have the elected officials who supposedly is unbiased who can't aren't they supposed to have a head on their shoulders to make these decisions well probably judges would be the people you decision about whether to use juries or decision no decision as to whether or not as far as civil's concerned i mean i i i think it would be better to have them have judges trained professionals deciding such things true um i don't know there's any Constitutional way to do that other than to change the Constitution you're probably right but it that's still my as far as i'm concerned i just think it's wrong to use a jury for the civil matters now you can talk about criminal matters um-hum uh i've got no problem with that one because you know here you're talking about uh has a person fit into society has he followed the rules of society i've i've got no problem at all with using your peers quote quote and helping to make decisions although we'd have problems as to who qualifies to be on that uh jury and i think some of the the manipulative rules that they use to say that all the rich and famous cannot be on a jury but all the poor dregs can be you know it doesn't it doesn't make sense uh no i don't think i guess different states have different rules on that well it it it what amount to if you're if you're rich if you got money i and your really high on society somehow another you're going come up with a one of these excuse that the the the judge gonna say yeah you're excused you don't have to be here but if you are some poor old uh blue collar worker who you know uh just trying to eke out a living and uh i work from eight to five and you know for some reason he's not gonna find an excuse to get out and so we typically find our juries made up of some of the dumbest people rather than the smarter people this is because because of not who initially comes in but who's selected out of the panel uh okay certainly both sides right pick criteria by which they wanna wanna judge juries and and uh veto lots of those and i suspect that uh well see likely to get off that way although it it'll vary true um i mean i guess traditionally juries are supposed to do findings of fact as opposed to findings of law and deciding but then they but then they also have to make the decision as to how long that person should serve well that that varies by state and locality as to whether the okay and and there most juries don't even know what the hell they even talking about uh there is a little basis for comparison and then when you get someone who says okay this person should be convicted for thirty years two years later they're on probation because the jury doesn't know and in in the state of Texas i don't think you are allowed uh the jury's not allowed to be told how soon that person would be off on probation only thing that they can do is determine how long they should be put in jail not knowing what the rest of the rule is which i think is unfair well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges either  uh the the only work i do outside the home is i am an Avon representative oh okay and i sell Stanley products uh-huh and uh so i i don't really i don't really dress up a whole lot do you work outside she can well i i work um i'm a CPA and i do contract work oh uh-huh and so and i work with another CPA who just started his own practice and i work with him a couple days a week and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices then i'll dress up oh uh-huh um-hum but otherwise it's great being at home in jeans or shorts or whatever so that that makes it pretty nice it um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum it's kind of weird because before i used to work you know full time and and uh it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day just about well you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day i think yeah right right and so it's uh some of my suits i haven't put on for quite a while so it uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh it's kind of a nice to relax a little bit yeah it's it's very nice i yeah well my my dress up i live out in the country also so what i wear depends on the weather uh-huh sure uh so i really i know a lot of the Avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up but i mostly dress uh-huh i try to dress nice but for convenience because when the weather's bad when i go into the home i take off my shoes uh-huh which i try to wear something easy to take off you know and put on and i don't too often take off my coat even so right uh i really don't have to dress up like you you would like if you're in an office or something yeah yeah well i imagine that where you live uh you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year uh well not actually because we really only have maybe three four months of i'd say warm weather not really oh is that right yeah and the rest is uh gets into the cooler weather um-hum uh-huh course they keep saying the weather's gonna change or we're gonna have more Florida type weather up here so i don't know but for now uh-huh so y'all are waiting for that um-hum but even for now we have a lot of ice and snow in the wintertime and uh cold weather and that type of thing now my daughter works all the time so she dresses uh-huh yeah it i think you know you have to spend more money on your clothing and that because you do have to have the appearance a good appearance to do a good job right right where you work yeah well down here it's sunny most of the time and uh um-hum usually warm i mean we've had a few cool days uh this month but not anything i'm sure compared to what you've had so far so i mean people are still wearing shorts and um um-hum um-hum and uh usually around Halloween it starts getting cooler so you start you know breaking out a coat um-hum um-hum right yeah at that time but that that lasts you know for a few months did you find you wore uh slacks when you were working full time or did you did did they wear more dresses and skirts no no never wore slacks it was no slacks i think it was one of those things where it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them it was one of those understood things that you just you know either wore you know a dress or uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh not even a dressy slack a dressy suit slack suit even if it's all not no not not with what i did um most people didn't sometimes like the secretaries might uh-huh uh-huh um-hum but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much and i really you know there's some nice pantsuits out and and i wouldn't have minded minded you know wearing those especially when it gets pretty cold um-hum um-hum hm um-hum um-hum i know my daughter mostly i don't think she ever wears slacks slacks to work but i didn't know if the trend changes you know if uh but um uh-huh you know i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional i guess they expect women to be in skirts or dresses uh-huh uh-huh look more like a woman huh uh-huh uh-huh yeah that's right and it's the men that make the rules uh well then you you you know why they make them then that way but no we usually you know skirt and skirt and blouse or suit or dress is is what you see down here so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants um-hum um-hum yeah no one no one can see me unless i'm you know gonna yeah but yet you need to keep up an appearance for your husband too though at home but that's i i believe yeah yeah but i'm not gonna put a skirt on just for him oh you don't think you will huh well you'll be excused because considering everything huh uh-huh yeah i think that the main issue at home is being comfortable in your clothing yeah but i i look at homemaking as a job also uh being a homemaker and i i think sometimes we lose sight of that right yeah uh by the fact that we don't sometimes watch our dress  this is an easy easy subject i i guess i watch too much TV that's yeah i i watch a lot of television myself here lately i'm out of a job right now so watch a lot of lot of Jeopardy and cartoons do you afternoon shows mainly then yeah yeah my kids love to watch cartoons and i have to come in the other bedroom to watch Jeopardy and and such what are some of your favorite sitcoms or whatever at night um i like uh the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air yeah pretty good and uh generally the the channel eight stuff that comes on Doogie Howser and Roseanne and um-hum stuff like that um-hum you don't have a real favorite or a real favorite probably Fresh Prince or Married With Children they're your favorites huh they're pretty good oh it surprises me that yours aren't the same as mine and i thought i formed mine kind of with my husband so we've been MacGyver fans forever and i don't know if you ever watch that it's on Monday nights uh excuse me we we enjoy it mainly because it i think it has it's full of adventure and stuff like that yeah i i watch that when i can usually i i go out right around then so i'm not home then yeah and we used to like Cosby real well but it it's kind of slacked off a little bit it's not one of our yeah yeah Murphy Brown is always is good for several laughs we like that we watch Doogie quite often too yeah um-hum but the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty bad too so but uh we we watch and LA Law is another one we probably watch if we can yeah and Quantum Leap we have our our favorites of course i don't know what channel they're all on probably different ones that's kind of fun to watch too are you watching the World Series right now too or uh yes i am actually i it's the first year i've really been interested interested in baseball but i just decided to pay attention here to the the World Series i have a brother that lives in Minnesota so this kind of been fun to watch and they tried to get get tickets and man the scalpers that were out wanted a hundred and fifty per ticket yeah that's getting tickets for something like that it's like trying to i don't know enter Fort Knox yeah so i just read in today's paper where the Dynasty sequel um out rated the World Series that really surprised me yeah that's kind of strange i didn't think i didn't care to watch that Dynasty at all i guess it depends on if you're a Dynasty fan or not yeah and now and now Dynasty is again tonight and the World Series is back on again tonight it will be interesting to see how many keep with it yeah see if it was really that good or not but i think what it is is everybody excuse me everybody was looking to see the the fight between the the two women yeah yeah they look like that's pretty good that's a a friend of mine was taping it just so he could see this one fight and he taped the wrong day because it wasn't on the first day oh gee oh well so now he's got to tape tape it again today i think's when it comes back on i think i'll stick with the World Series let them fight it out i don't yeah i i never was much of a Dynasty fan no i i watched Dallas at first when it first came on and then i lost interest in it too yeah and Dynasty i just never did get into so but well i think that's all we need to discuss we have a few similar not too many and okay now i'll have to watch one of yours and see if i like it so all right it was good talking to you bye-bye okay thank you bye  okay well uh what what do you all do for camping well we don't do so much now but when uh i i was uh a child we went regular old camping tents and and everything like that and then with our children we did uh we had a pop-up tent camper uh-huh um-hum and we used that to go camping where do you go we uh years ago we lived in Oklahoma and we went to uh Lake Ardmore i mean Lake Murray all the time but when we did it with our children we lived in uh Tennessee and we went up into the Smokeys oh uh-huh oh which was just absolutely fantastic oh i bet it was around Gatlinburg or somewhere out in there uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and along the uh ooh there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee through uh Georgia and into Alabama and uh i think it was called the um-hum uh White Cloud or White Mountain and went up on it well now did you all sleep in sleeping bags and did it get real cold at night or it got real cold but the uh camper had uh beds in it you know when we had that one and uh so we just you know we had our bedding we didn't have to go with sleeping bags but the when i was a oh yeah uh teenager and growing up that was sleeping bags and joining blankets and sleeping on ledges or you know ground and uh that got kind of rough sometimes uh-huh uh-huh well we only did that once now since we've been married we just go um we go real often to Colorado to the mountains but we'll stay in cabins oh do you oh uh-huh and you know we call it going camping but we're really not but the one time that i did go camping when i was about i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family we drove to uh up by Cosa Cosa Springs Colorado and went about seventeen miles back in the back where you couldn't even get a forest ranger if you tried and to the the tent for a week oh uh-huh oh and at night it was so cold you thought you'd never feel your feet again and the smell and the stars were just five feet above you you know they were just right there and it was the most oh just beautiful bonding most wonderful time we enjoyed it but about the fourth day i thought if i don't get a hot tub and shave my legs i'm gonna die and i had yes yes i understand that i i i got enough of it right then so when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water i'm a little bit better off but yeah my husband and i he he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt and i i agree with him our children are are grown but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the TV i understand i agree with him too well that's true um-hum and the phone and we got just strictly by ourselves we uh some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us and you know and we could you know get back in touch with each other uh-huh well that that's and they can't believe that they could survive it and then once they're there they they think it's kind of cool oh i know i know oh they just you know they just thoroughly enjoy it you know or enjoyed it yeah yeah and we hiked we would hike all day and mom did the whole uh pork and beans and you know the slice slice the potatoes and fry them outside and all of the little stuff that we just were so amazed she knew how to do you know couldn't believe um-hum yes yes yes like i know that you know breakfast we would you know we'd have these big breakfast cooked over this little Coleman stove and oh yeah with bacon oh yeah yes and would just absolutely taste wonderful and and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast so we usually had a bite apiece one one yes or one yes yes but i know that we you know as a teenager growing up and going to Lake Murray there would be oh maybe twenty twenty five of us because it would be all of my mother's family you know and all my cousins and it oh my goodness well now is that hot camping is that where you're you're hot like on a beach i mean is that oh no no we were in the we were in the woods you know because a lot of our friends will well a lot of our friends in east Texas will go to east Texas in the summer and camp and i'm thinking how could you stand it you know just well we didn't notice it back then but that was back before air-conditioning was so prevalent you know prevalent and all yeah yeah yeah that's true we did a lot and uh you know and it it always rained on us i don't care what weekend we went and when it was it always rained on us but i like that and see especially in the tent every afternoon it would rain and you'd get your book and just kind of cuddle up and i thought that was fun uh-huh uh-huh cuddle up um-hum well i don't know i remember one time uh some cousins were in a tent and it was married cousins and they they had the tent and this you know frog strangler that we used to call him came through and they were had put their tent over kind of i don't know what it wasn't a creek bed it was like kind of like a little little uh gully or trench or something and the water rushed down and they said they looked down and there went Bud's boots you know there went several things floating down this water you know we just used to have balls you know uh-huh oh no oh no golly it was it was more fun you know and as i said it just rained every time and then my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller and we went up there but it was never quite the same thing you know well yeah well i yeah i understand that too because some of the places we in fact the the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit it loses it's flavor yes yes it does it really does um so well i've i've gotten in the mood to go now yeah yes yeah even i would kind of like to go and i know if i go home and say oh let's go camping my husband says you're crazy i enjoyed talking to you too thank you bye-bye i you're crazy well listen i enjoyed talking with you okay have a good day bye-bye  well let's see as far as i'm so so what gets you well the thing i think that annoys me the most is i have i have young children a baby in the house and and inevitably as soon as they're asleep someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something and i think that that is probably the most um-hum aggravating um it you know it invades my time i'm the one that pays for the phone um um-hum if i wanna buy something i'll take the initiative and and go find it you know and it that just really does aggravate me um what do you think well i mean i that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said although in my case it's my wife and i both work we come home and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings and it's one solicitation call after another and you know your time is is valuable and yeah it's it's like you say very annoying and um why why do we let this happen oh i that's that's interesting i uh uh the market seems to just be growing too i i guess enough people are not speaking out i'm not speaking out that's for sure i just get aggravated about it and would would you mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate i really don't know i'm i'm not into um heavy government legislating legislating of a lot of different areas but i i don't know i just i do particularly find it annoying um i really not sure i haven't given that a lot of thought if if it should should go you know to be yeah it it seems it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't wanna receive calls like that well that yeah that might and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare compare identify themselves yeah the their lists that they're gonna call against this list of people who don't wanna be called right that would be a an an interesting ways yeah um and that that way those who want it can have it and those who don't want it don't have to have it right sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers right just oh is that right oh well that's interesting um automatically and and they just get everybody huh oh boy bright well i i do wish that it would stop on my end because it it seems to happen at the worst possible moments yeah and i i guess the the next one is is door-to-door solicitors i don't mind the children when they're selling things for school i have kids and you know that's just kind of part of it but when um-hum yeah it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning um that really it just makes you not feel particularly safe and it's annoying as well um-hum yes and these and these people may in fact be just looking to steal find an unoccupied house to rob right you just you really don't know so i i find myself being a little a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than i might normally be but i i do feel like it's a an invasion of my space and uh um-hum yeah what about these telephone callers sometimes they're door-to-door but usually they're telephone callers who who want you to basically help them fill out a questionnaire i've never quite understood the purpose of that yeah i uh well i think these people are hired by from from different sources just to keep um with you know and so therefore there's no one answer but but yeah sometimes it's a market survey basically it's a market survey but they never say who who they're really working for or what you know what what what questions are you know just a survey yeah there've been a couple of times when the it the uh whatever the subject was i guess caught my interest and i went along with it and then there have been several times when i just said well i just really don't have the time yeah you know to deal with it at that moment yeah but um i don't get too many of those i've had just a few yeah um generally someone's trying to sell me something or yeah right well and sometimes that's this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too right right other times it's you know wasting your time to collect the data they want for their right with marketing purpose for which if they would just pay me enough money i would be willing to consider but but a dollar isn't it you know it's uh yeah that's right oh well and i also sort of worry that you know that sometimes people give away personal information um when when the call comes and and they uh uh you know sort of seductive to you know somebody's asking me my opinion on all of these things and so i start answering and then you you know you go down a path um right and you don't know where it's gonna end uh yeah in fact you don't even know what you've eventually you know the totality of what you've revealed and you know well we that's true this isn't you know probably most likely not to going to be used against you but it could and yeah you just never know i guess and that seems to be something that should should really be outlawed that yeah i i because it's subject to abuse and it asking for information is is i can't really see that i think they ought to if if if if nothing else they ought to spend money for a postage stamp and you know when it arrives at your house oh i  so what kind of music do you like i like um a wide variety like programmed into my radio my car radio i have any everything everything from like soul yeah to uh like some easy listening i have the Edge on there um-hum uh where do you live um New Wave oh Dallas okay i'm from Pennsylvania where are you from okay then you wouldn't know what the Edge is it's kind of like new not punk or anything but just new age New Wave or whatever how about you right exactly okay um well i like a lot of folk music and jazz and different sorts of experimental music um-hum like New Age um yeah some stuff that you could call New Age let's see i like uh Cherry Riley a lot um-hum um-hum i don't know who that is and okay uh let's see well who do you like from that category yeah say from New Age well i was talking about like New Wave or uh-huh um-hum uh New Wave all right okay well who do you like like that i mean oh God i don't know anybody's name um um uh-huh like Peter Murphy or um okay yeah i'm not i'm not that crazy about the Bauhaus um i liked Joy Division a lot and trying to think what else Simple Minds um-hum um-hum you probably know a lot more about music than i do i just listen to it while i'm driving basically uh i don't even have a stereo at the moment oh oh maybe right um-hum oh how horrible how how can you live like that um so uh-huh um-hum it's pretty hard right um let's see and um but soul you know i like everybody um don't die but i like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer and um um the Jacksons Michael um-hum right okay um-hum yes i think Terrance right least the Jacksons i can agree with you Terence Trent D'Arby uh uh um-hum yeah you like stuff like Prince just everybody yeah i like him except for his latest song Cream i could live without and his what his latest song Cream i could live without okay uh let's see yeah i think i heard that but like Purple Rain i liked once i like what i've heard of the new album huh his uh i like his old stuff uh like what um Purple Rain um-hum i have that tape um yeah well that's very good have you heard uh Dirty Mind um-hum hum-um i don't think so oh that's a that's a fantastic album it's even hm earlier it's one of those where he's playing all the instruments and it's uh actually pretty brilliant a lot of it's uh like the dirty side of his stuff hm um-hum um-hum but that's all right too yeah he's always been kind of a pervert um-hum which is weird because it's like on one hand he's so religious and then on the other hand he's such a big pervert you know kind of ironic right well yeah well i think that kind of happens for a lot of artists i mean you could say the same sort of thing about um-hum Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis or something or well Jimmy Swaggert he's in he's a singer um-hum um-hum that's true um-hum they abuse their power uh right uh and no it seems that a lot of people a lot of Christians seem to sort of walk the line between uh hm um-hum hm you know total depravity and um-hum you know and religion and asceticism you know hm hm how old are you what how old are you i'm twenty uh uh six oh okay yeah you use a lot of big vocabulary words i was just wondering uh oh well um hm what's your major acoustics oh right i was thinking English or something okay yeah no i'm in engineering basically hm hm but i'm very interested in music anyway i play some stuff and i'm a radio DJ and blah blah blah um-hum oh neat hm how did you get into that um well just i worked for a radio station as an undergraduate just the college radio station and had um-hum um-hum where where'd you go to school had to Goshen College which is in Indiana hm hm and i found it to be a very good experience i mean besides having access to millions of records i liked being able to control the airwaves you know um-hum um-hum um-hum and so now i'm just working for the campus radio station at Penn State where i am neat neat so no wonder you know so much about music okay oh well um let's see we're really supposed to talk about that then um um-hum oh it really doesn't matter to tell you the truth  now we're ready do you have a personal computer we have one you do in your home yes yes ma'am i do not have one in my home i use one all day at work but i don't have one at home what do you find you use it a lot do you wish you i don't use it as much as my children and my husband do my actually my husband and i are taking a class at our local junior college um-hum called Microcomputers Microcomputers 101 and we're just touching on database spreadsheets and word processing and just kind of you know different kinds of storage and we're just kind of touching on a basic computers um-hum um-hum what kind do you have we have an IBM compatible it's Gateway brand um-hum that we bought mainly for our children to have educational programs um-hum well that sounds interesting yeah what kind of a computer do you use at work i i have a a PS 1 IBM type uh-huh uh and i use it all day at work and i put all my personal stuff on it at work uh-huh so i really don't haven't had a need for one at home but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work i'd want one at home right i worked on my airline Apollo Focal Point computer for about four years um-hum it which was different yeah what is that tracing tracking the flights and things but i missed right right how long are we supposed to talk on this uh-huh they tell us when we're through oh okay okay this is they come in and tell us have you just started doing this this is my very first time yes oh really they'll come in and tell us that the switchboard is full now and it's time for you to wind up in the next thirty seconds or something like that oh okay it's not more than five minutes but i'm going to ignore that that's a call on my other line so i'm just gonna ignore it but uh oh oh okay oh okay that i have that too it's kind of a hassle when you have this but other times i it where where do you work i work at Texas Instruments oh you do oh well of course of course that's why you why you're making these calls right yes i sure do well no i'm doing this at home i'm already home for the day oh i see well this is a pretty good deal i do it uh you know i can't do it at work i i'm i work in the legal department so i'm pretty busy uh-huh but i use my PC there mostly for creating legal documents we use WordPerfect Lotus uh-huh oh you do know Lotus huh oh that's great that's something we want to learn um yeah it's really i love Lotus i think that's about my favorite oh i've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it um-hum that's great it really is and i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it uh-huh but uh you know you learn something every time you use it i have a question on this this thing that i'm this survey or whatever you know this i volunteered for um-hum do i start calling in myself or do i wait for people to call me you can did they give you a number to call right an eight hundred number you can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only make one call a day oh only one a day yeah if you've talked to someone like you're talking to me now and i place the call this counts as your call right so you cannot make a call now until tomorrow oh oh i see okay so then do you get the five bucks or do i no we both do oh we both do well that's a heck of a deal didn't they ask you for your ID number when you answered okay so you both do from what i understand right i had to put that in well that's a pretty good deal so why why are we doing this it's for research actually i'm doing this for somebody else but you know for a fund-raiser it's a research type project on uh voice activated electronics you know to uh it's uh well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up uh-huh oh it's almost like that like a voice command computer type thing oh um-hum um-hum they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this now i don't know well that's wonderful i don't know everything about it but they uh try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this and that way they can check voice patterns i see different kinds of voices and um-hum and get the computer where it recognizes voices things wonderful see that's why i it's interesting because you have i i'm going to say you have an accent well i probably do since i've and i and i think that i don't i mean to you but you know well i've been born i was born and raised in Texas have lived here forever so i probably do and you're in what city i'm in Richardson it's right outside of Dallas okay my sister one of my sisters lives in Plano uh-huh well Richardson's right between Dallas and Plano is that right outside of how about that i probably went through Richardson then you probably did and then i have a sister that lives in Austin um-hum well what are you doing way in Washington but there both well we're actually all from Nebraska they just are recently moved there my brother-in-law is director of admissions at the University of Texas in Dallas um-hum well that's interesting yeah and then my sister works at the air force base uh-huh so i imagine they use personal computers actually yes they both have personal computers do they do their correspondence on it uh i think they just send Christmas letters on it as far as i mostly my one sister uses hers for uh-huh her children you know children's games um-hum  credit cards is one of my wonderful topics um do you have quite a few or i got rid of mine about uh oh it's been about four years ago now okay and uh went on a strictly cash basis uh-huh and uh sometimes it's inconvenient but uh-huh it is so much better for me it is because i i am the type that will always find an emergency oh me too but i have found that there were so many things that with a credit card you know i really did need uh-huh and with cash once you know it took me probably two years to get on a cash basis when i stopped charging um-hum but once once i did you know it it only takes me two or three months to be able to save up what i want to buy um-hum and i'm not paying the high interest rates that's what kills you on those credit cards because it's so easy you know you have these wonderful intentions of well i'll just pay off the whole balance and then i won't owe any uh-huh and then something comes up you know and well i'll just pay the minimum well you just do that forever um-hum oh and and with the interest charge on the credit cards you're not getting anywhere because you're paying your interest every month and that's all you're doing no you're paying interest and with our Visa that's really high interest we're in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards so that somehow we can get ahead on that but you know i've i've thought about going ahead and getting something like American Express where you have to pay within thirty days yes yes pay the balance at the end of the month um-hum right and just for ID purposes um-hum but it's become such a way of life oh it has and like i say it was so convenient and then pretty soon you get a consolidation loan um-hum to consolidate all your credit cards and then they send you another credit card um-hum they i know like you paid that one off now here's another when really you're paying a loan for the other one uh right so i i just finally figured out that for my way of life i did much better and i've i've been able to buy as much or more um-hum by just going cash and like i say it was tough because it's a really it's a habit um-hum it is because you think oh i'll get this and just pay it off later or you know you'll think okay i've got x amounts to spend this month and then somebody has a birthday or get they get married or something um-hum you think well i'll just put this one thing on it well you don't do that once you start you know you're going to have a bill coming in anyway uh-huh no um-hum might as well just yeah like you said there's a lot of things that i could probably do without that i don't do without because i have the credit card right you know and uh and i i just you know for for me it was a trap that was too easy for me to get into uh-huh yeah uh my husband and i just moved from South Dakota to um Plano Texas and uh that was the thing that helped helped us get down here and that's what we're trying to get down on that because the credit card helped us move because we had just graduated from college and we felt that there was a lot of more opportunity down here and so it helped us out with the moving expenses uh-huh but um now we're in the process of trying to get that down too but it it did help in that kind of a situation but um well you know there are times when you know it is but i i've been laid off twice in the last four years and had i had a lot of credit cards oh really you're you're stuck i would well you know it it really helped that i didn't have that to pay for but in the other vein had i had them i would have lived on them right um-hum yeah because you didn't have any other income right yep and uh this way you know i i made do um-hum and uh when i was you know employed then i didn't have all that that i had to go back and say well i've got ten thousand dollars worth of credit cards to pay off now right and that that's good that's a good feeling not to know it really you know with the first like i say it took me over two years to pay mine off but the first time you know that i could go out and make a major purchase uh-huh uh-huh and pay cash and pay cash it was a real good feeling i bet  one of the hardest things in finding child care is deciding to let go what do you think now what do you mean by letting go well like going back to work and uh it seems like parents have a very difficult time especially mothers have a very difficult time in uh finding someone well first off in going back to work they uh with the little babies and then then finding someone that satisfies them um-hum right right well um gosh my kids are older now so i feel like that that my uh choices are are different now when i first um-hum yes when i first went back to work uh you're right i i wanted to have somebody who came into the house and who performed you know certain functions and that closeness and i noticed that as the older they got um-hum you know the less and less picky i got about that um uh that criteria um-hum uh but you know now uh you know i wish there was somebody not so much to babysit the kids but tutor them in homework really really so but oh yeah and help help with the housework a little bit the the best one i ever had was uh when i had only one child and uh was an infant and it was an older woman and she came to the house and uh she had noon meal cooked and my husband and i came home and ate and everything um-hum oh see that would've been wonderful well of course it was extra special for us because he was a student and i had to work so uh that really helped um-hum uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah yeah yeah those uh those people who can uh stay you know home and and take care of the kids and uh you know do that i think are really special people um-hum um so you just don't find that anymore um even now the the day cares though are so expensive oh yes that um i don't know how parents afford them uh i don't either well a lot of mothers have had to quit work because of that right right you get one or two children one child and could be fifty to seventy five dollars a week oh yeah i and then you get two and it just multiplies um-hum yeah i i think it's gone up to like a hundred dollars a week and depending on on what age they are oh yeah and uh you know if you want quality day care to where they have uh not only just their meals taken care of those basic necessities but also uh their education too that's true study time and uh if they watch television it's educational only or you know monitor that don't just turn them loose on it um-hum because um-hum oh yeah oh yeah so it's a i i think it's changed over the years um but you know i found uh like i said they at least when my kids were growing up that uh it was harder especially companies didn't have programs to where they would help you find babysitters yeah oh no huh-uh you found someone in the neighborhood if you were lucky yeah um-hum that's right that's right and um-hum it have you had any experience with people who have chosen nannies no no but you know i've read um you know some stories uh about that and uh so now now i don't do you know of anybody um-hum well i'm i do the kind kind of work we we do medical checkups on some who are going to be nannies and the criteria they're using are they want they they require them to have certain blood tests and um-hum um-hum as well as their educational requirements and um-hum the one nannies i've talked to who bring the children in are very very uh oh enthusiastic about what they're doing with them and um-hum um-hum um they present themselves well but that's as as close as i've come to them yeah yeah no i had just you know read in a uh oh i don't know the the want columns um but i guess when i had thought about it since i've been a single parent for so long that uh you know i wished i had the money for something like that um-hum um-hum oh yes because of the special um oh i don't know the um the special closeness that bond that's formed versus taking them to a day care where they just they're one of many children right yeah so that's a that's to me it's extra special well the only i think the one good thing about day care of course i'm in the grandchildren age and one of my grandchildren needed the day care because he needed to the other um-hum uh other uh younger children he needed to learn to share sure sure he was uh his mother couldn't get two feet from him right right and uh they're hoping that that helps on that course that may be just the age yeah it it could be age but you know i i can never regwet regret uh the children uh going through that day care experience because they learned so many things uh such as responsibility independence um-hum um-hum uh you know that sharing i mean there are a lot of good things i i know there's a lot of drawbacks to women going back to to work um-hum but um i think there was so many positives that that i saw yes um that i i really didn't have that much guilt about it well good good course what really helps is when you know you have to right yeah that made it real easy but i i  okay i don't have a budget my wife and i i should make that clear i've been married thirty three years and we've never had and we don't follow budgets but i've got the greatest system going i just don't handle any money and i told her when we got married that i am going to earn so much money and she can spend it on what she wants but if she ever spends more than i earn she's got to go to work she's never gone to work yet so smart woman so it worked so it's so you know it's really great so i you know to answer their question i we don't we don't have a budget yeah we don't we don't uh we didn't when we first got married uh i've been married only about four years my wife always wanted to write something down and keep track and i said look Mary i said you you get money we should save a little bit um-hum and uh whatever else you know play it by ear go spend on whatever you spend it on and if at the end of the month our checking account is no good then we got to sit down and and decide what we're going to stop spending it on but until that happens let's not worry about it yep um and since then we've both been done pretty well regarding uh raises and stuff at our jobs and and our rent has stayed relatively low um-hum and now we haven't had that problem yet and then my we we just had our first child about two months ago and then i said well we'll see what happens then because she she had to take some time off work and she probably will even quit her job now and maybe do some part time work um-hum but we still haven't had a problem paying the rent so i don't know what the i guess i'm blessed in the sense that i have a good enough job that i don't have to worry about that yeah you live right in New York City yeah i live in Manhattan i work out in Queens oh which is also part of New York City there's just five boroughs uh-huh uh-huh so your rent is quite expensive as compared to what we're accustomed to back here probably yeah except for i have a a rent um stabilized apartment um so the rent is only seven hundred and fifty dollars a month which for New York is extremely inexpensive in a very good neighborhood oh i see oh yeah yeah well that's great no i can you know again i can see the reason for them i have i have two grown kids and one my youngest son is Ken they both have very very good jobs they live in Chicago they have absolutely no problem they have no need for it and my eldest son he very definitely has to live by a budget because he just cannot control control his finances but i don't you know i cannot see this which i have a very close sister-in-law that everything she does at the beginning of the month or every payday she sits sits down and fills envelopes and i've i find that that's a tedious bore i mean if we had to live like that i'm not so sure i'd want to continue working but for them it works so i mean whatever uh our system works for us we we have a policy my wife and i both that we don't everything we have is ours as far as money we don't holdout holdout on each other or anything else and never really had a problem but i do believe in uh retirement investment programs very much so uh nowadays you sound like you're fairly young so i you know i keep telling my kids for God's sakes get involved in it because when they retire they should have a half dollars yeah i i i i agree the same i mean you know i i see too many elderly people with my mother uh is a social worker and she works with the elderly um-hum and uh you know in in your i don't know how how much older you're i'm thirty and i'm fifty eight so yeah uh you're generation has gotten pretty lucky regarding or at least in this area regarding real estate you know they went and bought a house for fourteen thousand dollars and then they they were sixty years old and retired um-hum and sold that same house for two hundred fifty thousand dollars and you know moved down to Florida or did whatever they had to do but they had all this capital um i don't know if the real estate market's gonna say the same for one thing i'm thirty i'm an attorney and uh i don't own a house yeah um-hum which i think is unusual because all the my parents' friends owned houses when we were growing up and now i grew up in suburbia as opposed to in the city but still yeah um but someday i'd like to own a house and and i i've certainly um make it a point that that i will put some money away um uh maybe a little less now while my wife isn't working so that someday we can have a house and we can that would be our capital and in addition to that i have at work they have you know uh investment plans where you can avoid having to go through um paying taxes but your entire um-hum right oh those things are great i boy i encourage those yeah you're you don't own a house and i'm fifty eight and i just built my fourth home yeah really so i just took on another mortgage don't ask me why i really don't but it's tax fourth you have four homes now or four okay i've had no i've had four no not all at the same time but this is the fourth one i've owned and this one i built but i'm looking at this as an investment so i hope real estate keeps climbing and it's a brand new area so it should yeah yeah i mean at this point in this area i mean it's it's absolutely ludicrous my my uh just the main you know just the taxes and upkeep of a house would cost me more than i'm paying in rent now obviously i get the right
