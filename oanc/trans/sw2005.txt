 so what are the benefits working for a large organization gosh i wouldn't know i've never worked for a large organization uh uh that will make it interesting well i will take that back i i was in the Air Force for thirteen years i guess that qualifies as a large organization yeah i i would qualify the U S government as large if not too large sort of large yeah just a little bit little bit bigger than TI yeah yeah okay i never really counted that as an organization because it's uh the benefits are funny yeah the benefits are strange they change every day and uh you don't really have a lot of choice yeah not like TI do you want this or do you want this or do you want this well we don't have that kind of choice either um oh oh i mean you certain yeah out here in the real world it's all the same oh really no matter who your employer is no i mean you have the choice of taking this health insurance or or some other or something like that uh yeah uh yeah here in the Springs we have a choice of two either an HMO or a company health insurance yeah yeah so there are two yeah of course i can't say we didn't have a choice if you always wanted to you could uh go out and buy your health insurance out of your own jeans yes yeah out of your own jeans and stay a way from the base hospital which is generally what i did ooh kind of scary it was that bad huh uh i i never fully trusted them the only time i ever went there was when i had to for a flight physical or something uh which has to be their doctor but they're not doing anything to me other than testing me so i let them do that well there are other benefits with the military well i don't i that the civilians don't get yeah i don't i don't i don't bad mouth the military too much i had a i had a good time well i just meant from a benefit standpoint well from benefit well that's one of the reasons i made a decision to get out uh i what i perceived as the benefits were just eroding yeah uh well the their pension plan is really good yeah you know that part is good except for the except for the little thing that you're paying into social security for twenty years and when you start and then you can't draw it that's right and then and then you start drawing your retirement pay and if you start drawing the social security they offset your retirement dollar for dollar yes and i always thought that that that was a big rip off uh yeah well on the other side of the fence but still the way it works is that uh some employers although they have a qualified pension plan they don't have a viable pension plan yeah yeah and we won't mention any names don't worry they're recording every word i know i didn't say it was them oh okay you're right you're right but i didn't but but i didn't say it wasn't either that's right we will let them draw their own conclusions that's right draw your own inference um uh but but but what you are saying about the military times is is true i mean fifty percent uh of your base pay is pretty good and uh medical for the rest of your life yeah that you know that sounds great on paper but it's not it's not something that i would look would look forward to well we have we have had some medical i mean some military retirees work up here for us or a bunch really and they did use the heck out of the medical yeah military medical yeah now the military dental was poor no now uh-huh at best yeah but the medical seemed somewhat adequate somewhat adequate yeah i mean don't get me wrong for something something that was major i i wouldn't have any problems with them it's the daily uh go in with the with the flu or something like that and and the the treatment is terrible i mean first you wait for hours and hours and hours and then the guy says you have a temperature well i knew that we're going to give you Sudafed you know i've been taking Sudafed for two weeks it doesn't do any good that's all i can do that's all i can do yeah yeah yeah uh i'm a member of an HMO and uh from all indications it's quite similar to the military yeah yeah well that that's HMO's are designed that way i mean they are going to they're gonna they're gonna get the most bang for their buck yeah exactly and and uh you know they're they're in the big profit making business and so and so the single benefits that i consider among the most important are medical insurance yeah absolutely because without it you can be broke for the rest of your life that's it forever and ever all all you have to do is you don't have it let something bad happen and that hospital will slap a lien on you so fast because they do it routinely yeah and yes and the funny thing is that uh private medical insurance grossly expensive yeah oh i know i know if you are not a member of a group i know my roomie's got the ins urance through the school uh-huh and it runs fifty eight i think fifty eight bucks a month something like that an that's not bad but you don't get anything that's not bad i mean to tell you well you get what you pay for don't you that's exactly right i mean it's nothing um uh it doesn't cover doctors or anything else it's crazy doesn't cover doctors no i mean you can go it will cover something major but forget about things like eyes or your teeth or anything else what it is it's medical insurance on paper are you covered yes are you covered really no that's right read between the lines are you covered no so but you know i mean the whole health care thing in the states is so screwed up that uh yes it uh it's totally ridiculous it it's a shame it's it is i mean i'm one of those forty million Americans running around with no health insurance at the moment in our state currently when in Colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax they ask you if you have medical insurance if you do you have to pay for those that don't have medical insurance huh i think it's two or four dollars a person i don't remember something along those lines but it still the idea irks me so that yeah well it's sort of like North Carolina North Carolina has an interesting thing on their income tax uh they create money tax you with or to tax you on there's a neat little formula on the back that you have to complete and assuming you're you're you're at poverty line where you're uh deduction or you take the standard deduction of thirty two fifty uh that will work out to an additional three hundred dollars right tacked on to your taxable income yeah and of course it goes higher and higher the more money you make oh no but the very least that anybody filing income tax form will have to pay on is three hundred dollars and they create money out of thin air huh i attached a little note to my my return when i sent it in saying gee i didn't know i had this extra three hundred dollars i wonder where it went uh Colorado is a nifty thing if you or they did until last year in times past if you got a federal tax refund uh-huh you paid state income tax the next year on the refund yeah Alabama did that too and i always thought well this is pretty nifty you taxed me when i made the money the feds and now you're taxing me again on it yeah the feds took it out and now they're giving it back to me and now you're going to tax it again i seem i seem to recall recall something about revolutions and wars about double and triple taxation and stuff yes yeah course uh course it it's the by word now i mean let let's tax everything three or four times and there are tax revolutions going on currently there should be but the problem is it's not an armed insurrection no eleven it's not a violent overthrow of the people in Washington no because because quite honestly the American people are so apathetic about everything Washington can do what they want to do and they are trying to take away our guns yeah that too i'm a lifelong member of the NRA i'm not as militant as i was when i was younger but i still firmly believe in the right to own and bear arms and those people that say that all that in the Constitution was guaranteeing is that we will have a militia yeah that's garbage i think they are sorely mistaken they're they're wrong the militia in those days was the common man there was no organization of militia the militia made up the everyday common man he pulled his squirrel rifle off his wall as he walked out in the yard that's right and and if they said hey we need a militia then all the able bodied men were supposed to show up  go ahead okay do i still can't still can feel that the Soviet Union as such is still a threat to the civilized western world absolutely and my reasons are based upon not only from what i read in the newspapers what i see on the newspapers but up against some of the fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the Fifth Special Forces Group um okay i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be but i think just the instability of the country right now uh-huh well that's what makes it a powder keg so scary the um i'll go back in time a little bit to about eighty one uh-huh when my first real involvement with the military started um naturally we were at the time the Soviet Union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat so we got lots quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on Soviet tactics and weapons uh-huh i went to Lebanon in eighty three before the marines ever got there with the UN Peace Keeping Force and with the training i received prior to going there with captured weapons we kept running up against these weren't these weren't Chinese made copies these were Soviet made top of the line fresh out of the box AK-47s um uh-huh as well as a lot of the explosives we were running into in Granada in October twenty fifth eighty three we invaded the place sure there were Cuban soldiers there but there was also a bunch of Russian advisors that were damn good shots the team i was with we jumped in on the western tip of of the island down on Point Salinas and for every Cuban there was at least five Russian advisors huh and they were all shooting state of the art Soviet weapons in eighty four i was down in Central America as an advisor to the Honduran army again we were running up against Cubans quite a bit plus Soviet advisors and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material do i consider them a threat absolutely they have a university in Moscow called the Patrice de Lamumba University about like A and M or UT where they're teachings subjects like that they're teaching terrorism some of the people we went up against in Lebanon were graduates from that place and let me tell you they are nothing nice to go up against huh i'm surprised during this Iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did these guys are top of the line when they when they graduate from there they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world and they are very very good at what they do so until i see the entire quote old guard of the Soviet military of the Soviet government completely roll over and disappear preferably buried i still consider them a threat uh-huh their military is different from ours to where there are extremist generals generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops that irregardless of what Soviet policy is they're going to do what the general tells them yeah i guess that's what concerns me the most is they're they're so unstable that somebody like that could make uh decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people well it's interesting interesting watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania doing their little revolts down there uh-huh each one of those sectors has got a Soviet general over the troops that are there so far they hadn't run into the real psychos yet there's probably five or six which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs that are in positions over some of these Soviet states if uprisings happen happen in their sectors it is it's going to be a total blood bath yeah it looks like it's come close to that as it is actually they're showing remarkable restraint they get real nasty the Hyundee helicopters come out and they would level entire areas okay you're from the Dallas area right uh-huh okay you know basically the size of uh the area around Richardson yeah you put five Soviet Hyundee helicopters in the air they can level the entire area and there won't be anything left alive and they can do that in about four minutes huh and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by they used them in Afghanistan did remarkably remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in but on a highly populated area like some of the Soviet cities would be with the weaponry that's attached on those things there is no place to hide if the bombs don't get you if the bullets don't get you then the then the nerve gas definitely will get you the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time they drink that much fuel uh-huh were you have you i take it you haven't spent any time in the military no i haven't as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in never did make the newspapers but uh-huh during that same time frame didn't you get some feeling that i mean they're getting all these weapons and stuff didn't it it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff you mean in the in the most recent conflict in any of them since eighty one oh yeah definitely i i'm i'm a little bit shocked to what the US has done in terms of selling to Iraq in the past ten to fifteen years yeah i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the Soviets do it it all boils down to whether it's our side their side it's a matter of money to a certain extent um uh-huh the deal the Iraqi's have with the Russians was for oil yeah it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons especially when it's to the south of us uh the ones to the south are more regional conflict they're not really that worried about invading north they're more interested in they've got a screwed up situation i'll give them that from Mexico all the way down into Central Central and South America the situation down there is weird and it's very screwed up uh-huh inflation is out of this world and the governments which our government has technically supported for years are corrupt as all get out and generally the people are getting screwed and they're tired of it and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it even if that means going to communism yeah well i think Russia is getting to the point where they're they're about to do something to get out of communism i guess i'd would like to see somebody like Yeltsin to get more power i think Gorbachev has about had his day unfortunately Yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing Gorbachev has m ade his attempt and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself yeah uh-huh Yeltsin's in tight wi th the old guard so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils at this point uh-huh true i don't know i sure wouldn't turn my back on them you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh or they reduced the number of troops in Europe after the Berlin Wall went down i thought that was great but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out uh-huh it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there but you still better have the key players in place if something does go down even if it's a regional conflict if United States is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is not only does it it can talk the talk but it's got to be able to walk the walk it's got to have the stuff to back it back up what it's saying if you've only got a token force there you can't hold your ground at least they're learning a little bit from history i mean uh  okay um i guess what i guess my my task i usually ride my bike i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike and when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because it's so much nicer the stationary bike is is so um boring boring but i have head phones and i plus i have it uh in the living room so i either watch TV or we have a fish tank so i watch the fish you know whatever i can do to keep myself occupied if i like to have the TV on because that usually keeps me um more occupied it kind of takes the time away and i don't realize really that's really the only time i ever watch TV is when i'm on the bike but and then usually after i'm done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know to where i'm not quite as tired i guess but it's definitely a task i can't say that i really enjoy it i wish that i did enjoy it more but i do it because i have to not because i want to you think so i bought a stationary bike but i find that if i sit on that seat too long it hurts yeah yeah and i haven't figured how to get that soft and i tried even tying a pillow to it but two years ago i joined well it's not quite two years it's almost two years i joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano uh-huh and i love it i just love it really so is it just women that go there yeah it's totally women see i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club because i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise you know so i have tried to just do stuff at home and uh i just feel conscious about it i mean i'm not big you know or anything but i still don't like other people watching me you know i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess yeah uh feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i don't have to be conscious of right of it being a little bit too low and i my bathing suit's just one piece so there's no big deal all the way around but i don't have to be conscious of what i'm doing or how i'm doing it uh-huh and it's uh oh it's just i don't know it's a it's a total free relaxation because hey you can do what you want you're a female and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing that's what and they've got such fantastic equipment in there really that's that's great how oh yeah and i love the water aerobics i love the water aerobics do they have a pool or what is oh yeah they've got a nice one huh they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it i've heard that that's really good for you to do it pushes you because you're pushing against the water in itself so it is like double strenuous but you're not uh-huh being double strenuous on your own body because you're pushing it yourself uh-huh so you're doing it yourself but so you don't really feel like you're really working that hard do you when you're in the water huh-uh the only thing that i ever felt was every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting two jobs once in a while i end up having to quit for a while but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because i really jump a lot oh wow well that's funny i never would have thought of that but well a lot of people wear those little uh terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool so they just wear them right into the pool like water are they water shoes is that yeah they're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles so that you know no big deal one way or the other oh okay okay okay okay huh that's really funny but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal huh but it's fun that's so how often do find yourself going um on a if you're doing it on a regular basis how often do you go i try to make it at least three times a week yeah that's really for a while i was doing it every day just really going uh five days a week i wish that i could make myself exercise every day but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i don't feel like is enough but uh it's it's at least something you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really don't enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean it's just it's it's not a question of whether i want to you know well but when i was working up at uh The Summit here in Plano i'd leave there uh-huh and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock oh that's oh actually about four thirty because they start at five to six so i was there by four thirty every night and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet uh-huh because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet uh-huh but the water only comes up basically to your anywhere from your waist to your oh chest i'd say yeah so i mean it's your choice where you want to go but did you ever i enjoyed it higher well i'm sorry that's okay uh did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for TI i have a i have a bad back did you ever try that so i'm very limited what i do oh okay it's like i can walk but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me um especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard it will bother me it will bother me then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldn't it well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i w ent in there is wasn't for the water aerobics i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles oh and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more wow i said okay because i'm not a swimmer uh-huh i like water i'm not scared of it but i couldn't i guess i could swim across the pool but i'm no swimmer per se yeah but i found that this worked really well and i came out of there and i saw my stomach going down well oh i dropped oh i'd say almost twenty pounds wow just by watching what i ate and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good what if you're already on one i mean yeah i mean when you go in there they wouldn't make you do theirs would they what a diet oh no they have nothing to do with that okay see i joined uh when this one down here opened up i joined as a VIP and the VIP gives you uh oh gives you a diet a computerized diet and they go over all your health and all your history and they show you how everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards so it became part of the package so i went through it but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what you're saying it worked out well oh yeah you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too i see okay i just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit so it was it's less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time um after all this time so it's like when i got laid off i went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since i'd done it um so i get all the same treatment again so it's kind of nice wow that's like i said i like it i like the heat i like the i jump out of the swimming pool and i go into the hot tub oh and i love it yeah that would be really nice because i have never i have never let me reword that i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did uh-huh that's i knew i was pushing too far uh-huh but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out i'm totally relaxed when i go home it's no big deal so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your it's fun it's fun uh i've gotten on the bike and they've got uh the stepping bike where you step uh-huh and i've enjoyed that watching how well i can can walk up and down stairs that's you know i wanted but most of the others to me are very dull i wanted to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike but i got talked into the bike instead and i don't know i really wanted a stepper i'm considering maybe even buying one of those too but i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them i mean i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them which one do you feel is better since you use them both um i get bored very easily uh the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the TV and not even really be conscious of what you are doing uh-huh with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down huh so you have a little you know little you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so uh-huh to what your gear is uh i it would depend upon which one you want i think now that i've had the bicycle i would go to the stepper but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while because you can buy a month's membership and see what you feel is best for you oh really um because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do because i jump on the bike here at home mine has its see the handle bars go up and down so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said and it has no effect on me uh-hum so i mean it's boring uh-huh  okay um yeah one year public service for everybody is that that was it right right uh who wants to start this one i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um uh i mean the first thing is the oh if it's going to be mandatory it's got to be mandatory i mean everybody not just like you know poor people and all that you know but right right you know senators' sons and all that stuff too i mean everybody's got to do it um i don't know it'd probably be it'd probably be good i just don't know if you know i was eighteen or whatever i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision uh i mean uh that that doesn't sound right um i guess i see overall beneficial if if we're going from that point of view uh-huh um i you know in the past i don't know i don't know how old you are but when i was uh in high school was uh beginning of Vietnam and so forth and many of my peers were being drafted uh-huh and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever but i i felt strongly then that even if they didn't feel like they could kill someone or go into a military situation that they could help the country in other ways be it cleaning out uh lots in in their neighborhood or whatever kind of community or public service might be available uh-huh and i guess i see that as as not so much a a demand but but a privilege it's it's kind of uh uh yeah is um it's something it's it's since we live here and we all benefit rich poor or in between uh there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest i just see that as maybe a good idea i wouldn't mind doing it at forty four uh-huh uh and i find ways to to turn some of that back to to others uh and i i guess i i can't see that as being something to really object to well i guess it's gonna depend on how i mean if if you're talking about any if you're talking about something that's like a full time you know one year full time you know this is what you do you know you're going to go and and fill pot holes and you know and you know all that stuff i mean i you know i don't know i could see a a full a run a gamut of different kinds of opportunities things that need to be done that would that could be done in an hour or two uh-huh uh-huh uh a day or several hours of the week like a half of a day on Saturday or something like that in addition to what one does uh-huh uh besides that i i can't imagine what kind of uh uh bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time oh you're going to go to this camp and you're going to you know like um back in the Depression the CCC the the construction corps that went out and did things that was great it was needed it gave folks some jobs and we got some great public works out of it but yeah um i don't see that as being necessary now i can see it being done uh on a regular schedule uh-huh uh everybody has to put in so many hours of uh public service in a given time perhaps uh-huh uh i i guess i see all of us benefiting and i i don't see it just relegated to the young but i see i i see so much going on that that's bad and this would give them a chance to have some positive self esteem something that they turn back uh-huh well and and also you know you you you feel more like you know you're actually part of the community if you've done something in it that's right you take pride in that and and get some some positive feedback from those who benefit besides yourself uh-huh and i i see it being most beneficial if it's in the neighborhood where or or at least the area where the person lives it may not be the same neighborhood but the same city or county uh definitely because then you're you're coming in contact with it it's not as meaningful for me to go to Minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again unless i happen to go on vacation up there right yeah it's so it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual on going yeah but as far as putting that into work i don't want to i don't want to deal with the with the heartache of first of all getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics oh uh that would be a nightmare and just i mean just getting getting it going yeah yeah i i see a lot of things like uh scouting uh uh-huh Boys Clubs Girls Clubs things like that that kind of get into that citizenship uh the uh looking after the environment sort of thing and and i guess i don't see uh this being that different but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in and would take a turn in uh-huh uh-huh yeah do you have kids no uh no not yet about six months we will oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many kids so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose and i can see you know some some really significant things coming out of it uh-huh i know you've got to get past that that grudge attitude that many have but that's uh that that would be a part of selling it to the community to the adults ahead of them that probably would never serve and and to each succeeding generation there'd definitely have to be a major PR campaign in each community each county uh-huh uh-huh uh parish or however the state was divided up hum i may well i don't know around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for Boy Scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will uh police a uh a couple of miles of the highway and keep and i i've seen it in other states too i don't know yeah they have that here um they've got um in most of the states around here i think uh um you know down in North Carolina there was a big controversy for a while because the uh the local chapter of the KKK wanted to uh um to participate in it and uh there was a and there were those that said no you can't do that i'm sure yeah well uh it was it was interesting because that's an interesting question you know should these people be allowed to or not i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed yeah oh and i hadn't even thought about that uh the other the other end of that that that's an interesting uh situation i hadn't thought of that we had visited relatives in Virginia not too long ago and i thought i had seen when we were traveling around the state some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up and yeah i think Virginia's got it and i know Maryland does and we just we went to Indianapolis last weekend and back and um i'm pretty sure i saw yeah stuff in Ohio and Indiana Indiana about it and Pennsylvania maybe Pennsylvania i don't remember for sure now and i don't know about your part of the country but uh down here in the last year oh year plus i it was last beginning with last year's Earth Day uh-huh there's just been more of a turn toward uh environmental concerns and even i work for Texas Instruments and they they've started some recycling campaigns that uh-huh a year before that had been turned down because they said well it's not feasible it's not a good idea uh-huh yeah and but then they lost too much business and i see that as being i i see that as being a a a change um it for the positive kind of along the same line as as as the mandatory thing it's just thing a part of everyone's consciousness uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you remember like in the early seventies and all that and yeah you know and then it kind of just went out of vogue and i i'm worried that it it might you know it'll it the same thing will happen it's like you know environmentalism was really big for a couple of years and then people like well you know i'd ruther rather spend you know fifty cents less on uh on on such and such you know and even if it's not environmentally safe who cares you know i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way uh there have been too many other things that it's done that for just in my life and if you look at history at all you see that you know uh we go from one side to the other on just about any subject that you one might care to bring up but yeah it is comforting to me to see uh more concern about some of these things that that cost us money especially when we have dwindling uh resources such as oil that's burning out of control in in the Persian Gulf and and so forth just just every little bit does it makes me feel better it it makes me feel like well there may be something left for my children my nieces and nephews and so forth well yeah uh well uh wouldn't it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may may make some people realize that hey you know this stuff runs out that's that's right because of course that's probably blasphemy for you to say uh coming from where you are in Texas uh no no because if we what was it in seventy four when we had the the last last oil crisis and and uh we started getting smart and and we were looking all these alternative sources of energy and so forth uh-huh and as soon as the oil prices came back down we the pendulum swung the other way and we need those reminders right yeah uh or we'll suddenly be in the dark and say oh my goodness now we don't have the ability to go on to some new technology right well my dad's in the in the solar energy business ah so um you know we're acutely aware of a lot of this but you know on the other hand he voted for George Bush so um you know i i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing i'm sure you are well i this you know just about anybody you could name whether i voted for them or not uh makes um uh uh-huh decisions that i just can't go along with but uh that's why they're there and not me i don't want the i don't want the stress and the strain yeah well the the thing with Bush  so uh i don't know what you mean by camping but i mean tent kind of camping i guess that's what i normally do that's what yeah yeah well do you yeah yeah nothing like RVs or anything like that because uh my father and i in like back in eighty three we went camping uh camping down the Appalachian Trail oh really the whole length or uh no no uh it was just for three days we must have done like uh sixty miles or something uh-huh um-hum was it very crowded out there or no no not at all but uh you had uh you know there was one part like we were waiting to get some water right and we were looking at where we could get some water and it said you know it was like yeah we can either try to get here tonight or just sleep it and try to get there tomorrow morning and we said okay let's just sleep in and try to get there tomorrow morning uh-huh and so when we got there the water that we were supposed to drink wasn't potable like well you couldn't drink it right and so what we had to do is we had to get on the trail or on the road yeah and start walking down the road and then we found this little hut a couple of miles down that had you know that sold stuff uh-huh so we just stopped there uh you know had some breakfast got some water and kept on walking sure and then uh my mother who went to pick us up we had a barbecue and it was it was cool it was like you know you see a lot of deer up there yeah yeah and uh like one time i opened up the the tent and there was a deer drinking out of a stream um and so it was it was cool you know and and it was just uh very tiring though yeah the last the last big camping trip i was on was uh probably a few years after that but it was in the Pagosa Springs area in Colorado a bunch of us uh from here went up there and uh okay and i got hit by the same thing because we thought we were going to be real mountain men and uh we got up there and we had the little pills you're supposed to put in the water and make sure that it's potable yeah yeah and of course we're up you know up above you know fourteen thousand feet or whatever and we said well well how dirty could the water be right you never never think about bacteria or amoeba or anything like that right you think well nobody's using the bathroom farther up stream so it's got to be all right so we were doing things like uh you know we all had our little collapsible cups and we were going up to where the water was coming over rocks and all that and we'd just kind of stick our cups in there and drink and then we were there for five or six days and and and it was neat you know we saw deer and uh yeah had to put our uh food up in the in the trees and all that i was the unlucky guy that got up every morning and said well i guess might as well putz around here while everyone else is sleeping so i was usually the guy who had to get it out of the tree and all that yeah yeah yeah i was uh i told my dad you know it was like listen dad you know that i sleep a lot of hours right yeah and so he goes yeah i do okay so he goes you know at least i sleep you know maybe ten hours so if we go to bed at you know eight or something right right so he goes well if you go to bed at eight then you'll wake up like six in the morning that's right and then i go no no maybe i sleep more than ten hours you know and that's that's right you don't want to be the first one up and have to put the fire on and have to take take care of everything while everyone else is sacked out yeah and then if they wake up and you haven't done everything it's like why haven't you done that but uh well we were drinking you know back to that uh water thing and of course i got sick about the second or third until the end of the day i'm i'm uproariously sick and i'm in the tent sweating it out yeah and the two guys i was with they were like well this you're a wimp you know because we've been drinking out of the water and we're okay so they went out fly fishing and they're having a great time uh-huh and and just all the way back to Dallas i'm just uproariously sick and uh we get back here and of course the first day back at work i go to work and where are these guys and they were off both off a week sick because they were just it's just like it took them a little longer to hit it hit and it hit them and they were just like calling into work going oh i'm miserable i'm i'm just it hit them wham i can't keep anything down i'm and i just cramps and i'm just going hey tell me about it right yeah and uh but uh that was probably the last big camp that's probably the last big camping trip i've i've gone on i haven't gone in a few years on anything real big what uh do you work for TI uh no no but i know somebody who does and that's how i got into this so but uh oh okay but in fact it's funny that's this was the topic because i was just reading Outside Magazine here this morning and uh and that some big issue on the only way to camp about about canoe camping yeah and uh and i've i've done a lot of canoeing but never have camped out over night and and they makes a lot make a lot of good points about at least with a canoe you don't have to carry everything yeah you can throw big tents and food and and stoves and everything in and all you have to do is just you don't even have to if you go downstream you hardly even have to paddle and it's uh yeah well it all depends on what the rapids are like well that's true too as long as you're not going to going to hit any white water or you know if you're just doing a nice calm river it's uh it's it uh you don't have to put very much effort into it yeah and uh boys i guess as i get older that'll get more and more appetizing and then all you'll have will be road camping trips you know let's just go out to the mountains with the car honey and uh the truck and that's that's right and uh and if we're lucky we'll talk somebody into taking the car downstream and we'll just throw the canoe in there and uh and uh tell you what we'll just we'll just float downstream and uh that's that's yeah really no paddling no paddling we'll just grab the rudder and you you work the rudder yeah that's about as tough as nope that's just keep us off a rock and we'll just let the let the stream take us down river and all that yeah but uh but uh well you over there in Carolina North Carolina you probably get a lot of chance to you've got a lot of rivers and a lot of uh white white water over there i think uh-huh yeah but since but i'm a you know i'm a student and so uh-huh and i also don't have any transportation yeah and so the the people that actually do camp do camp i don't i don't really get along with them you know they're like i don't know if i could stand to being you know two days in the woods with them you know uh-huh yeah yeah that's probably true because uh that's and so because you have to know who you're going with to get along that's true you can't even uh because i know uh even i and my wife would probably uh have a hard time sitting in sitting out in the woods for a couple of days and uh you've really got to be careful who you go out there with and that they're out they're out fo r what they're doing and you're out for what you want to do and then you all get get to do what you want to do i guess while you're out there but uh yeah yeah oh well well well all right bye bye it was nice talking to you bye bye  let's see did i press one yes did i okay i didn't know whether you could hear because i i have to take the phone away from my ear to do it i guess that was one did you hear it i heard the beep all right we're on uh hey Rick who's your favorite team uh i guess the Durham Bulls oh okay and uh uh we're not to have much mutual interest there but i'm curious uh uh what class are they class A yeah they're i think a farm league of the Braves oh okay but uh they're they're the closest by team to Raleigh North Carolina yeah do you go do you go see them very often yeah actually uh we went a couple of times last year i haven't gone they started i guess about a week ago well i imagine they're just starting yeah do you you know what's exciting about watching i never watched minor league teams until i came to Texas because i was raised one near Boston following the Red Sox and then i went to graduate school in Pittsburgh so i became a Pirate fan um-hum um-hum okay and i was never in a minor league city until i came Dallas we were a minor league city when i came here in fifty nine and i immediately bought season tickets uh to the class triple A uh uh Dallas Rangers um-hum okay and then the class uh double A Dallas Fort Worth Spurs we later uh they went to the Texas league um and uh i just really enjoy it i guess i enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out playing here and then seeing them a year or two later as as stars in the majors yeah yeah uh and i i think that's probably the fun of watching minor league baseball and the other thing is watching guys on the other end uh guys that i had seen play for both the Red Sox and Pittsburgh um uh they get to the other end of their career and now they come up and talk to you between innings of games i i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time yeah uh not not yet i mean i not yet okay well of course you're at the class A level you're a few years away from that yeah uh hang on a second Rick i got to see who that is okay you still there Rick yes yeah uh uh do you follow any major league teams at all sure uh which ones uh i like the Phillies and the Dodgers oh okay okay well how do you think they're going to do this year um fair i don't know the Phillies are so uh unpredictable fair huh yeah yeah but i think the Dodgers will do well well i think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent market didn't they yeah yeah and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go yeah i don't know he's getting old i think they got their money their money's worth out of him though yeah i think they probably did he probably i was reading the other day that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young yeah they say that if a guy's pitching that that his arm is still developing until he's twenty five and if pitches a whole lot of innings before that it may take its toll later in life um of course i've been watching Nolan Ryan this afternoon and uh it doesn't seem to bother him yeah um uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what he's done yeah well have you heard anything about Jim Palmer uh well Palmer tried a comeback and uh got sore arm early and they uh the Rangers are playing Baltimore this game that i'm watching and just the last inning they put the camera over on he and Brooks Robinson they are the broadcast team for the Orioles now right right and apparently apparently his uh his come back just didn't make it and that he got he got hurt early in the uh in the uh uh in the spring training uh yeah um oh the the Dodgers the Dodgers have got an interesting thing they've got this uh rookie pitcher what's it Martinez his name that uh that pitched a bunch of innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year old year old and they were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should be careful and not over work him this early of course i was really uh right uh a Dodger fan a couple of years ago when they won the World World Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series that was that was really a the the year they beat the As yeah that was really dramatic they were uh yeah the year they beat the As i was really and boy i can still remember that Kirk Gibson home run they were such under dogs yeah they were because everybody thought the As were the greatest things in the world and uh we've got we're the only ones around here that got cable and that particular game was some reason or another was on a cable channel and uh my son's in high school and all his friends were here yeah um um we're all sitting around we must have had ten people in our living room watching it gosh gosh everybody just erupted when that happened and uh that was uh uh strictly an outstanding game uh the uh yeah yes uh the Dodgers the Phillies i'm not uh you know the National League we have an American League team here so i don't get that much into the National League stuff here i see them on the game of the week occasionally and i haven't seen the the Phillies yeah that much i know that Mike Smith retiring a couple of years ago left a big hole offensively who do the Phillies look to to drive in a lot of runs yeah i don't even know anymore i i follow the Dodgers more than the Phillies but uh i i grew up in Philadelphia i guess that's why who do they of course you know Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that uh uh they won the World Series and Kirk Gibson Who who are are the Dodgers big RBI guys now um-hum i think i um i don't know i thought i don't know yeah well i'm a i'm a Texas Ranger fan yeah and uh you you know they are O and four but i think they're going to be one and four at the end of today they're sitting here with two out in the ninth with a uh fifteen to three lead uh i think that's pretty that looks that was fairly comfortable yeah and it was why and Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today and he gave up three runs in first inning and i said oh my God here we go again you know you know with two outs walk walk home run b ang we're down three to nothing pretty good guess huh-uh but they got four in their half of the first and then Nolan was invincible hum he went out after the seventh and had he had only give up those uh that one hit in the first inning and another hit so he went out after the seventh inning with a uh it at the time he had a uh i think uh a nine to three ten to three lead and uh hum oh uh he had only given up two hits and uh two walks and nine strike outs so he's he's back in the groove and a a guy his age this this afternoon here it's about seventy nine degrees hum um-hum a little bit humid clear blue sky and the sunshine and the Rangers don't play many afternoon games because of the heat we have here in the summer right but uh they try to play Sunday afternoons in April May and in September and uh uh with the bright sky like this where you've got a real bright day when he's out there throwing ninety four ninety five miles an hour he's almost invincible right um and uh that's just a exciting uh is really exciting sitting here watching him on TV this afternoon and um wow often how often do you go out to the baseball park uh well it different times different years because because because my uh uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers um yeah yeah won uh eighty three games last year which was just four more than they lost but we had an exciting time and that at one time in about the June July and August period we went to about eight straight wins um wow and we happen to go out there on win night and uh uh they and they got hot then and i'm not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less but um um what we like to do the uh the stands have got three tiers to them and we like to be in the third tier behind home plate about the second row right um and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think there's going to be forty thousand there's just too big crowds i i pick the games where they don't yeah expect to have a high attendance and uh what what about your your ball park in in Raleigh uh the minor league ball park in Durham it's uh it's actually in Durham they're they're thinking about moving it to Raleigh but it's it holds maybe four thousand and it's like three dollars to get in yeah four thousand so oh that is great when i got here in the class triple A Rangers we used to yeah pay two and if you bought a season ticket it was only one dollar a game yeah and uh uh that is fine and not only that but you probably get some pretty good seats too oh yeah we're in the pretty much wherever you want to sit yeah yeah what do they do they have times of the year where they have promotions and you get gigantic crowds like maybe four thousand where they actually sell the place out yeah they they give out stuff and it's have you ever seen the movie Bull Durham i mean it's just like that exactly yes well a little more modern day but not much yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i love that movie i absolutely love that and i guess the players uh you know the class A salaries are are really uh not anything a guy can live on too much so i guess they've got to go out and find rooming houses and yeah yeah things like the guy in Bull Durham did With fairly economical accommodations yeah yeah and uh uh the other thing is that that's really hard but of course you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major league team and the problem we always had in triple A is you want to see the guys go good but then when they go good you know you're going to lose them yeah yeah you know during the season and i guess at at your level uh you lose them to the next level if if they decide to recall the the parent team the Braves decide to call to recall a guy from triple A then a double A guy goes up to replace him and a single A guy goes up to replace him yeah yeah and and and you've immediately uh now you got you you go out to the ball park and your favorite player is not there anymore and you say you've got you've got to learn his replacement but do you get any local uh do they broadcast games locally or televise them locally yeah yeah no there's actually there may be an AM station that does it i'm not there may be an AM station that does it but i'm not i'm not really sure no so you've you've got to uh uh yeah okay so so you you've pretty much got to the ball park uh uh to figure out but yeah but it's i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey let's go to the game and you'll get a seat yeah but yeah yeah uh uh there's probably that's pretty neat because i don't imagine Raleigh's so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other no i mean it's it's actually there's an interstate  okay do you want to go first you can go first or i will well you go ahead okay well i'm going to tell you what i'd have down in the South we have a lot of shrimp oh yeah okay and i have uh shrimp that is steamed in beer that i cook oh yeah uh-huh and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook garlic bread green salad tea and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert oh it sounds fantastic yes and what's really neat about it is the shrimp is cooked in your uh like your rice steamer your rice cooker oh yeah uh-huh and um you place the shrimp in the in the rice steamer and you put a bay leaf and put some uh red pepper over it uh-huh now you can either use you know the kind that comes in the little can or you can just get some you know regular red peppers is it cayenne pepper you mean cayenne uh-huh yes uh-huh and you put a little bit of that over it now if you use the dried kind yes then you would only use two of them and you put that in there and then you pour two bottles of beer over it and how much shrimp would you use two pounds two pounds okay that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up oh yeah uh-huh and you pour the beer over the top of it and you cover it and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil uh-huh okay and the shrimp turn pink then you remove it and you put it on a platter and then you serve it with melted butter and uh uh-huh i usually put garlic powder in mine oh yeah and they can just dip it and they shell it as they eat it sure but uh then the microwave uh the cauliflower you cook that in the microwave and what you do is you just uh wash it and you core it uh-huh uh-huh and in a like a oh what do you call it like Pyrex or something like that kind of bowl that would go in the microwave uh-huh a glass dish uh-huh uh-huh but it's got to have one that has a cover on it okay uh-huh and you uh put about two tablespoons of uh water into this bowl and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt yeah uh-huh and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time and it's are you cooking the whole head at one time okay uh-huh you uh when you core it you be real careful so you won't knock your flowers off i see and uh you just set it in there and you microwave it on high for seven minutes and you turn it one time and while that's cooking i take mayonnaise about a cup of mayonnaise uh-huh and a teaspoon of mustard and some garlic powder and i mix it all together and i shred up some just regular white cheese uh-huh and after that's cooked you take it out and pour this on top of it and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that and you cook it for another three minutes on high uh-huh you know just mainly to melt the cheese and everything and let all the seasoning melt into it and it's done yeah oh that sounds fantastic it is good but it it looks i mean what you can do then see is like what i usually do is i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle and then i put the uh shrimp around the outside of it you know on my platter um um uh-huh and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that and you know you have all the different seasonings and stuff and then i just fix little individual cups for them and they have the garlic bread and it makes it a real nice looking sure and it's not much work you know huh-uh huh-uh but it looks like it you know you look like you went to a whole bunch that sounds yeah really i bet it tastes good too right and uh usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up and put some color into it you know and i'll lay those on top of my salad you know to make it look nice and things like that oh yeah sure now how many could you serve okay uh it usually serves six yeah okay okay i figured about that yeah oh that's good see out here we have so many uh ethnic people we have Italians and we have Portuguese and we have Russians and Polish and it depends out here like the type of people you're going to entertain you know so it's hard uh you you just have to pick something for the the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time uh-huh yeah and uh they're big on finger food here too you know chicken wings and uh ribs and that kind of stuff uh barbecue yeah and uh cooking out in the yard it yard you know when it's nice barbecue outside chicken and that kind of stuff yeah have you ever had crawfish uh no but i have had shrimp oh you ought to try some crawfish they are good but see that's one good thing about living down here is usually anybody that comes over you know even if it's like out of town guests and stuff they want our cooking oh of course that's you know they want it from down here yeah because just like now especially crawfish it is starting to move out you know and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is really is it like shrimp but uh it's similar uh-huh it's similar yeah it's not exactly i mean it's got a taste of its own you know but it is it is similar to because you only eat the tails of it oh it does does it look like a lobster um it looks more like a crab oh it looks more like a crab oh uh-huh but are they thin long no or wide um let me think of i can't even think of what you i guess if it uh it looks like more like a cross between uh a crab and uh and a lobster because it's small like that and it's got the pinchers like a crab but uh-huh uh-huh but you know it's it's similar to a lobster too because the tail has got the little pleats in it like a lobster would oh yeah yep and we call them mud bugs oh but i mean they're fantastic tasting they are so good everybody it's it's the season for them right now and and where did you say you were from Louisiana Louisiana oh well do you do cajun cooking uh-huh oh yeah oh i love uh blackened you know uh the the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff oh we have a few places up here that do that uh-huh yeah and if ever i see it on the menu i always get it yes it is so good yeah you know now how do they do the blackened you buy it you buy it as a seasoning but uh do you have to have a certain skillet or something huh-uh huh-uh i cook mine well do you have a uh like a black iron skillet no i did have i don't have it now but i have mostly Teflon oh okay well i guess you could cook it in in that too but i don't know you know i never have i use uh uh the black iron skillet to cook mine you now but uh does does it have to get extremely hot uh-huh but it really it's not it it it doesn't burn or anything like that the blackening is really the seasoning yeah uh-huh oh oh i see i mean there is it's it's a blackening seasoning yeah you know i mean that is a seasoning that's really it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time or something like that to get it oh i see because it's called uh what it's called is Blackening Magic and it it comes in a bottle and uh oh well i'm trying to see it's got a a picture of Dom De Luise on it oh oh really uh-huh oh now would you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would prepare it any other time is that what you're saying right uh-huh oh uh-huh but because i could have the uh chicken on the skewers with uh uh blackened seasoning uh-huh and oh that is so good delicious yeah but you do have to have it you know you do have to have it hot when you cook it i mean your pan it does have to be really hot you know when you put it in but it's not like it's burned and it what it what blackens it is the seasoning uh-huh oh and it is so good oh it is i i love it i i in fact i was in Texas for a little while and i liked uh the barbecues and the Mexican food yeah uh-huh uh-huh i have a passion for all that type of different tastes because i have been brought up mostly Italian American food because my uh parents are Italian and Portuguese so we cook a lot of pasta and uh gravies and pizzas and you know roasts and that kind of thing that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and have you know trying different things uh-huh well have you ever thought about coming to Louisiana you know to visit i would love to yeah you ought to come down um you don't even have to go all the way to New Orleans you know if you want to really get some good food i really i mean you don't have to go that far south uh-huh but uh of course the further south you go the better the food is as far as i'm concerned and fact is we're going to take a vacation this year we're going to go to New Orleans again and uh is that right uh-huh we're only going down there for the food though now where where do you go when you go there uh right on Basin Street and those places uh yeah we go to the the French Quarters and stuff like that and uh i have some friends that live down there uh-huh and so usually we go to we don't go to the tourist ones we go to the ones that they tell us to go to you know oh oh i see and we went to this one it was called The Back Porch and uh they were cooking the stuff you know while we were we went on this boat ride and then we came back and ate out on this it was like a back porch oh that's nice and uh usually if you can find somebody of course now when you go down there you know i mean they've got just there's no where you can miss uh-huh i have never gone to a restaurant and not just been so full it's unreal and uh i mean it's so good the seasoning they it's just unreal really and don't they make a lot of um i'm trying to think what they call their soup i don't know gumbo yeah jumbo gumbo right is is is that with seafood no gumbo uh-huh right uh-huh you can even make it with chicken or you can make it with seafood oh you can uh-huh that looks good too i've seen them do the chefs on TV do that and oh it looks delicious uh-huh and i'll tell you what see we do um uh a thing we call it a sea bake you uh you take clams  well do you think uh i mean i wonder the assumption is that it is a problem uh and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem and uh but it's not clear to me that it is uh but um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way you know in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other just like everyone who did vote it's not clear to me that it is really a problem um that's that's interesting because i had thought i have feel that it's a problem also but um-hum i see your point on that i mean i i assume that those who don't vote i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote they tend to be you know poor blacks for example vote very little and things like that and i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting than your average voter but i don't know if that's the case in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't uh apparently they don't think it's a problem uh i guess not i'm i i vote religiously i really do um i guess i guess i'm a fan of democracy and uh that's right um but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly democratically oriented in in the sense of people being able to vote for things i mean we have these initiatives state initiatives now the first really popular you know wide spread one was uh Proposition Thirteen which was a uh tax revolt against property taxes uh right but it's funny because here in California things are getting uh increasingly and you know now we're and that was whatever ten years ago and now we're up to Proposition a Hundred and fifty or something like that i mean we've just there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were asked being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals and you had to vote for you know yes or no on each of them and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them and it was incredibly complicated and difficult and a lot of people revolted against that they said we don't want to have to decide all these things that's why we hire people who uh you know to to make these decisions for us i i kind of feel the opposite though i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us but they're not speaking for me yeah i do too uh-huh uh-huh yeah i wouldn't mind having oh more votes than i get to have frankly anyone who doesn't vote it's fine with me as long as i can have their vote that's true that would make me happy though maybe not in a in a deep philosophical sense but in a selfish sense it probably would i don't know it's interesting uh some countries voting is obligatory uh it is in Australia for example yeah well is that true i didn't know that i was thinking that is one solution to it yeah i don't know how i feel about that but i don't that's not really democratic not what i'd consider truly democratic as well Australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the United States and it's not for me to say that they're not um they they feel i mean here you have the right to vote and they simply define it as a duty there is uh-huh uh-huh you know we have just as we have a right a duty to pay taxes you know is that democratic i mean we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country we have the duty to pay taxes and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent it's a duty right and it's not clear to me that that's so much less democratic um uh-huh i don't know but part of me rebels against that but then i'm an American uh it that's it's complex question when you start thinking about it isn't it yeah yeah and some people don't vote i mean there is like three or four percent of Australians don't vote and i think they're eligible eligible for a fine i don't know if they actually are fined or or what happens but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote that's interesting i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote uh-huh and i think i think they feel they can criticize if they don't i told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize yeah i sort of see uh well i that's how i feel i mean if you if you vote and your guy looses well you least you least tried and you can say something but if you don't vote i sort of feel like part of me and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like well if you didn't vote you get what's coming to you you know and certainly that's true in the overall i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole i sort of feel that way that's right i feel it when they especially when someone they they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for or something like that and you know i say well you know voting for the lesser of two evils is still important i think it is too sometimes it is a difficult choice you don't feel as though you have much of a choice but yeah yeah i mean you i mean it's it's funny because technically you do i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate but of course that's that's not really a vote it doesn't really gain anything um yes it really really doesn't and so it's it's a complicated situation but i would like to see i don't know i i i'm i'm thinking of actually moving to Australia and and perhaps perhaps i'll call you back and let you know what how the Australian system works i mean not because of the vote i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting but just because of a job opportunity and uh i is that girl now because oh i see i'm interested are you a TI employee i'm interested not okay i just wondered i no i'm not and uh so i'm i'm really quite quite curious how that would work to have both i mean you know and i believe in the in a certain uh Soviet block countries you are are obliged to vote too in fact it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for up until fairly recently and that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote but when you actually really are given as much choice as you are in this country with its two party system um i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty well uh maybe they should um perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age required to register and vote for four years and perhaps um-hum um-hum um-hum they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty uh-huh uh-huh well that's a thought or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have i don't know the right to write your maybe it should go with a drivers license yeah that's see that's an example of a right not a not a actually that's considered a privilege not a right that is a privilege right yeah but technically people most people technically it's a privilege but most people think of it as a right i mean in other words if the government denies you driving denies you a drivers license people get very upset but actually it's a privilege which is allowed to be revoked it is that's correct and fortunately voting isn't that maybe it should maybe it should be except well except if you're a felon if you're a felon it is taken away from you i mean they will take away your right to vote under certain circumstances uh-huh that's right uh so gosh so we don't have a great solution yet do we that's don't have a great i i think i checked that as a question i'd be willing to discuss too but i i also i also i don't know if you've uh read any of the um oh what do they call those the uh the early republican uh republic documents uh when they were arguing through constitutional law written by Hamilton and all those people um oh Hamilton i think it was Hamilton who wrote number ten or something where he was arguing for a republican no no i haven't not in the sense of the Republican party now versus a democratic uh government and arguing successfully why the United States should be a republic not a democracy right which indeed it really is a republic not a democracy where he defines democracy democracy as everyone votes for the issues and a republic is people vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues so as you vote for representatives uh-huh and the whole idea was um presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person and and a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy because just as you can have a tyranny of a single um you know bad ruler or something you can have a tyranny of the majority uh-huh and uh he makes a very uh passionate good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process because anytime you have a majority um they can change the law in a democratic a fully democratic process and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case um oh you know a candidate if there's some minority that people don't like because of you know racial hatred or something like that the majority can just simply vote again vote against them and cases like that he argues need to be constrained and and actually i agree right except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote sometimes i think we have that right now with Congress yeah well i i mean i feel that i think they're looking after their own my you know self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country yeah well their job is to be reelected by in large and so they work on that job and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country you know where government is misspending your dollars and and they're all fools and you know throw throw the bastards out that kind of thing and there's a notion that somehow right yeah if someone isn't as much as a government person they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange because i mean if i'm hiring a plumber i want a real plumber i want someone trained in in it i'm very like  so how do you feel about the metric system oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths uh yeah and it's i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think what's interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches uh yeah yeah do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab and tenths of inches are are normal and you know metric you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle and and i've had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me i think it's interesting you went you know when you you go out there and you're looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger i've got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds but my right well now that one's fairly easy because that's probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh don't translate yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it yeah and and you've got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well anyway i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't i don't know do you do you drink adult beverages yeah i drink beer well that have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of yeah whiskey is in liters yes and and the next yeah point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters yeah it's like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange yeah what's a fifth of whiskey yeah i i always wondered about that myself it was a marketing ploy and and they had quarts at the same time though yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and um it was simply a ploy to to get people you know yeah to buy to buy more for it's uh i find that interesting but it's like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in it's liters one one liter bottles and um i i think it's kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not i can i'm not conversant in saying you know that's three centimeters away i mean or or or yeah it it's like i say i work in a machine shop and uh everything's still inches yeah and everything's still fractions of inches or parts or tenths or thousandths or or yeah it's it's hard to think though yes it is a mental thing it is a conversion thing it's like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive bond wire on on semiconductor devices right and well what's a mill and yeah yeah but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric we have a eighty nine Chevy Blazer and before that we had a Horizon uh you know Plymouth Horizon yeah and both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric don't you find that interesting uh that they that that they're doing that uh in any field for how why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada oh okay and the starter was Bosch American so the bolts were were English were were English then yeah yeah it was it was annoying one one half of the starter was you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were American and one of them was metric now that's strange and uh you go from the uh water pump up to the radiator and on the water pump it was all metric and and on you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh yeah uh-huh screw lock uh yeah uh radiator hose clamps essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um you know it's like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches when when you're milling something yeah uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measure or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you it to see if it's accurate and right it's it's not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car and no yeah and you go to look at it and you don't know which set to reach in American or metric yeah and and you're never quite sure well is that a metric bolt you get you a pair of metric pliers right and you beat on it and a metric hammer right right it it can be annoying and my other concern concern is is the American government going to force us to go oh i think i don't think so i i think that that uh i think they've now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know it's a hundred meter oh absolutely and uh uh but automobile races if it i don't think they'd ever it's still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred they're not going to yeah yeah they're not going to change that to meters it will always be yeah and and it i i don't think it i don't you know i don't think i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality uh you it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold how many ounces of gold you know i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header twelve and and they're trying to think of what's a Troy ounce yeah there's twelve troy ounces to the pound yeah now that makes you know yeah and and is that going to change too well i mean and and then there's a metric ton and then there's a ton but what's a metric ton uh see i don't remember i i read it i don't know and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter it's all metric all ready yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i don't know it's uh and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce i don't know and and but you know when you go to the store and and you're trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this one's uh uh three pounds um and you and the other one's yeah two point one keys and and you're you're lost that's right and and i don't know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think they've got i think there are more pressing problems oh yeah the economy uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh yes a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling personal tools to be able to do his job yeah but but are are the tools that uh if you're cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for that for set up uh tools for set up and for measurement uh you got to have a one tenth indicator it's a hundred dollars uh five tenths indicator uh usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each uh five tenths indicator huh at about a hundred dollars you got to have uh six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars uh one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars a two to three for eighty dollars a three to four for eighty dollars so you've got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools real fast yes real real fast edge finders and but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning well i know because okay your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches yeah you know but when you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there what size hole yeah yeah as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole yeah and and what but the thing is then you've got to with screws and that's the other issue uh the pitch and yeah yeah well and thread  okay um i was just trying to think about how i how i dress for work you know TI is a very casual atmosphere uh-huh and uh what i usually do on the weekend is is lay out five outfits and uh on Monday i i wear the the worst looking one because it doesn't seem like people are really are you know are that alive on Monday you know so yeah and then progressively through the week i'll i'll wear nicer looking things and then on Friday most everybody wears jeans jeans and sweatshirts or you know jeans and blouses or something like that uh but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or you know skirts and uh pullover sweaters or uh you know little two piece dress suits suits like but yeah uh you know that's a good way to approach it i've never thought about um i do plan my clothes a week in advance actually i plan them a month in advance i usually do a month at a time so i don't repeat an outfit um-hum uh-huh but um i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on Monday because really no one's paying attention but anyway um i really i don't work outside of school um i work in the computer lab at school so i can just wear whatever i have on for school and and um and really it's i try to dress dress presentable but very comfortable right like um in the warm weather it's always shorts and a T-shirt or a button up or something like that and then in the winter time it's jeans or or pants i usually um you know college is so casual you really don't want to dress up unless you you uh have a job and you have to be there right after school or something like that right like where i work it's it's pretty casual um so it's it's i guess it's more like a a college campus also i mean there's hundreds you know hundreds of people work for TI yeah and um a lot of people just just wear jeans and and uh sweats all the time and they dress up like when customers are coming in or uh when we have department meetings or something like that and um you know a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for their the real um higher ups like the the lawyers the TI lawyers and uh um-hum those that work for the the higher executives those secretaries they uh they really dress up all the time so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time you know oh well that's good that they're so casual i mean uh my brother works for TI and he's a computer programmer or computer engineer yeah uh-huh uh-huh and um you know whenever he was going to school he was expecting to having to wear uh a tie or a dress shirt everyday but uh he goes to work in his blue jeans T-shirt and tennis shoes and he just loves it uh-huh and that's very acceptable at TI i believe at IBM they they make you wear a blue suit and uh some kind of colored shirt and a tie yeah that's what i've heard uh-huh i would i would hate to be in that atmosphere but uh i mean they they just moved into the new building he calls it the new building i don't know it's where all the executives are uh-huh and um and so they were they were going to try to take their blue jean code with them and trying to get all the all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans but he just left for Italy today at four uh oh and he'll be over there until July first setting up some kind of computers for them i see over in TI mean for TI but over in Italy uh yeah oh TI is everywhere oh yeah he was so excited about going uh-huh but uh he didn't carry any ties or anything because he he just went over there with the that attitude well if i don't take it then they won't make me wear it because uh he just that's true that's a good idea he didn't you know he's not really into all that he would wear it if he had to for his job and all but you know if he had the preference i mean his his preference is um blue jeans and a T-shirt so uh-huh but i think that's great about TI and also uh to get off the clothing the smokers you know how they have the the different designated areas for smokers and stuff i think that's great the no right yeah and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke smoke area and you don't smoke you almost strangle oh really do you smoke because there is so much smoke in the air yeah areas the smoking area you know it's closed in and if you don't if you don't smoke and you go in there that everybody that goes in there smokes so it's full of smoke when when you go in there uh-huh i think that's um i used to smoke a long time ago i used to burn my clothes talking about getting back to clothes i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes that's one of the reason that i stopped well um you you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions and uh yeah she always had uh yeah she always had to have a lot of clothes see that's how that's how i am but my mama was not raised like that and so uh-huh no i i wasn't either she my daughter um she's real good at finding sales though you know she she she'll buy a lot of she yeah she'll buy a lot clothes at the end of seasons you know and uh just have them for the next year oh me to boy i have to hunt hunt them down uh-huh and she you know she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and uh buys clothes um when you know when they were coming up i i didn't sew but now i've i've learned how to sew so i'm well i'm i'm still learning how but i'm getting and i'm getting much better at it and i that's great i'm going to be able to make my own clothes i wanted to take a sewing class at school but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet but that i mean that can really benefit right um that's something that i'd be very interested in very interested in learning right because clothes are some are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about uh they're outrageous say ten dollars at you know at at the most out of a decent fabric uh-huh boy runs you like twenty something dollars in the store yeah it's it's marked up just a little shell to go under a suit you know it is it is really outrageous but uh i mean like whenever i i was growing up and all my mom i never understood this then but i do now but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars or uh-huh um or she wouldn't buy me the fifty dollar tennis shoes and stuff like that and she always told me it was because i was still growing and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week right especially to to pay that kind of money for it yeah i have a friend who um she had a she had a baby a little boy and uh she she used to dress him out of Neiman Marcus i mean she dressed him oh no oh fabulously and then seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff and she finally learned that you just can not do this you know um-hum so now she finds the basement sales and just like you know everybody else that's the best way to shop i mean i always thought my mom was being mean to me but i look back at it now and my child is going to i mean i'm going to raise mine the same way right um i don't know i just ah they're just so outrageously priced it's just incredible i try to uh always catch the sales yes and yourself right always and yeah and you just have to keep buying them you know if you if you if you're not buying the most expensive clothes out there the the quality is really not that great you know for the price that you pay yeah it it depends on um yeah there's there's always a reason why they're on sale right so that that has a lot to do with it right but um like i bought i bought the most well beautiful sweater uh sweater from uh i believe it was Ross Dress For Less and it was it was really pretty it was just you know it was just plain a plain uh round you know round uh necked uh sweater sweater uh-huh and it had uh like it was embellished around the the top you know it had uh leather leather designs and um some other other little things on it and i just thought it was so pretty and i got i got it at a real good price i think maybe it was nine ninety nine or something and it was so pretty oh that's great and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was huh oh why it was it was so cheap there was in the middle of the back of it there was it's like there it had been slit and they had like just sewed it back together oh no right in the middle of the the back you know wasn't a seam or anything you know uh-huh and that's why it was so cheap although it's not it's not really noticeable um from the outside but but still it's you know it's really not not not a good quality and then i was told by somebody that works for JC Penney's that um Ross Ross is just one of those places that sells sells seconds the defect yeah yeah um they don't really buy the first quality they buy the second and uh places like JC Penney's that they'll reject the seconds they'll send them back every time but uh-huh places like Ross Dress For Less and uh TJ Max um uh-huh TJ Max does that yeah we have a TJ Max over here and um  well i've been sort of out of it for a little while so i don't know really what's going on well there there's been some interesting stuff going on locally but i suppose nationally the big thing is probably uh the reaction to the war in the Gulf yeah all the Democrats trying to show that yeah oh oh gosh we really did support it i mean just because we wanted to impeach him doesn't mean anything trying to cover themselves yeah yeah there's been uh same thing locally here a couple of uh we got a Senator who uh went on national TV and said that you know if Bush tried to do anything over there without Congressional approval they should impeach him and yeah that's true there there's a lot of talk over there that i don't think anyone imagined that it could possibly be as as successful and and painless as it had been then yeah yeah so they figured a little bit of opposition was safe but it didn't turn out that way sure no uh i don't know i i i usually don't talk politics with people especially strangers because it's a good way to get into an argument but well that's why that's why being strangers is safe we can it's it's probably safer at least now can't get hit this way you know that's true that's true but uh i i don't know i'm i've been Republican for as long as i can remember and the Democrats are just so disorganized and they have been that's true i i've been Democrat for since i've been voting which isn't that long but i'll agree with you there that there's not much organization going on yeah they uh yeah i i don't know it right around the turn of uh oh gosh i should say the eighties now now it's already the nineties i forgot i forget that too um-hum they they just haven't seemed to been able to hit anything uh on the head every every time they go one way the wind is always blowing the other which is well that's true but i suppose it's hard to judge from the eighties because um Reagan was just so overwhelming to them i think they're seeing some of that unraveling these days but yeah yeah no i don't i don't know how they're going uh i i you know i'm looking i'm looking at the upcoming elections and i'm trying to think who are they going to put up well they've already got uh oh jeez there's there's there's already one candidate that i know of on the Democratic end and i keep thinking there's a second one uh Paul Tsongas oh Tsongas yeah uh out of Massachusetts i think yeah i wouldn't mind him too much he's a pretty good guy he's been around and he's he keeps a low profile and doesn't go after the the headlines and stuff um-hum uh i've i've i've heard the name but that that's the extent of my my information about him yeah yeah i i would be interested to see if Sam Nunn decides to go this time i i um-hum try to get the conservative candidate for once yeah i mean if out out of all the Democrats that i could think to run i would he is one that i would i would definitely like to see that that would be interesting i i must admit i haven't been really enthusiastic about the Democratic entrants in the last couple of run throughs well i'll tell you if they if they do it like they did uh the last time around it's not going to be very exciting you know um i mean let's face Dukakis and Bentsen and Bentsen good grief surely they could have done better than that course they they had a they had themselves between a rock and a hard place they had on the one hand they had Jesse Jackson with all that support and on the other they knew very but completely unelectable and oh sure and and they could not give him the nomination true it's it's probably their their their troubles probably stem from the fact that they're such a diverse party uh i yeah and the nominating rules these days are so um pseudo democratic i guess um-hum you can't have the people in the back rooms deciding well who could we really get elected instead there's so much yeah i mean i mean they were really stuck because here they were everybody was expecting Jesse Jesse to get at least the VP nomination um-hum uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly VP and here they are they they know very well they can't do it because if they do it's going to split the party and if they do it they're going to alienate a whole bunch of others so i mean they were stuck one way or the other yeah it was an interesting thing i was laughing through the whole thing uh true i suppose being on the other side of the aisle it probably made good comic theater yeah i it it it was it was it was comical i i sat there and watched the just watched CNN and just giggle all night you know uh oh this is great George Bush is in yeah that's true that's true and i think Bush has turned out to be a lot better President than people gave him credit for i i must admit i'm i'm still i i still find him a little uninspiring he he seems like a reasonably competent yeah he is he yeah he he is person to sort of do do some caretaking to um yeah and and i i wonder the you know if if that's i mean that that really that really should be all we need in a president someone who is capable of managing true and that's all a president is anyway just a manager sort of set the agenda and and let let people do the work it's it's unfortunate how how little domestic agenda he uh and set the agenda and yeah well you know the Republicans Republicans have always been weak on on the domestic side they're they're very big on international stuff but domestically they they just say well it'll take care of itself he he worries about true but uh so many of his compi campaign promises were on the the domestic promises but it's yeah well you know same old you know take it with a grain of salt stuff you know he he true that that's that's what just amazes me though is that that so many people do uh take the campaign promises seriously yeah yeah and they still do he well the the one thing that just amazed me in in Texas here there were a series of um ads saying don't vote for Dukakis he's going to take away your right to own a gun he's going to close down defense plants he's going to do this he's going to do that um-hum um-hum half of which is coming true yeah and i just here's my chance to giggle boy it's a good thing we didn't elect that Dukakis guy because i mean yeah well you know the interesting thing about i don't know if you've been watching Massachusetts lately um i know i know that the the Massachusetts miracle has has gone bust oh it's a disaster it's a disaster and the thing was it was all quick fixes finger in the dike sort of thing to make him look good for the upcoming race um-hum oh i i guess i didn't hear that i didn't go over it really well i mean that that's what you can infer from it because it it's amazing that it started about two years before the the the run true true i suppose and then you know it took a few years to crap out but i mean it was dying last year i lived up in Boston um-hum and i mean it was terrible it was absolutely terrible up prices are just unbelievable up there and the services are getting terrible everything's going down the tubes said he was going to clean up Boston Harbor and it's dirtier than it ever was yeah that really is disappointing it's it's sort of never yeah and then on the other hand too while he was out busy running for the presidential thing the legislature was having their own way um-hum and uh you know it was just it was a pure disaster because the way it was set up he's the one that that put it together and he's the only one who knew how it worked or supposedly worked and he wasn't there to run it um-hum and so here's a bunch of legislatures with their own agenda uh legislators with their own agenda and of course the thing just fell apart fell to pieces and he couldn't do anything with it it was amazing they had a poll last year about i guess it was around July uh they showed the picture of Dukakis to people in Massachusetts only twenty three percent could recognize him as governor that's incredible oh oh there's there's one thing i've got to ask you about the the dump Quayle movement i find that interesting it it was i wish they would i i find him such an embarrassment and uh i mean the the the idea of Collin Powell well he's so powerful or he's so popular now yeah i yeah i i i don't know if he's the the right one to replace him he'd probably be a perfectly competent replacement but boy i tell you he i'll tell you what you know when i was in the Air Force i met i met Collin Powell really yeah i was i had a pretty neat job i got to meet all the big wigs used to fly with the president and all that stuff um Collin Powell is one capable guy i get i i i would probably find him an order of magnitude more capable than Quayle he oh yes absolutely i i mean the it's it's interesting to hear that Bush has instead instead instead instead of just making bland uh pronouncements about having no plans to change the ticket has just really emphatically come out and said no way i know i and i i'll tell you you know it i i my my degree was in political science because i enjoyed it um-hum and i had a good time during that during that election but it floored me when he came up with Quayle because there are so many other capable Republicans well from from some of the things i've heard about Bush he he he didn't want a vice president that was any competition for him i mean yeah and i mean certainly he wasn't going to take Bob Dole on and not that Bob Dole would even take the position i mean he'd be giving up more than he'd gain um-hum but there are several people who are who are just super capable but to get this nobody with the kind of baggage that he's carrying um-hum i uh it just astounded me i mean he must have been so sure of winning that it didn't make any difference well it uh uh i'm i guess i'm the i'm cloudy on the timing but there there was quite a while when his certain victory wasn't certain at all yeah i well i'm i'm not sure how that timing related to the Quayle announcement but he was trailing at at times or or just just neck and neck i guess yeah i yeah about that time i think it was neck and neck and i the only the only reason at the time that i could think of was that he was young and and sort of charismatic in uh in uh handsome sort of way um-hum and hoping to bring in maybe a little bit of like Kennedy charisma or something but the guy is so uncharismatic i mean i mean Bush talks about he doesn't like broccoli well that's how how i think of Dan Quayle as broccoli you know oh that brings up another subject it's the the the uh i don't know the  so what do you think about it well uh i've noticed some changes over the past uh thirty years um for the worst i would assume that that it's gotten worse yeah i can remember uh back in the early sixties when i first started flying a light plane it was quite common for me to take off from uh local airport here and see the uh Appalachian mountains and the Chesapeake Bay at the same time uh-huh and in the you know fifteen years later it was a rare occasion that i could see both at the same time uh-huh you're probably lucky to see the end of the runway by now yeah i know uh lot of times when i was coming back home i would uh file instrument flight plan just to get into the Washington area um but i counted on North Carolina having some good weather for me well i'll tell you i don't know i i don't know whether i i i count the stink as part of air pollution and it stinks down here well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh it depends on where you are now if you're over then you get down wind of a paper mill once in a while yeah if you if you're over by Asheville you're pretty good because you're up there in the mountains and you've got some nice ozone and all that over here in Raleigh it's kind of flat and stagnant and just yucky um it's fine over on the coast because you've got the you've got the breezes off the off the water there yeah but uh seems like it's just dull and uninspiring here well i'm not sure that we're going to be able to uh solve much of the problem no i don't know they're they keep doing things and it doesn't seem to be doing any good i was i was really amazed because i never would have expected you know this problem somewhere like in Atlanta uh-huh and i drove through Atlanta uh couple of weeks ago and it was unseasonably warm and you could see the smog just sitting on top of the city yeah and when i drove through i it it was terrible i i had to keep the windows up uh-huh it was just so thick and uh heavy uh i couldn't believe it i because i mean i used to live in Atlanta years ago and it was always fairly clean i mean you you always you didn't have problem with stagnant air like like LA does uh-huh but boy it was really bad that day and it well one of the reactions i have is that uh they put so much emphasis on the private automobile yeah uh as being a major source of pollution and they've uh ignored the trucks entirely yeah right so i i get to going down the expressway in the morning and uh i don't see very many cars smoking but you see all these all these trucks belching out this black smoke but then i i get surrounded by twenty or forty trucks and they're just laying out a pall of black smoke yeah i know it's i i i i don't understand where the priority is it's uh like in Atlanta they have um they have mandatory catalytic converter inspections yeah there's only three places in Georgia that requires that and uh even with that it hasn't done any good yeah i mean obviously it's gotten a lot worse but you know just like you say you go through there and you watch all these trucks and they're just coughing out all kinds of stuff some of them spitting it out so thick you can't even see past it uh-huh yeah you know i don't know yeah i know along route sixty six the uh people who have residences there uh they can't paint their houses without cleaning them first uh-huh yeah because of the stuff settles on it uh if they're within a block of a major expressway the houses get coated with oil yeah yeah i don't know things like you know well like acid rain and all these sulphur dioxides being dumped out there i i'm more worried about that than i am just about anything else yeah because uh uh it's it's all i mean it's just like it's just like a big avalanche you know you start putting sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere and you end up with acid rain acid rain kills the trees trees don't scrub the air and there you are uh-huh and then of course you've got all these folks cutting down on the rain forest as quick as they can yeah i'm not sure that we're not seeing some of the effects of that already i wonder too you know they keep talking about ozone depletion and all this it it seems funny that it's coming around at the time when we're losing the most most of the forests uh-huh because i i i think that a lot of the pollutants and stuff are being taken out of the air uh you know by the plants and the trees and all that good stuff and here we are losing it and now the now it doesn't have any where to go yeah but ozone well we've sort of been seeing a little climatic shift here on the East Coast or at least it seems that way that uh the winters have been milder for the last five years and uh uh-huh yeah well it's like our winter here i mean it was the winter that wasn't you know we were having having hot days in December and January yeah and got in yeah the first the first winter i moved out here i had a big snow plow on the tractor and i had to use it we had three uh fourteen inch uh snows uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and i haven't used it since yeah you might you might as well sell it for scrap or something because you probably never will use it it's a shame too because i miss all the cold weather i i enjoy winter and at the same time i i see some colder winters in the Midwest i think they've gotten more snow in the past five years than we're having here on the East Coast yeah yeah well it was an interesting day the other day uh i think it was um yeah it was last not not this past Friday but Friday a week ago yeah we had i don't know i think you had some bad weather up there too we had tornadoes and everything down here uh-huh um that was the most historic weather day in recorded history for severe weather in the country oh i didn't know that on that one day i mean you know of course you always have severe weather somewhere but there was more of it on that one day than ever recorded before over four hundred reports of tornadoes hail and heavy winds huh amazing it's a little bit scary well it may have been uh the fact we had this early season warm spell yeah that did that because i know that the the preceding the preceding day Thursday i got my first sunburn for the season out on uh Ocean City Beach um i read an article a couple weeks ago they were talking about uh talking again about the ozone layer they said that the uh the ozone deteriorate is greater than they had originally thought over some of the major metropolitan areas that's a little bit scary to think about because that's certainly not going to improve things around there yes i didn't notice that uh know that they'd discovered any thinness or over metro metro areas i'd only heard about the uh North and South Pole yeah well that's that's yeah that had that had been the thing that had always i mean i i i have always thought about the ozone layer as sort of like a layer and it would move around i didn't know that the hole just stayed there you know i guess i i don't i'm not that much of a meteorologist but uh yeah i was a little surprised at that too because up to that point all i'd heard about was the one over the pole yeah and i said well i'm not too awfully concerned about that if it's going to start melting the ice cap it's not going to be for a long time yet but opening opening up over major metropolitan areas now that's uh that's yeah that that doesn't uh fit my picture of uh of uh meteorology i can understand the Poles because they're uh a permanent high pressure area yeah yeah and uh you know there isn't that much uh circulation but uh the temperate zone is uh a constant moving uh wind system yeah course the ozone is up there so and it's i'm surprised that the ozone doesn't have it's own wind pattern yeah i i mean didn't i don't even know i don't even know if the ozone layer does move i mean apparently it doesn't but of course it it might be just a couple of scientists trying to get their name in the paper sort of like cold fusion yeah cold fusion right the same thought flashed in my mind yeah i'll tell you i i was real excited when i first heard that i said hot dog they finally did it you know yeah i uh i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news um i too and uh everybody wanted to know why i was so excited and i tried to explain to them i mean i'm yeah i mean i'm an old science fiction buff from way back when i was a little boy and this is the kind of stuff that science fiction was made out of yeah uh-huh and it's the days that i keep looking for that aren't going to happen in my lifetime but you know we're supposed to have moon colonies by now but uh yeah cold fusion would have been great yeah could have gone might have started making a little inroads on air pollution with that i think so but who knows except we might have uh bad case of paladium poisoning now yeah yeah there's there's always a drawback to everything i mean i don't know well i know there was uh a pipeline going in up in uh southern Pennsylvania and there was a group in uh Bucks county that was fighting it and uh one of the women that was leading the group said well they say they're going to pump uh oil through there but before long they'll be pumping radioactivity through it okay  well thanks for being home uh on the weekend i uh i'm actually working at night and uh there very few people that are on the list for calls uh on the weekends nights uh-huh yeah well sometimes i'm home and sometimes i'm not but if i am it's always fun to talk are are you part of the school system out there i am as a matter of fact i'm at uh North Carolina State uh the reason i said that because i've had about uh three calls and my daughter had one too from different students out of North Carolina i guess they pass the names amongst your computer students or whatever yeah i think i was the one who did that actually oh is that right great great yeah i had a uh i teach a course in Voice I O Systems oh is that right that's wonderful so i know uh you know i know about this project so i got my students to sign up and uh apparently a number of them have been participating oh yeah i talked to one we're not on the subject of course i talked to one i think he had a whole bunch of calls he had a roommate that had calls and everything he had way more twice as many calls as as i've made uh uh-huh and i i'm of course we at TI just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will uh sell like gang books busters busters really yeah okay you first on the subject what what do you think about Latin America uh let's see the subject is Latin America Latin America yeah i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that i actually was was planning a trip to Latin America and i got warned off by some people they say Peru can't be traveled to and the crime rate in Brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth oh really TI had a place i'm not to sure i don't think they do anymore down i think it was Campinas i'm not sure and uh i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry or whatever and they had quite a few locations not quite a few several uh in Latin America i think the one in Mexico is closed and i think the one in Brazil is closed but i i don't know why that is a problem down there and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too and uh and some people say go to New York but i don't i don't have an answer to the crime rate it's sad that is a sad situation i i'd like to go down to Mexico you know and i keep hearing that you know the government and and the crime rates pretty high too that that is sad yeah uh not that we can uh sell any great program we have with crime but uh i think uh i'm kind of like you i don't have any strong opinions on it i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our our neighbors down there is that we don't have any we have more i guess ties we in the United States have more ties to Europe and everything and we don't really aren't that close to everyone in South America i don't really know why though yeah i i don't understand it either although i i think a lot of South Americans regard the United States as as bullying and uh that's certainly from a historical point of view would be true i mean certainly we took far more from Mexico than Saddam Hussein ever dreamed of taking in in his wildest dreams from his neighbors right right yeah i know that i saw in a book i was reading a Spanish book uh not that i read Spanish you know i just you know reading some Spanish words and there was a comment in there about the Mexicans don't really want us to say we're Americans they would like to say that we're North Americans because they're Americans too you know and i guess that's true we don't think of any one else but ourselves i guess we're kind of uh the smart asses in the world i suppose uh or of America anyway we think of ourselves as the only Americans when they're Americans too yeah well i think they're going to have that's a tough row for them to to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard uh citizens of the United States as Americans and citizens of Mexico as Mexicans and they can stand on their heads if they want too but i don't think that they're going they're going to change that and as Mexicans yes that that no no i know and and really i mean North Americans i think are when you say that even i think i mean i tend to think of Americans and Canadians i just don't think of Mexicans as being North Americans although i guess strictly speaking they are yeah no i mean they were saying that of us that we're the North Americans and they're Americans they they we always say we're Americans and they they want us to say we're the North Americans we're not Americans we're North Americans and they're South Americans yeah oh i see i don't know whatever i i don't want to make i read it somewhere though it's not my point i guess yeah well it's it's so interesting i just i just don't think Mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics no no they they were lucky enough to have some oil what ten years ago an and they they blew all that and borrowed enough more money than they can pay back now and uh uh so they're not exactly business men i do think we should deal more with them i don't i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in Texas uh for the language you know is very foolish i'm relative relatively familiar with Texas school system and we should teach Spanish at least in uh grammar school you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak Spanish i think that helps when you certainly can speak their language uh and there are problems with you know the wet back problem you know for everyone knows what we're talking about when say wet back problem and then we should somehow uh and i think the governments are working on that to try to have some uh businesses uh at the borders of both sides so that you can you don't have this problem of them trying to come up here and to to get the jobs you know there there may be some organized way to do this yeah i i do feel for them uh they are very envious of us or they wouldn't be coming up here you know risking a lot not that they're risking their lives of course but risking a lot uh getting thrown back i guess is all that uh happens yeah you probably don't see that where we see it you know once a month i'm sure in San Antonio they see it more often than that well i grew up in Los Angeles okay well you see it saw it out there then too and uh in fact i drove a cab when i was a graduate student so i i knew uh the Hispanic part of LA pretty well and certainly you know knew that problem knew you know knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that uh-huh and uh yeah it was it was pretty wild i think a a common factor to a lot of problems both whether it be crime if if you want to jump on that is mostly uh poverty uh and i think a lot of their problems is poverty if we could uh uh the problems we have you know in this country is is a lot of it's poverty whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty i that's another story but uh uh it is sad there there's so much down in all of South America uh so much potential you know we're TI of course is is really pushing world markets in their products and they're they're mostly in in Europe now and in in in the Orient Japan and Singapore now just announced building a plant in Singapore uh they're in Taiwan and Japan and they're they haven't had what that much luck in South America and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there for the products certainly that we make and everything yeah and there's got to be trade i guess that's some of the answer i guess is business uh uh and i try to be an optimist and say well that that's one way is to help any problem whether it be crime or certainly poverty obviously is to is to get some business going between each other and we need we need to do more of that uh somehow and encourage more business between us yeah they've got to have a lot of resources i would think an enormous amount of of well potential that way a lot of it of course is hot and jungle and all that but uh there's got to be a lot of potential down there yeah what are what are you taking in school i didn't ask you that i'm sorry well i am actually what are you taking in school oh you you're an instructor yeah you're an instructor yeah you said yeah i'm the i'm the teacher i give as it were that's great are you teaching Computer Science what you said what were you saying you were teaching there yeah i'm in Computer Science and uh very interested in voice systems and in speech recognition but of course this project is really one to collect a data base of great great of uh of casual speech uh in an attempt to get some kin d of a model of what speech is like right i of course i work at TI and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time why that isn't enough i mean i'm i'm i'm getting a kick out of the whole program but uh there's going to be i guess thousands i don't know how many thousands or tens of thousands of these recordings and i wonder how they're going to analyze them whether it would be listening to them or analyzing i guess they've got to be analyzing with a a voice recorder some how yeah well they record these and then somebody transcribes them so that they they have uh they have a speech signal and what and what is said uh-huh and they have a they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening and that's uh a big problem in speech recognition right oh yes i know they change with age i know mine changes uh has changed uh although you you never found your your voice echoes in your own head which is makes it different than what it really sounds to other people yeah uh i'm sure singers and professional people know that and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say my God that's that's not obviously that's not me you know yeah but uh i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way uh go ahead you you comment on it yeah i'm glad that you're in the business that i know TI's gotten it with their Speak and Spell and everything i've told my wife that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer you wouldn't have to have a keyboard right you'll be able to just give it commands and i'm sure they have some of that now and not not in computers but a lot of potential of course for handicapped people  i don't know what the the last thing i've done as far as car repairs go is is change oil and filter an and that kind of stuff i haven't gotten really involved in anything uh extensive in car repairs in oh oh probably a year or so i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an Oldsmobile yeah i had a similar thing that i've worked on cars ever since i was uh a kid and that was some time ago but i've gotten to the point where uh the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that uh oh most of the cars i buy i try to buy as simple a car as possible so you know changing the oil changing the spark plugs and most of them now you know you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or yeah i know what you mean yeah they're fuel injected and so there's or fuel injected so there goes the carburetor and if the fuel injection system breaks down there's no way in the world you're going to work on that yeah no there's no way somebody once said uh i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it and a woman asked me what that meant and i said that means that i can't work on it you know they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that uh oh yeah yeah basically that's it the guys average guys can't really go out in the in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs uh yeah i've got uh an eighty four Chevy van that's uh a one ton van with a camper conversion on it yeah it's got the the the good old three fifty standard engine in it regular gas engine and that engine i understand i can i can actually work on that engine absolutely yeah i used to have uh Chevy van it was a short van that had the the three fifty in it yeah uh-hum and basically it it was a motor and you didn't have all the other junk around it and you could get to it to work on it right yeah i had to change the water pump in that here about a year ago and it was really fairly easy take the grill out and the radiator out and you can just stand there and work on it yeah the hardest part about uh water pump changes is getting all the junk off before you can get too it well that's true you're right you know by the time you've finally got down to it i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went well that's kind of the way i was i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together a few years ago i had an Oldsmobile diesel and uh the uh it after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it and uh i bought it when we were living in Lubbock when i came back here i brought the car back here and uh i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i oh yeah found an outfit down here to rebuild it and uh i reinstalled that and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time yeah i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel uh well if you know diesels don't require mechanics they require plumbers well that's true and uh i think the only closest thing i've come to to a diesel is i've worked for a tractor repair shop uh when i was in high school and uh we used to overhaul farm tractors basically yeah and they were nearly all all diesel but as far as cars i've never never been involved with them well the injector nozzle and stuff in you know the big diesel farm tractors you know what are about the size of your thumb and the yeah you can get to them and the ones in in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with well yeah yeah and you can you can get to them well i i've had a lot of good service out of that car but uh uh i finally gave it to my son and he drove it literally into the ground you know he was out at Tech and he he finished it off yeah i'm i guess you're right the the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status i don't know exactly why One of the reasons is i i'm beginning to wonder is where do you get gas at i sure i don't know if it's still uh limited like it was i don't notice it probably because i don't huh what the availability you mean the diesel availability yeah i don't i don't notice but maybe because i'm not looking for it yeah yeah well i'd bought uh a GMC diesel pickup and uh loved that thing you know i really liked it but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really yeah needed and it was the van that i needed then to buying the you know traded it in on the Chevy van but uh sure enjoyed it but you you got the the three fifty in the van yeah yeah the three fifty regular gas engine yeah that's what i like because they've got plenty of power and uh uh-huh if you treat them right they're not the gas guzzlers i think that they've got the reputation to be i'm convinced that uh Detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake years ago when they stopped putting the small V eights in and went to the fours and some of the sixes yeah well uh-huh i'm convinced that the small V eight like the the Mustang's original two eighty nine or some of the Chevy two eighty threes were good little V eight engines that were not gas guzzlers but they had enough power to pull all this weight And the four cylinders just don't have it yeah i think that little the little Chevy V eight when it started out in sixty in fifty five i think was two sixty five something like that little yeah you know not a hold lot more than the than the six cylinder that i think was like about for about two thirty five or something but uh they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a four hundred small block four hundred that was uh the same block you know just just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more yeah i think those guys those little V eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines if they would have gone with it but yeah well that was uh that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up oh yeah the two little cars i've got now bought a Mitsubishi Mirage here a couple years ago and and it was normally carbureted and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong and you know changing the plugs and stuff yeah yeah that's kind of like the the first well my first car was a fifty six Mustang and uh over the years uh all i had a uh Dodge pickup several years ago and uh i can't remember the size of the engine it was a three O seven or something like that yeah but uh i remember working on those cars you'd open the hood and there was basically nothing in there but an engine and a few things Now you open the hood and it's scary like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah the friend of ours over here he's got uh sixty five or sixty six Mustang with the six cylinder and uh i was look under the hood of that the other day and like you say you can see the road it's amazing yeah well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to you could yeah you could stand in there if you really wanted to i guess my dad's got a new um i guess it's an eighty nine or ninety uh Chrysler something or other it's one those transverse mounted V sixes front wheel drive oh yeah and uh he was showing it to me and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean and you know you can see the three spark plugs there in the front And i said well where are the other three and he had never really thou ght about it And he says well hopefully i won't have to change them before i trade it off Yeah it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall yeah yeah so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them uh-huh yeah well when they went to the started with the newer engines you know when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much you know trouble because the three fifty with all the you know like well actually i guess here within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it the three O five was that that V eight that they put in the the three quarter and and half ton van and it had all the air pump and uh right uh i don't know all that all that stuff and all the antismog stuff and uh boy that was uh really a mess back under there under the in that van yeah the antismog pumps and all that stuff loads the motor down uh-huh uh-huh so it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things but that's one good thing i've got a uh eight ninety uh Chevy Blazer now and it's got one uh belt on it a serpentine belt oh it's that one that's about uh what an inch and a half wide got a bunch of groves in it yeah i haven't had to replace the thing yet it looks like it would be uh better than having i've got an an Olds Tornado that i think's got six belts on the sucker And i had to get all those off you know when i was replace that uh water pump and uh yeah yeah i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where yeah it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck you know when one of them breaks it's not the outside one it's it's the it's usually that power steering belt or something that's way back in there everything's got to come off oh man you bet everything else's got to come off first well it's a pleasure meeting you yeah and we'll uh how many times have you done this now is this uh i've got uh five stickers here from TI so i guess i've done probably uh i'd say seven or eight of them yeah i hadn't uh hadn't not gotten any calls here in the last uh this is the first one in a week or so and yeah i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks so i don't know if if it's tapering off or what i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting uh answers so it sounds it's taken them ten fifteen minutes at a time so if it's winding down or what finding a taker people or either not or maybe they're burned out or they're through with it anyway let you go thanks for talking yeah well okay all righty bye-bye  okay so i think i think what we should talk about is the the war um the war that just went on see i don't agree with it first of all i don't believe in war okay um-hum and then the United States has this attitude by saying you know thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that and i think it's all independent because it's it has nothing to do with the United States you didn't gain anything from it um-hum and it wasn't our freedom that you were saving it was just the thing the thing that that uh that i saw was okay Iraq wants to raise oil prices Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system by leaving them independent um-hum um-hum um-hum and so when Iraq you know saw this they said let's take over the country which is a good idea um-hum right then the United States says okay our our oil prices are going to go up and like for example see okay like Lithuania Lithuania right they declared themselves uh an independent country with a president right um-hum Russia goes in there well the main government in Moscow goes in there and they kick everybody's ass and the United States doesn't go in there and say listen they were uh you know named an independent you know state with a president and everything but we're not going to go into your country um-hum but these countries here which you know are you know like in nineteen eighty four have you ever read that book no huh-uh okay nineteen eighty four there are like three big continents and uh there's just this area like around Egypt and stuff that everybody's fighting over now the problem is is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries um-hum um-hum right like their immediate boundaries like you're not going to go you know it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're you're invading their border right but all the other countries you can fight about um-hum um-hum and so the thing is is that you're wasting so much money to send you know it's like how much money did the US spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being we'll probably never know how much it actually cost and you know it's it was uh basically all based on oil because nobody actually like for example if uh let's say if uh you know Brazil took over you know Surinam i don't think anybody would care um-hum yep you know and uh that's something that that has been you know very because see the thing is is like every time that i see a war i see myself on the front line and on the other side i see myself again and i got to shoot myself you know i got to shoot somebody that's that's got the same family that i do you know the same relationships that i do and just because i was born here i've got to shoot them down um-hum oh it's never a pleasant thing that's true and uh but at least it was it was over quick and there weren't that many deaths now the only problem is is the aftermath that you're having so many deaths in the border with uh Turkey yes that's amazing yes yes that's really unfortunate it really is i don't know if we stopped too soon i don't i don't i really don't know what we need to do about that and uh well there's there's something that that the US did right which is say say you know okay let's kick him out of Kuwait which was our basic goal um-hum and uh now indirectly let's try to overthrow him um-hum you know and they're not going to do that directly but the thing is is that they they didn't go into into Iraq and say you know because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country you know you can seek seek asylum here and you can go there but no way are you going to rule ever again um-hum yeah um-hum i've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on you know criminal charges i don't know if that will ever happen or not well the thing is is that first of all they got to they got they have to get him uh-huh which is very difficult to do and and there's no way that you can get him unless it's by force um-hum you know and then you can put him on trial obviously he's not going to turn himself in no no i think i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in because there's i mean there's like it's like there's no hope you know like what Hitler did you know like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life but where um-hum true yeah you know and so um the thing is is that once you've done something wrong which is nationally you know internationally recognized then you're going to try to get out of it and the there's no way you know and especially since he's got inside Iraq for using you know chemical weapons and stuff yeah true um-hum and you know like he sent planes over to to shoot the people down that were on the border with uh that that were on their way to Turkey um-hum he had a couple of them bombarded yeah yeah obviously human life means nothing to him um-hum but uh you know he's got uh millions of dollars like oh yeah fifty i think it was like i don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million which is really doesn't make any difference that's true past a point it doesn't make any difference yeah yeah that's really really unfortunate it really is and but it's just it's just that uh you know it you know like the we just put our goals in different you know levels is like saying you know it's like yeah sure we need oil you know and we need it desperately um-hum um-hum yep but the other countries that you know that have oil but not as big you know like they say you know like when the prices went up and then they went down when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia or something um-hum um-hum seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally though before the before the increase started well the it it's an advantage you know it's like you're saying okay i can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon um-hum and i'm not going to bring them back down to you know ninety nine cents why because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon um-hum um-hum so if i ten leave it at a dollar ten people are still going to pay true you know i went down forty cents but i went up ten cents um-hum yep you know about the lowest i've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is uh i guess about ninety two point nine now ninety eight ninety two oh God here it's like it's like a dollar five yeah oh really well there's still a lot of dollar five places around here but you can find some that's under a dollar but not not a whole lot that's the lowest i've seen but still the i mean have you ever checked like uh the most money makers in uh in nin eteen uh ninety uh you can see that uh Exxon and Amaco and uh other companies oh God i forgot their names but uh Exxon was the number one money maker and that was just because of of the last quarter um-hum um-hum right i think Mobil's doing very well too well i assume i assume all the major major brands are yeah and uh that was i mean and one of the companies uh went up four hundred and some percent um-hum and that's practically impossible to do now a days for a company to to shoot up in that way and uh that's true yeah yeah it's just that you know people people take advantage take advantage of that you know like the the companies were saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when you know when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for we've got to raise our prices um-hum you know but still if you realize that uh one barrel has like how much was it like uh forty gallons yeah something like yeah something it's got forty gallons and they're selling you know you you know you you got to pay forty dollars at least and you know for uh for one gallon and it's it was selling like at twenty five or something yeah um-hum so you're making uh you know fifteen dollars profit easily yep yep sure and uh everything i mean and and the expenses you know of the war you know it's like uh you know it's like who's gaining on this okay because uh i uh does does the US government own any gas companies like like you know like gas stations and stuff um-hum um-hum um-hum i because see like for example i don't know if the British government owns Shell i'm not sure about that i'm not sure either but the thing is like the US government got nothing out of it um-hum because well you know it's like other the other independent companies the gas stations you know and they did and uh then the taxes go up and then everybody else loses um-hum but um you know they're just they're just some things that might not be worth it yeah that's true you know and and uh first of all how many how many people had to had to die before the war you know it's like transporting stuff and um-hum yeah things like that before you know it's like yeah sure you know like to to a couple people that died there their families don't feel it was necessary to do that yeah yeah you you could never you could never bring them back so oh well sure dead's dead that's true well i don't guess we resolved anything but it's interesting it's yeah so okay nice talking to you to you too take care bye-bye bye-bye  uh i have uh i guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War um i i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on and so there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening yeah um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because i because we never went to war i don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out and i i feel like it went on and on right and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening right you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and i'm not sure that's our role but yeah i i agree with that i was i was fairly young at the time too i i really don't have very many memories about it at all in fact and uh my husband is a Vietnam veteran and i you know he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on he i it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time i mean i do think that i i it's been too long in coming but i feel like maybe the American people and and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that that those so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty right that's right i mean they weren't there by choice and and i think yeah and i i think that we learned from that and i think it it's one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe that's just now turning around right turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and i'm and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people right no i don't think you can and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war i mean they're still not settled over there no they're not and i have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way yeah i think we're going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner well i i appreciate the feel i feel like President Bush is in a hard spot he went over there to get them out of Kuwait which he did and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize they're still saying well here you're encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why aren't you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation i think it would too and i don't think the US will stand for it i don't think he would do that uh i think we learned too much no yeah i agree with that of the effects uh you know whether it was justified or not i know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism but uh-huh but i think somewhere that got lost you know in the long term effects of the of the war and yeah yeah well you have to i you know you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he he said that's what we were going there to do and he did what what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action yeah uh or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really can't do as as another country yeah i mean that my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address that we don't get fixed that's right and and that's that's what frustrates me more than anything i know and i i believe that we have to have a military and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us right but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward i think there's a lot of waste and and they don't i if they could just cut out all the fat and and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway i know i do think that in the Middle East war um i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude uh-huh uh i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more right and uh and i think that's good you know i think that's a good yeah yeah a lot of good has come from this one i think so too and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war and and and perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam right exactly so i i i do think that we've learned from it uh-huh you know i i i wish there weren't war yeah no kidding but uh i do think we learned and i just i just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid yes for you know uh nothing i mean it was they're they still don't know what they were there for no there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal no no we went in but what did we do we lost lives and and what were we trying to do who knows yeah that's true and i i think you're right uh i think you're right there um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home uh but i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war uh-huh uh yeah there's a lot of people that aren't for war i'm not for war right but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right i don't remember that feeling back in Vietnam right i just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and it's sad and we shouldn't be fighting a war but there was no let's support them you know right well the when this war broke out it frustrated me all this the antiwar people and yeah you know their all the demonstrations that were going on i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity because those kind of people i mean you know they're the kind of people who are w ho've always got to have a cause whether it's good bad of indifferent they've got to have a cause and that's right and i you know nobody says because you're supporting the troops that you're you're supporting the war you you have to support the people that are there that's right that's right and some for some reason those people don't see that they don't see it as supporting the folks the people no no they don't and you know they're just real shallow people i would agree with you there yeah i i agree um and i and i recall when President Bush said that you know he said look i you know i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war there's a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that yeah i mean they're not helping anybody that's the that's the whole point they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves but their not that's true and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves you know uh giving a soapbox to stand on yeah but well i just i i'm glad we've learned i'm sorry we had the experience of Vietnam yeah and uh and i'm i'm i'm especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because you know until the last past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them that's true yeah and and i think that's where we as American people really failed you know failed them yeah so i don't know well do you have anything else you want to say on this no i guess not i think this is the first time that i haven't been cut off by the computer i know we get cut off all the time too usually i can talk all day but this is something to me that's sad yeah it is so well have a good day and i appreciate the conversation thanks same here bye-bye bye-bye  well this is going to be very boring boring because i don't hi you don't at all no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh i'm supposed to i'm way overweight but uh i've had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctor's trying to get my blood pressure under control um-hum before i start in any exercising or too much of it yeah yeah you need so anyway i did join the uh uh the Texans up at uh oh uh-huh uh Springcreek um-hum and i've been up there a few times but didn't accomplish too much because i just run down too quick yeah i haven't been up there um but i understand they've got a nice pool and that's my favorite form of exercise is swimming uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising it's so boring really uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods oh yeah most of my my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old uh-huh and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration exploration hike you know through the neighborhood it's amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and and to a five year old they're they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one it's uh it's a brand new exciting activity for her isn't it amazing um-hum it really is well we um back when my my i have four sons they're all grown now and and two of them are married with children of their own but when they were just uh pre teenagers we um um-hum we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping oh yeah isn't it great and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and and pretty much roughed it sleeping on the ground and all um-hum and uh i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh uh being self-sustaining um-hum uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and they'd they'd exist exist somehow well that's neat my uh my husband was uh was a boy scout and he uh actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in The Order of the Arrow and he absolutely um you know the earth is is part of him and he is part of it and i think that's a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we haven't yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because to them uh or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldn't quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders uh-huh and i'm afraid that if she woke up one with her we would have to pack up and come home so we've primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls up in Oklahoma oh wow well okay that is understandable oh yes i'm very familiar with it very beautiful place isn't that a beautiful place i've been up there several times well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know we'd never seen one oh what a shame or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but she we'd never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet so we weren't concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since but we still go up there and we still have a great time well good i'm glad to hear that about the only thing uh i might suggest is uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isn't frightened um-hum and uh and that that that the the nightmare i'm sure was just a a freak i'll bet it wouldn't happen again i think not yeah i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but sure we uh that's you you know that's our favorite form of exercise is is life and we do our own yard you know we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesn't um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know well that you couldn't pick a better way of doing it with your family well yeah we have a and and you're you're certainly all getting an education while you're doing this exercise that's kind of how we feel about it we can't you know there's there's there's things that uh the only thing that is forever is the earth well we hope it's forever yeah and uh and you know therefore as far as we're concerned it you know the girls can learn things in school about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth there's no other way to really learn it but to experience it um-hum and we really have a great time with it i'm sure that's the way that you felt with your boys oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida oh and Florida's absolutely wonderful for that i understand i've i've never lived there oh yes yes yell they used to be but now they're trying to really put it to the the the uh visitors i think they're doing a very stupid thing oh with Walt Disney World and well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels and hotels um so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they suddenly and suddenly the the foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks people were going elsewhere for uh their vacations by night they were trying to turn it too much into a business exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry oh that's good we've uh not been brave enough yet to brave that trip with these with the two small children i mean you know in the car uh yeah i can appreciate that it's it's uh it's you know getting up to Turner Falls or uh up to Lake Murray is about as far as we've really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh uh gone down to the New Braunfels uh San well we were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio um-hum and uh we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but um you know that's that's pretty much as far as we've tried with little ones well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run um-hum now uh i'm alone now myself and and i i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home oh um-hum well the fact i live in it and there's just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently um-hum and it works out fine i mean i stop i'm never in a hurry to get anywhere and no reason to be like it takes me two days to get to Memphis and that's that's not terribly far no it's uh it's about an eight or nine hour drive really yeah yeah but uh i make it in two days because i i don't push it well there's so many neat places along the way i mean you've got Arkansas you know and oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i can't remember the name of that place there's a beautiful park up there and they do have a uh uh oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge that's what it is um-hum um-hum and it's just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have uh several nature trails it's just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs uh it's just below Hot Springs um okay oh well that wouldn't even be a very far drive it's lake something i'm not i i ought to look into it uh because we were kind of entertaining entertaining the thought of taking a uh you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer um-hum and i well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas uh-huh welcome bureaus um-hum and ask them for their literature on the the uh state national parks in the state of Texas um-hum and you'll you'll get a collection from them the you wouldn't believe there were so many parks in the state i probably wouldn't and i've lived here all of my life well it it there there are so many for instance have you ever been out to Tyler State Park oh yes i have i have been to Tyler that was one place we went when i was a child all all right you we've not taken our children though there's a place to take them and uh oh good heavens up there just this side of Texoma Texoma not Texoma uh Texarkana uh-huh Texarkana uh-huh there are three or four state parks up there we ought to head out we uh and they're all great and and again there's the nature trails um-hum ah for your exercising right we almost forgot our subject of the day there but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bureaus tourist bureaus and get their literature yeah yeah well i certainly will Jack it's been real it's been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i i certainly enjoyed it well it's been my pleasure uh Gina Gina is that with a G okay uh-huh it sure is that's that's uh uh Italian heritage isn't it i don't have any Italian heritage my my mother actually chose it because of Gina  well um what what do you think about the metric system uh do you uh find it usable have you tried much with it well with with an engineering degree it's of course it's a whole lot easier yeah um-hum to use you mean uh-huh because uh yeah if if somebody had is totally unfamiliar with it uh human nature being what it is we don't like to change yes uh it just makes absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal yes and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another um-hum um-hum well i've i've lived both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system and uh so i've i've lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over um the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilometers right uh kilograms and i think that's what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math that's right right right and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and you know and leaving it at that and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but i'm perfectly comfortable using either uh-huh and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know it's hard to take it seriously oh yeah and as long as both were given you basically just don't read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else that's right uh i don't know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and uh that's right it's all their fault well i mean it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um i don't know why they were um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well we're just going to start using the things now and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to of course being part of the European community if everybody else did it they they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us that's true that's that's probably true and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting you know some other model well uh there's an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future i've never heard that one that's very nice oh so i'm all for the metric system and converting over and i think i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers or just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound is a package of dates mind you it's was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound and then in parenthesis it said four hundred and fifty four point six grams right right and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically antimetric propaganda cause anyone who would say well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldn't weigh it out accurately anyway um every time i see something like that i think well that's that's an antimetric argument yep well i i don't think it'll it could ever happen with with a quick transition you don't no i i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is um-hum um-hum i would think it would take probably two or three years before people could could completely cut the cord yeah oh oh that's what i was thinking by quick transition i didn't mean you know i didn't mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything did they switch uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you can't do it gradually that's an example of something you can't do gradually well that's true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction yes it does a quantum leap from left to right hand drive and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and interesting oh yes yeah yeah you know but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate um i'm sure so i i i i i think it's essential that it's done and i think the real trick is to avoid the you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they don't deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact exactly exactly the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really i think well we do have the two liter soda pop bottles uh-huh i saw that i saw that the other day i don't don't drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that yeah are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one right yes that's true well sure have enjoyed our talk yes well get back to what you're doing and i'll do the same i enjoyed talking with you too okay bye-bye okay God bless bye-bye  all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready and then i enjoy uh-huh uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and i have fun uh-huh well uh uh your you said your family was grown uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping take them camping that's when we camped the most when i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families uh-huh because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing uh-huh and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know yeah but even even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isn't it it is isn't it it isn't have what kinds of things have you tried have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking oh oh uh well it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started uh-huh and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper oh yeah because all you needed was a big frying pan you dumped everything in together big frying pan and it was enough for all five of us six of us oh that's interesting you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping uh when my oldest son six of us uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh oh i mean you know he did it up really good and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it well that's great it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove and it works real good it's like an oven uh-huh well just put uh put a thing on it cooking was our secondary interest i mean what did you like to do most well really just commune with nature that's neat isn't it we started out uh well we were living in Florida at the time and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive right i agree so my ex decided we're going to try camping and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent and that's how we got started we did it for years and years uh huh well now in Florida is there is there times are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot well yes uh yes and no i mean um yes in the winter time yes it's it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh there's really no time of the year that you can't go uh-huh oh is that true now now we're we're in Texas now and you're in Texas right uh because yes i'm in Dallas okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water i guess yeah yeah we have done that but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey oh where abouts and we uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick it's just about twelve miles south of the New York border uh-huh and we'd go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast uh also go ahead oh yes yes yes i come i come from up in that area i'm a New Yorker myself oh are you where did you live a little town called Tuckaho over by White Plains oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in White Plains that's a that's a neat area but it's a that is a particularly neat area for camping well that i wouldn't know i left there when i was quite young because yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you don't have to go very far uh-huh and uh and there's uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we uh clipper little clipper sail boat uh-huh and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way well uh me i outgrew uh sleeping bags and uh tents and i now have a motor home oh do you we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and it's fun too i think well i live in mine yes do you that's neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper uh well yes i consider myself what they call a full-timer a full time camper well now are you living alone now or yeah the yes well just me and my dog you and your dog huh hey that sounds great well we don't we don't camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family and yeah oh yes definitely and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life i'd always nothing like the fresh outdoors right i'd always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity good to talk to you tell me your name again Jack uh-huh are you uh from Dallas too Beth Jack all right yes yes we've been here we're we're in Plano but we've been here about uh eighteen years oh well that's where we that's where i am Plano are you are you how about that well we're all lots of people from TI up this way it uh-huh all right good to talk to you all right all right bye-bye nice talking to you too Beth bye  but a lot of women are knowledge as knowledge about football as i am can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too yes uh-huh do you they've had some great games in the past uh-huh i i always enjoy watching this Dallas the Dallas and Pittsburgh together you know uh-huh me too it wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys i'll tell you he lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact does he really well actually it's probably closer to Fort Worth but it's it's in the same area he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas uh-huh uh-huh but he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job oh wow i wonder if he'd ever do that i don't know he'd be good at it he's such a motivator he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do yes uh-huh uh-huh well what about the Houston Oilers do you like them yeah okay i'd love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great uh-huh that may not ever happen i don't know uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams uh-huh and Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now that's right he certainly is he's very good uh-huh he's one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are he's very good that's right Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia i guess last year but he's no longer with the team so you're right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea uh-huh i don't know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better uh-huh but uh i think they still have a little i think they're still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing yeah oh yeah that was just such super team or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again yeah well that's a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years uh-huh that won what four Super Bowls yeah four in a row four in a row i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not oh i don't know shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now so yeah that's right and that's right that's right i think Mike Webster was left but then he he just left uh uh-huh yeah he may have been the last of the old guard i don't know yeah i think he is i think he was yeah they had such a super team uh-huh have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday no i didn't i see huh-uh there's quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few uh of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may may never play a game you just never know it's it's a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know yeah uh-huh well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player ever been uh-huh probably an old guy that played probably before you were born his name was Sam Huff he used to play for the New York Giants oh that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know there's been so many really uh-huh yeah yeah but if i had to pick one i would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact oh you know that's really funny um well i i come from a large family and there there's quite a few boys so that's kind of how i got in with the football either watch that or watch nothing and um uh-huh that's right at one time i could name all the players on the Steelers you know and but even when Bradshaw was playing i i don't know i i didn't particularly care for him i thought he was kind of cocky or something uh-huh uh-huh he is he is of course there a quarterback has a big ego yes uh-huh they really do they have to have they can't survive uh-huh they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up i'll tell you uh-huh yeah him and Franco Harris i really didn't care for the either two of them uh-huh uh-huh i mean they were good but i you know you couldn't deny that but i didn't i thought you know well i just didn't really care for either one of them uh today my favorites out of those guys were probably um oh yeah uh-huh Lambert Ham and uh Stallworth and Swan uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh absolutely i can't disagree with that they were super players they really were they really yeah uh-huh i i i like not just with the Pittsburgh i like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the the best plays from you know from the week or something uh-huh yeah highlights yeah uh-huh yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know uh-huh yeah yeah that's kind of funny too as a matter of fact some of them a a bit embarrassing yeah well they make mistakes too i guess yeah uh-huh it's funny that more people don't get hurt absolutely absolutely you know especially i would say the receivers when they're in the air and they get tackled uh-huh go ahead they take such a beating oh yeah it's funny some of their necks don't get broken absolutely i don't know how they do it it's it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know they're going to get hit it's just a matter of how hard you know or where yeah an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically oh absolutely they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do yeah well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the Bears the refrigerator i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i think i don't know i i'm knowing what you know of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament i'm just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am he's such a he's about a half hot head anyway such a temper oh you know and to me he does um oh he's just so big and fat he doesn't even look like he's in shape he's just so big no one can move him uh-huh that's right yeah absolutely there's just so much mass there i guess they just can't i don't know you know i probably the guy is you know probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess it's just uh-huh like you say a mass that nobody can seem to to get out of the way as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird i don't know Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but yeah he has a terrible weight problem wow they watch the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not you know completely out of control uh-huh but i guess most every team has some has someone like that i don't know oh yeah there's there are some really big guys playing in football absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to to uh-huh know to stay in the game i guess yeah yeah you would uh-huh um now who would you say that you have a favorite i mean other than Dallas would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the the attention you know oh yeah sure well you'd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like Montana i guess who's done so well for so many years yeah i really i i enjoy watching him play yeah his age is about to catch up with him though he's no Spring chicken anymore and like you say Warren Moon's an excellent Warren Moon's an excellent but he's very exciting to watch uh-huh sure uh-huh absolutely no but he's still performing yes he is i i i enjoy watching him also what about uh Marino uh i'm obviously he's a very good quarterback i'd i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know i think he'll get better as he gets older yeah he may uh-huh because he he well was he was the youngest quarterback there was wasn't he yes he was i believe that's right at one point in time yeah but he's a very young fellow yeah uh-huh of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot if he's got a good supporting cast you know if not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway you know well Dallas did better last year hopefully they'll do better this year that's true that's true uh probably around twelve uh-huh yeah um i didn't i don't know i i just think you know Marino will get better and uh his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl you know so uh-huh that's right that's right yeah Miami's had some down years too yeah but they all do i guess it's it's cyclical i guess as the players get older get slower uh-huh yeah that's true yeah and with age comes you know the the i'm sure arthritis sets in with them you know right yeah get slower yeah oh yeah oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah yeah that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game uh-huh and they're so young but they're retired you know and their so young still that's right uh-huh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average uh professional career only lasts seven years so that's when you think about it that's really not a very long time of course oh oh yeah but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years you know yeah a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple that's right yeah that's right yeah holy smokes i didn't that doesn't seem like very long that's that's a pretty short career on average uh-huh of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments they'll you know they'll do all right but a lot of them don't unfortunately uh-huh yeah um what do you think of the uh LA Raiders used to the the Oakland yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws and if their if their you know arrest record won't let able won't let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived yeah you know perception i don't know Al Davis is he's a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy apparently he's kind of a wild guy i don't really know for sure they've had some excellent teams though obviously i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going yes they have uh-huh  so uh what do you think i think we're overtaxed to the hilt yeah yeah i mean we're we're taxed on taxes and um uh most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is i mean we don't have one yet but eventually they may try to push it through oh really so they have no i didn't realize they had no state tax in Texas no no state income tax oh that's great because they don't have it in Florida in New York they have it uh-huh i mean you know like i say i'm in New York and we have a state tax as well so that just cuts even more yeah i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits right i i think that i i mean i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't they don't go to any place you know you you don't see it going to any place where it belongs right i think if it were to be uh if it were to be um if it were to be hold hold on a second please someone just walked in the door yeah if if it were to be spent in the right way i think wouldn't be so upset about it but given that it that it's not spent properly i think it's a major problem well we're really overburdened from federal state and local that it takes such a size out of your paycheck that there's not a whole lot you can always do with your paycheck well that's certainly true well what is it they were just talking about um sort of middle income you know how how middle income people what winds up happening is for instance having kids you know they wind up having kids as a deduction and after but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something uh-huh i think that so they want to you know try and i think they're trying i think that i think that most of the politicians understand this they just don't they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well right and uh i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a a better tax revenue that's fairness and all is for us to limit their terms uh-huh and by doing so they're not obligated to anybody i agree i agree and uh and uh i don't know how we're going to do that right away though but what what in general though that taxes are doing to us is it's just taking uh a bite out of our savings right exactly and then and then uh uh i'm i'm just not sure if i see you know if i see it going like i say to the right places i mean it'd be it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older yeah you know but i'm not convinced that's a that that Social Security is doing as well as it should and you know and and and uh and and that you know those people who need it for welfare and so forth who really need it for welfare not the eighty five to ninety percent of them who don't need it but i mean the real people who really need it you know should be getting it but instead i think it's going to the wrong places and i believe the Social Security tax is a great pondsy scheme you think so yeah it's uh you know right now they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit i know and that scares the hell out of me and i bet that's illegal see if uh most company uh CEOs were to do that within their private company they'd be in jail yeah so how are we letting them get away with it yeah i don't i don't well because because they're the ones who make the laws so who's going to yell at them you know it'd be nice if we sort of as one band together and and uh and an performed a citizens arrest i guess right yeah to see if we could sort of clean them up and you know but i don't know if we can do that or not a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to to oppose a lot of the situations going on in the taxing system i agree i agree but um yeah like like you said i wonder you know if if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process yeah i sort of i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong you know all those things that really could be changed that aren't you know that that aren't and taxes is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list yeah hum so i don't know i i i have no idea what to do about it well there's no quick solution or no sure fire easy answer it's just going to take uh uh really uh uh uh a combination effort i think of the majority of the American people to come to a decisive answer or vote to limit the way it's spent yeah see we we're we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place that's right we don't i mean the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another right and they are controlled or pretty much do what they want to do right i've never quite understood that i've never uh you know even though um i i've never been uh sort of politically minded but it's never been clear to me as to sort of um you know how Congressmen an can can just sort of go ahead and vote their own conscience as their own ideas when clearly their constituency does doesn't back them up on anything you know and often times that will happen well they feel invulnerable invulnerable to uh right any wrath or uh it's it's occurred so many times that they figure people will usually forget and don't think about it when the election time arises right and generally it does work out that way they do forget it's true could because everybody think of what happens is whenever the politician whenever the the one who made that supposed mistake turns around and uh his his or her opponent can say well look they did this and they can turn around and say well my opponent did this uh-huh so it becomes uh a general battle of the who sort of the election of the lesser of two evils yeah i think so i don't know i just uh i'm unhappy with it but and well i'm i'm sort of semi fortunate right now i'm a graduate student so i don't make that much what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school well when you get out into the real world then you will know but it's my my my wife has a real job and you know when i get her job um you know we we look at her paycheck i'm just floored whe n i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep yeah especially around bonus time bonus time you have a bonus bonus she no my my wife does oh my wife i don't no graduate students don't get bonuses we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure uh-huh so you're taxed on the bonuses too right my my wife is taxed on her bonus as well and that's a that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually i mean her bonus isn't that much but they tax it as i i guess they tax it as if uh-huh that were her weekly check or something uh-huh so she gets destroyed on her bonus check uh-huh so she works with in in in sales so a good portion of her you know her salary is is quarterly bonuses uh sales is lucrative but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job yes well yeah she's not entirely sales so it isn't it isn't as lucrative as one would hope but it it keeps us supported temporarily uh-huh until i can get a real salary and then get taxed more so i don't know i don't i guess i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it and hope that it gets better yeah well i have i guess about said what all all i can think of to say same here tough topic so yeah it's really a rather touchy topic at that but i believe i i i do agree with you most most wholeheartedly it's been a pleasure talking with you well that's great you too and uh have a good day thanks for calling you too bye-bye  okay i'll let you go ahead okay i uh i have five children all together oh uh-huh uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve oh that's great i always thought it'd be great to have twins uh yeah if you like doing everything twice well yeah uh at any rate um my first two children uh i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them uh-huh um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh full-time job that was more than a full-time job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and uh so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to your first ones you mean it was this way yeah the yeah the family well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two uh-huh uh-huh because um oh about the time i got out of working that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much you know with all the children around the house it's kind of hard to notice that dad isn't around very much um oh right so what i've tried to do uh now that i've uh finally went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so uh-huh then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so i've tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what i'm currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um uh-huh uh-huh helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights uh-huh and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the movies and uh-huh it's working out pretty well um we're spending more time together i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um uh-huh and in fact i found that i'm a lot closer with uh i have one son who's gone and i don't even know where he's at um he's taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah and and uh my huh that's difficult yeah daughter is um has moved out of the house her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house uh-huh it happens that way and uh so it's it's it's it's been difficult to try to find the time and i think it's important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh a me kind of attitude uh-huh and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and uh-huh um uh-huh you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there Texas is much worst for the drugs i mean it was bad enough every place else but drugs is in Texas are extremely bad yeah and so i think it's kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and i'm doing my best to keep that up uh-huh uh-huh well that's all you can do yeah what's your been your experience well i i was going to ask too does your wife work um she didn't up until the last oh six months uh-huh she just recently started working then uh she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week uh-huh uh-huh huh oh uh-huh uh-huh so that sounds great well uh we also have five children huh and but ours are all out of the nest so uh as when they were growing up i probably we had a lot of similar things like like you had you know having the time when you have younger ones to take care of you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones but uh we were we're very active of course at church and uh Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H yeah uh and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children uh-huh and uh we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasn't expensive and uh our youngest is uh expecting her first baby so they're they're all out and on their own they're and we have one to get married yet and they'll all be married uh and they're they're all doing pretty good they uh two lives in Pittsburgh you probably don't know where that is certainly do okay two of our children live there uh one i like i said lives near Maryland in in around Maryland DC he works right on the border of DC uh-huh and one lives in Connecticut and our baby lives just a mile over the hill so we'll get to see her a little more than uh what we do the other ones yeah that sounds great i've i've noticed uh another thing um when i was younger my father was always working and uh-huh well they have to yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a full-time job and a part-time job and i never saw him so i didn't have much of a role model to go by yeah uh-huh uh-huh to go to follow uh-huh you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent uh-huh and that kind of thing because i i can't ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad yeah uh-huh and that does make a big difference yeah and it if you don't have i don't i it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow then it's kind of tough you know everybody's not Father Knows Best uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh that's that's well none of us are let's face it you know we're not none of us like they portray portray it on those shows i mean life's much more difficult than that yeah but yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesn't necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them and and uh right right now our daughter our well she's our second oldest she has she's the only that other one that has children she has two boys and she works full time and i have mixed feelings about that she's able to do that and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home but yet on the other hand i i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children i'm kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time yes to those children when they are together and and so it seems it seems for them that it works out all right so i don't know i i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family i yes it's it's not easy i've uh you know i've helped out extremely yeah uh well i can't say that but i've helped out as best i could at home and uh you as you know with five children it takes a lot of work uh-huh uh-huh yes it does it it yeah even if even if someone's home all the time there's still a lot of things that have to be done yeah what line of work are you in now since you went to school and uh well now i work for Texas Instruments so so i'm in computers oh okay okay a lot of the people i've that's called i've talked to work for uh for the same yeah and so i've uh prior to that i uh i worked in a food store uh uh-huh and uh you know work which your income would be a lot better now uh right yeah yeah it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make um i was more intelligent than the position i was holding uh-huh uh-huh right and uh it was and it's kind of a waste of a person yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had you know uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and you you recognized this and was able to you know do something about it yeah i uh yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and that's why i you know if you're working if you're taking twelve credits at night and you're working fifty one hours a week there's not much time left to spend with uh-huh well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family yeah and the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can because it's very easy to uh become go your own direction when you're so when you're working so hard and going to school too yeah yeah well it it all paid off um so uh you know i got my degree and got the better paying job and well that's wonderful uh-huh and uh you know we i think as a family we're a lot better off uh-huh it sounds to me like uh you're doing well my husband's retired so uh he's been retired for three years now yeah that's quite a change uh-huh yeah well my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fifty five oh well he made it at fifty it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know great same job as he was doing only he's retired and doing it independently but uh uh-huh nevertheless retired well i'm  the subject is how we feel about immigration yes would you like to get started or would you like me to well i am very much in favor of closing our door to some extent i'm afraid i've gotten a little bit America first when i get a cab in um-hum almost any large city in the United States and the driver barely speaks English yes uh that's happened to me too yes of course it also happened to us in Sidney Australia this Summer uh or last Summer we got a cab and again it was an oriental person and we asked him to take us to the opera house and he did not know what we were talking about oh my so maybe my isolation isn't for our country might be a little bit for the world i don't know but uh i just feel like we are we have accepted people other people from other countries so well to the point that we have not taken care of our own how do you feel about well i have i'm really torn on the subject i'm not a good candidate for this one i see what you see and i agree with you however well the other side i see because we have Mexico as a neighbor uh-huh and i can tell you right now uh-huh that if i were living in Mexico and trying to raise several children and i could see across the border where the good life would be for my children uh uh-huh would i swim that river every night twice if that's what it took you know i don't care whatever it would take i have real sympathy for those people i really do and you can um you betcha i um however if you were living in Mexico in those conditions would you have several children probably they don't have birth control well they have no concept of it it's against their church but yourself you yourself would not do that you would not have several children if you couldn't well but they don't have if you know if i had to put myself in their shoes i have to do it one hundred percent uh yeah but you don't have their church doesn't teach birth control they preach against it that's not my fault i understand what you're saying but i'm saying i know i feel real sympathy for them so i really and and and by the way i feel the same way when i i just got back from Florida um and boy i tell you happily happily i can i can understand just a little bit of Cuban English uh uh-huh just a little bit which was about all i wanted to understand uh-huh uh but i it's amazing because they're they're bilingual uh-huh uh everything is is Spanish English in Florida and i didn't particularly enjoy it quite frankly uh-huh uh-huh at one point and i cannot say that it's true now but at one point the city of Chicago was required by federal law to hire teachers who spoke Spanish so that they could teach to the the children there who only spoke Spanish yes but this is America and our language is English that's right and i'm sorry that business that's right and i'm sorry that business of making it mandatory i don't like mandatory anything no because it just doesn't work all the time it doesn't fit there are circumstances that are different but i do think if you come to America and you're going to live here and you're going to go to our schools and do all of this speak our language uh um i think so too i really do and it's only fair to the children i think making giving the children an out that they don't have to speak English is just encouraging them to drop out later on because they'll never make it through high school yeah huh-uh well it's English and if they do it won't make any difference because there's not a job for them it's encouraging them to not speak English that's exactly right and that is the wrong message uh-huh i just i don't know i feel so sorry for them but at the same time but that's the same thing you're saying about the little Mexican children that you feel sorry for them and you would swim the river twice but i i would if it were if they were my kids i would so i have to sympathize with the people that come over here and work and send money back sure but uh-huh you know it's it's right on the survival level and we do what we do to survive uh-huh absolutely and and i know what you're saying we do what we have to do for our children regardless regardless of what that is but i'm a little bit unsympathetic with the families right here in our own small town of five thousand who have not limited their family we have three children and that happens to be what we could afford but i don't really feel like i ought to help even if they're people from Indiana support ten children that's not fair i didn't get a say whether they had them or not so i don't think i ought to have to help raise them too critical i i'm concerned about world birth control and oh i'm i'm that's that's one on me too i mean uh-hum there are too many children that are just conceived and produced and dropped on society uh-huh without a thought these crack babies oh isn't that awful i was just reading this thing in the Chicago Tribune yesterday about this little girl who was a crack baby and she was put in a foster home for five years and was having a wonderful life and then her mother are so sad claimed to have her self her act together and she was given back to her birth mother who she had never seen i mean it was just one of those awful things where the Child Protection Service completely broke down and now two years later the court ordered that she be given back to the foster people i it's just awful it's just awful the whole thing doesn't make any sense it's just awful i i as i say i'm isolationist i think we need to to close our doors to some of the immigration and now they're talking about how we're bound to have an influx of immigrants from the latest war from Iraq Iran Saudi Arabia so on and so forth and uh i'm i'm really sorry that i feel the way i do but i just think that we need to not take people as we have over the many last many many years well we had there there's a little background here but it it builds up to what we're talking about our church had a long long discussion group and basically the question started out that as at the time when there were starving people in India i believe uh-huh and the question was should we save these people yeah because and our bottom line answer was no because we cannot save the world because well and we cannot feed the world and we should not please the world this and i think probably they have said that if you save these people by feeding them then they reproduce and then you have a later more serious famine yeah this and the other thing is we can feed them today but they'll be hungry tomorrow what'll we do with them tomorrow do we feed them again tomorrow well how long how long can we continue to feed the world we can't do it are they starving to death yes and that's very sad yeah yeah um-hum um uh-huh sad but we cannot save them we you know okay we can save one uh-huh and that's good but what's you know back to what you're saying if you want to save somebody there's plenty in the United States that need it to when our children were all three at home our oldest daughter uh is still a very giving caring wonderful person she's making a career of uh well she's a director at a care center close to here in fact my mother's a resident there anyhow was uh she got us involved in the Christian Children's Fund and we were sponsoring a young boy in Chattanooga Tennessee in a home then and that went on for oh four or five years and finally we had a letter from the Christian Children's Fund that they were no longer going to uh sponsor children within the continental United States that all of the money would be going to children overseas because for however much money we were sending a month they could buy so much more milk and bread and rice and so on and so forth for children overseas well at so they're taking the world viewpoint yeah well at that point we said no we're not doing this any more we wanted to help somebody here within the continental United States it wasn't our choice to to send and then too i think that money gets watered down in administrative costs when it all goes overseas and i always wonder if people who need it actually get it um-hum but by profession i negotiate for Texas Instruments a lot and i'm somewhat cynical um about humans and their behavior um uh-huh because i have had many interesting examples of human behavior uh-huh when you're talking about money you'd be surprised how human we all get very quickly it all turns different doesn't it uh-huh um we were on a cruise ship one time and some people from the Methodist Church were talking about how their church diocese had poured thousands of dollars into Haiti and it had been used for Papa Doc's daughter's wedding uh-huh there you go which i'm sure that's not what they had in mind when they were pouring that money in the but see that's what happens And the other sad thing i heard about the Kurds  some of the TV shows that uh i i like are usually something that shows me something about a profession that i don't necessarily know how it operates and one of the earliest shows that uh taught me something was the old Bewitched shows when i was growing up i remember thinking so that's how the advertising game is played that's how they developed these things that's where commercials come from and i really didn't uh before that i think that was the very first show that i ever realized that on and then right oh a little bit later i don't particularly like LA Law as a series but i do like some of the insights not so much into the legal profession but into the the fact that some of the well for instance some of the deals that are made by the DA you know you read about some of these things and it sounds really bad well you don't know what's gone on before right um they had one case where uh the DA had been injured she had been hurt and you know was a little bit fearful of of making friends uh any enemies at the moment right so uh just little things like that makes well there's a human behind this little story you know that that was was written up in the paper that DA cuts a bad deal yeah as well as some of the the arguments on you know a guy gets arrested for DWI well depending upon what the guy says he's going to say in court regardless of the truth what the guy says he's going to say is you know is fifteen minutes later before they gave me the test and all these kinds of things and you could probably get away you know get off on it so they just plea bargained it out and is just done with it sure oh i i those little things i guess i have to be reminded that there're there're so many details that just don't get out that you can't uh can't take the reported word for some of these things so i guess i like shows that that show me something some insights into other parts of of living that i don't always get exposed to how about yourself right i i don't know i've i like tend to like a lot of the old uh older TV shows like uh for instance there there's i love watching old Twilight Zones and uh they've they've been there's a station station here that runs mostly syndicated things and that's one thing i like to catch on late at night is the old Twilight Zones but uh for TV that's out right now i i the shows i like to see for one reason or another that i've been catching um Matlock and Tuesday nights for some some are i guess are my TV night and i like to see uh Matlock and then In the Heat of the Night uh uh-hum are two shows that that i like to see after seeing the the television show In the Heat of the Night i wanted i haven't never seen the movie but uh i think i'd like to check out that movie sometime it's uh right i don't know it's just kind of interesting they have great characters in that uh TV show and it's interesting from i just saw the pilot to it oh a week or two ago and it was a special two hour thing but it was the first like like i said a pilot and uh right the characters in it were the white police officers when the black the black guy from Philadelphia went down there were much more bigoted and more the villains in that episode and now over the time in the television show they're all very much uh uh not not bigoted or very more more you know more in the twentieth century now let's say or or very unbigoted and they even have added uh this uh other right right black police officer to the cast so it's interesting how they kind of got away from the original i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh he had with the police officers and now it's more concentrated on the problems they have in the small town in the south and it it's kind of interesting because it's supposed to be this little tiny town in down in hum uh down south but uh i live in this little teeny town up here in upstate New York and it's not too much different so people got a lot to learn everywhere huh that's interesting yeah yeah i i've seen Heat of the Night through off and on through out it's uh television career as it were and i i wonder if uh if they did that intentionally or if they just had uh right whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um right i i don't know either i don't quite possible that they wanted it to become more of the subtle problems that it is today as opposed to the the hitting over the head type problems that it was then right right and uh they they have uh uh pretty good bunch of actors and well acted parts i mean you can take a good actor and put him in a bad part and it doesn't do any good but uh they they found a good combination of roles and and actors and actresses on that show and it's a pretty good one sure it's a lot different seeing Carroll O'Connor in that role than uh Archie Bunker it's like yeah that's true that's true and maybe a little more versatile than anybody ever gave him credit for didn't get the right but uh uh yeah there're there're just starting to rerun those uh All in the Family down here on a particular on a major station and it's uh i never did like it particularly and i've watched a couple of them off and on uh just to get a feel for what what was being said then but it uh the i i don't know it's it's it's a pretty simplistic deal and i mean they they pound whatever message they're going to say over and over and that's about the end of it so right i don't know if i would have liked it when it was current and and being discussed maybe it would have been a little better but uh course the this is The Heat of the Night isn't it no the uh the All in the Family reruns that are showing showing now oh oh the All in the Ha Family right right right they they really take whatever point they're wanting to make they they reiterate it over and over you know it's as if the the intelligence level of the people that watch this or something other they handle over a wide you know range of right of uh topics but uh the uh i don't know maybe it would have been better the first time through when it was more sure uh when the public was talking about it you know sit around the table and talk about the this that and the other but some of the issues seemed a little out dated but of course that's what reruns are for and right when is relevant or yeah well you've got old Meathead there and the rest of the gang at the where Meathead and and Sally Sally Struthers there with the um the the liberals the the supposedly correct view at the time and then uh the Archie Bunker with his uh antiquated uh the rednecked uh right ideas i don't know it the old meets new head on and whatever but now it's all old so right you could have another one you could have a new TV show with uh Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers in with their kids moving in and uh right going another generation's problems yeah and have them be uh oh i don't even know yuppies are passe now i'm not even sure what uh what to latch on to yeah i don't know well i hear one of my kiddos coming in the door so i'll wind this one up and go see what they need okay well it was nice talking to you maybe we'll cross paths again later all right bye-bye um bye  so how do you keep up with the news most of it is TV um do you read the newspaper yes i do we get a daily and then i get uh the Wall Street Journal also um what daily it's the uh Charlotte Observer Charlotte Observer um is that there in your city yes right uh-huh so uh the Wall Street Journal gives financial news and other information i'm interested in so uh do you think you get anything from your local newspaper yes but it's usually after the fact uh as far as the major topics because most of the other has been on TV don't you agree um yeah i don't i'm not exactly sure how good the national news is though how accurate exactly yeah oh i think uh during the Middle East Crisis there was a problem in terms of too quick to try to get a scoop and not checking facts out and i think that's probably a a good relevant uh uh fear of all of it yeah i didn't see a movie a long time ago but it was about the news team that um fear tried to influence the world and i i have a feeling that they're much more into themselves sometimes than they are into what the world um is ready to hear they create news yeah it seems like they're not really trying to report the news they are trying to report how the news affects them yeah yeah i think so too or where they're at with the news or something along those lines uh radio is sort of a catch up in fact i was um listening to the radio the other day and that they were reporting on the condition of an of an accident victim and i had already seen on the news about an hour before that that accident victim had died but the radio news report was that he was still in intensive care so it's one of those um it the most immediate is TV The others are catch up and fill in yeah a little bit of color or something for the lack of total information that was given on the TV lack they give immediate for the lack of total uh-huh how do you feel the newspapers there in Colorado Springs treats local interest news well rather biasedly i think i believe huh very pro city uh-huh uh for the city fathers but uh it seems almost as though they don't care about how the national news affects the local area uh-huh uh i think about other topics too i i'd like to go to a city and sort of look at the front page and find out what is going on in that city but it's always the national information that you have to flip through to find out anything special about the city and i think that's uh yeah and then they give give you just the local O bits and that's it uh-huh uh-huh and and well hell you don't know know those people that died or or what from no the older you get the more you know though well what i mean is do you if your in a strange city you certainly don't know them oh right right yeah that's true what type of work are you in i work for Texas Instruments okay uh that uh is a news worthy company in itself so you're you would be interested in any news related to it yeah uh yes and yourself oh i'm i'm consulting right now i'm in between jobs so it makes uh it makes a difference i'm i'm interested in many more industries than i used to be just in terms of looking around so it yeah i understand i've been in the oil and gas business and then higher education and um done a few other things including international uh accounting so huh that's interesting i've always considered myself uh how is this best put the the Charles Bollfield trash oh okay uh uh grew up in West Texas thank you yeah yeah i understand that i was in Oklahoma so i i know the area very well yeah yeah yeah uh um so do you think our local do you think our national news tells us anything important oh yes they'll they'll tell you a lot that's important but the trouble is the value do you watch Sixty Minutes and some of those other um yeah i i i watch Sixty Minutes i i wonder sometimes where they get those topics you know some of the topics are very very good and others are like uh who who who dreamed this subject up you know almost religiously well and and far as affecting a national audience i wonder sometimes and more importantly than that i wonder how the other side of the story is uh-huh yeah and of course they're not going to tell the other side of the story and they're not going to tell it accurately no but i do enjoy we are here temporarily i enjoyed having CNN so that i could tune in the news any time i wanted to and not wait for network broadcasting uh we don't we don't have cable okay it's it's a good addition because i think they're they have a lot of news obviously all the time and there's not the pressure then yeah we've watched little bits here and there during the Gulf Crisis and we uh-huh yeah the i didn't exactly i wasn't exactly sure how accurate it was either oh i think it it too is under pressure and it seemed as though during the Gulf Crisis it might have been under pressure from the incorrect side uh-huh oh yes it was there are games played i i'm not sure how to phrase that uh delicately psychological warfare is a big factor all the way around um it's been it's been a big factor for many many years but this is the first uh first time we have seen it so quickly and so close up yeah it is it i i didn't feel comfy you know i you know you always hear about the warm fuzzy feeling uh-huh i kept watching that be it CNN in a bar or or or or local news at home or federal news at home or or see uh uh-huh we don't subscribe to our Colorado Springs paper we subscribe to the Denver paper Denver paper okay and uh but on occasion more than occasionally we'll buy the local paper uh-huh uh-huh and that warm fuzzy that we're talking about i never could get that warm fuzzy feeling in the pit of my stomach about are these people really telling me the truth or more importantly all the truth yeah i think all the truth is is the big issue they obviously had to be telling a lot of truth because they were there reporting firsthand but in terms of well i'd suspect that to be true but you couldn't prove it to me yeah yeah and and most importantly i couldn't believe any of those people they didn't seem believable did you just switch back and forth between programs oh all four um well we have the independent here and we've got the three majors and PBS and we watched all four of those and on more than occasionally i went to a bar that had CNN running around the clock uh-huh and still i got this feeling as though from these six or eight news sources i had that something was missing uh i think they they withhold when it's advantageous both sides both sides and i think when Norman announced afterwards on the Barbara Walters Show and oh Storming Norman yes that um he knew you know what to expect out of Saddam Saddam Hussein that he was playing games you know and and they both were i think that's all part of warfare is to play games oh of course and you've got to expect that yeah but i had the feeling that no matter who i listened to it wasn't that they weren't telling me the truth i felt that someone was lying to me and there's nothing there still at this state that i can put my finger on and say oh here's where they lied to me yeah just a feeling yeah well let's hope we don't have to go through that again yes wouldn't it be wonderful if there were no more wars oh that would be nice i hope we never never get to but i'm afraid um human nature is such that somewhere there'll be a fanatic that will start something and more importantly wouldn't it be nice in this land of the free and home of the brave if there were never again be any misinformation oh yes oh yes  okay so do you do a lot of cooking in your family um i do some every now and then i i work and my wife's home during the day so she usually ends up doing most of it um-hum oh yeah when i was single we used to always cook around the house yeah do do you like to cook huh yeah i really like it um there's a few dishes like i i grew up with the um you know having Polish and Ukrainian food yeah yeah oh really and my wife she likes Italian and stuff so we we definitely have different tastes so oh yeah yeah but that's neat though because you get to have different stuff yeah i'm not i'm a pretty bad cook i'm pretty bad my husband is really good he put himself through college working in restaurants uh-huh oh wow and uh he's a much better cook than i am so when i was home i still cooked a lot and i was into a lot of vegetarian stuff and now that i went back to work about a year and a half ago so one of the things that he took over was the cooking and the kids are thrilled they're really happy that i don't cook anymore they're like uh preferring it now right yeah they say oh dad let dad cook mom let him do it but um so so do you all do you have kids you obviously have one okay you have two yeah two um-hum yeah one is uh nine months and the other is two and a half two and half oh yeah that's the hard part is cooking with uh kids around because uh i was just going to say makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it or are you not at that stage yet yeah it does yeah we try our hardest to to get them to eat what we eat you know right and my sister uh she's the master of the fast order grill you know she can make uh she makes six different meals but we like to have one thing you know one likes chicken nuggets the other one like hot dogs oh yeah oh my gosh oh my gosh i couldn't yeah and then she makes noodles with uh with soy uh soy sauce or whatever so all things but um yeah our favorite let me think i was thinking of the one recipe that uh boy i couldn't do that i that we made i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy and that was um what's that uh scallops uh scallop um oh really it has a French name it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese cream sauce with it oh yeah what's what is that Saint Jack or something scallops saint something or yeah yeah yeah and you pour it over rice yeah uh yeah i can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore but uh it it basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then uh standard cream sauce base and then uh really with scallops the scallops and it sounds sort of funny but it tastes really good no no i'm from New England so we we had um a lot of seafood before we moved down here uh-huh and uh that sounds delicious to me that sounds great i think we're just thinking of having a uh dinner party we went to this dinner party the other night that yeah yeah but uh was kind of like a game they had uh a murder mystery and you came dressed as one of the characters and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner um-hum um-hum and it was really fun and so we we were thinking we wanted to do you know we were going to try doing it ourselves but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table and that kind of interrupted the game so right right yeah so i was thinking there's this beef bourguignonne recipe that i've tried before that's pretty good and then you can make that ahead and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready um-hum so that's uh yeah that's another thing i have a problem with my wife yeah she uh she likes to um she doesn't like the beef dishes she likes the chicken and fish uh yeah and like i said we always ate beef and uh pork oh yeah you know a lot so i know my husband did too his parents are Austrian and they uh always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table oh yeah red meat plenty of good red meat yeah yeah yeah my dad could eat a a meal with out any vegetables at all oh my gosh and uh Susan's you know they had you know meatless meals you know my dad wouldn't know what to do yeah yeah oh gosh so do you course she grew up Catholic so you know they they sort of come with the there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have oh they did the that you do right right that's just part of it uh-huh yeah we didn't my family didn't but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly he never there was dishes that he really enjoyed um-hum um-hum eating there there were several things that he liked but it never was really something that he would have chosen it's just that i cooked so he had to put up with it right so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but yeah it's hard to get a protein content up then yeah yeah that's true huh yeah i like i like them every now and then for a change yes it's nice yeah some of the stuff is good but it just it was a tremendous amount of cooking because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete um-hum um-hum and we had little kids at the time you know when i was home with them and it it was just so much cooking i couldn't i don't like to cook and i'm not really that great at it so it just turned out to be too much of a too much too much cooking um-hum so well i guess i'll let you get back to feeding your little one there yeah no uh he's all done yeah yeah i set him down he's set oh okay okay do you like to bake at all or do you do you get into that's that's yeah we used to do that um my mom used to go crazy every Sunday until my dad like blew up you know after after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy she stopped doing it yeah but um she used to have you know two dozen sticky buns three bread rolls you know every week really no kidding and um the sticky buns of course would last you know three or four days and that would be it yeah then be gone i know that's the thing about baking i used to i i don't mind baking at all and i i can do a pretty good pie we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother and my mother taught me how to make it um-hum um-hum and um so i can make a pretty mean pie but um i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening we had the same kind of problem if you make homemade bread i mean forget it's supposed to save you money but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat it tastes so good hum um-hum uh-huh we always we had that bread that was uh um you ever seen the the starter bread i can't remember what it's called they call it the um Amish bread here but uh it's made with you just leave leave it out oh uh yeah yeah i you know and you let it spoil sort of yeah you know yeah uh-huh i've heard of that i've heard of it but i've never done it yeah that sounds pretty good yeah it tasted pretty good really yeah oh yeah but um it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad and then you add all these other ingredients to it but yeah and then you save you make the bread but you pinch off a portion or save a portion of it for the next time or something yeah right yeah you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else and that's how they continue the thing yeah yeah yeah i know it sounds it always sounded i don't know how safe that was sounded pretty bad yeah i know it sounded strange to me too i figure well you're baking it so you know yeah yeah yeah that's true that's that's got to got to kill anything i guess but um-hum okay well i'll talk to you later where are you calling from by the way Texas all right well yeah thanks Plano yeah Plano in Texas are you in Texas where Plano okay no Falls Church Virginia no kidding gosh it sounds so close yeah i know we've got a good connection must be a uh TI connection yeah yeah i thought for sure yeah i thought for sure you were in Dallas or something yeah i i talked to so many people from Texas that's where practically everybody i talked to is from i think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state you know yeah yeah yes yeah they're do they're trying to get all different amount of people well jeez my husband is from Richmond and i went to UVA that's where we met yeah yeah oh oh really yeah i went to school at uh well i went to school at West Virginia University but oh you did yeah but i grew up right here in Falls Church right outside DC yeah yeah boy we'd like to get back over to the East Coast i'll tell you it's nice over there yeah it's sort of funny i have people that want to go to Dallas oh really yeah one of my one of my friends here he was just talking how he's thinking on leaving the company and going to Dallas saying how oh yeah no kidding well its things are doing pretty good down here we we were we tried to move over to Raleigh last year and there just was there was so little such little going on in Raleigh you know you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there so we decided we'll try in a couple of years but but business is yeah yeah we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash you know yeah you probably could well Northern Virginia you probably could okay well it's good talking to you okay nice talking to you too bye bye take care bye  okay what do you think about it well uh the roles have definitely changed in the last generation or so um oh yeah i i think a lot of it has to do with women working uh-huh yeah i do too i think it's going to in like in the future i think all women are going to work i mean they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby yeah yeah but that will be it or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you can just you know just continue right on with your work i mean it it really is coming to that because most women yeah yeah now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them they can't even afford to take off you know to have children it seems like right right and it and it seems if you're going to have kids uh that you are you know society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it yeah and uh because if you have you know two well if you go to work you're just working to pay for day care two or three you know um right now i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where when my kids were you know when i had them and when they were small uh-huh until they got in junior high school my youngest one got in junior high i didn't have to work i mean i didn't work i i needed to but i didn't oh that is good yeah Steve's Steve has a sister who has four she just had her fourth one in uh March and she doesn't have to work either i don't know how they do it i don't i don't know how people do it with one you know um obviously let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you would you know yeah obviously we don't have any and and i don't i think that's part of the role reversal is it's okay to get married and not have kids and i think for society for such a long time said well you know you're married now you need to set have have your family and i don't think it's been until recently that that they had decided that two people was a family oh yeah right right well it's getting where you can't hardly afford if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two you know and right and i mean it's hard with two now we uh my youngest one i have two i have a son and a daughter and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon but if i had a third one oh yeah i just don't know where it would come from yeah because i work now i work full time and uh you know it when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got yeah they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that that helps out but still it cost a lot oh yeah i mean just the you know the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and right stuff and cars and all their books and the books are outrageous oh i know i know i mean absolutely outrageous and they're getting worse uh my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for her one of her next classes and it was like ninety six dollars and this book is a little bitty skinny book i said my goodness what is it lined in gold you know uh but it is it's getting worse and jeez yeah yeah if i'd of probably had three or four children i don't see how we could have made it you know without me working but that's that's probably because you know if you had three you you know would say if i'd of had four i guess it's always not not being able to picture one more but in essence you probably would have worked out fine right but i think i would have had to work if i'd of had that many i'd of had to work in order for my kids to you know even though he brings in a real good living and everything in order for me to keep up i would have had to work yeah yeah but i think it's getting more and more like when you have one child now that's it you know then you go to work and you work because yeah if you have two or three kids by the way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work and it's just going to be an accepted thing there isn't going to be any of this you know very few people will ever stay home yeah and and that's all right with me because i don't want to stay home you know i think i'm just part of that the new stuff that is just yeah i don't know i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long well you know i can't imagine how i did because now i work all the time and um well i work all week and um i can't imagine how i stayed home you know i think to myself what did i do yeah yeah and i think it just it revolutionized an where a woman thinks that a way you know just like now my daughter there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now to her everything is you've got to go through college you've got to get a job you know and then when everything's set up then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with but i mean it is so far down the road where now when i graduated high school the thing uh-huh and then you got married and then you had a family right that's you did that's what you did uh i mean that's just the way it was you know and uh that's like when my mom i know when my mother's age it was yeah always the kids and the family and everything had to come first and the woman stayed home and took care of them an yeah yeah i uh i i like the way it is it's uh being see we're from Houston and so it's not so hard yeah for people you know you've been married three or so years and you don't have kids well it's okay not nobody does but you come to a place like Belton and there a lot of the kids here get married out of high school it's real small town uh-huh and it's and a lot of people in our Sunday we're the only couple in our Sunday School class except for one other couple who are in their forties and they can't have children who don't have children and they can't imagine why we would want to have children and i'm going well you know there's more to life you know there's life in there that's you know not everybody has to have kids and i'd rather spend the time with my husband than you know spending time here it's your turn you know right yeah but you know that now even whenever i was coming up and everything and we got married right out of high school well a year after i got out of high school and uh i didn't have kids for four and a half years uh-huh but that was because i wanted to work and i wasn't ready for kids and everybody thought oh my gosh what is the matter with her you know yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either they're probably going oh i bet she can't get pregnant right i mean they thought that it was terrible you know and then when i'd tell them you know well i'm just not ready for children yet oh but that you know you better you better just get ready now well you don't just get ready yeah but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time they had kids within a year and i just was not ready for kids i wanted to get out and work a little bit and yeah i wanted to travel and stuff like that which we did and uh kids didn't fit in right then but it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples and really if you don't w ant the kids then it's not the time to have it i don't care what anybody tells you and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that a way uh-huh right because that's like my daughter now she says that you know maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then yeah and uh even though i'd like to hav e grandchildren i can see her point yeah Steve's mom finally uh finally said you know said that that God will take care of us when it's our time right she finally admitted you know she finally told me it's okay if you don't but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very very old fashioned family uh-huh and she stayed home and raised her kids and and she expected all of her kids to do that too and their wives and to be the the housewife and have dinner ready by five and and you know be there at every beck and call and i was raised totally opposite how we got together i don't know but because my mother had six girls um and you know she worked too and i guess i just yeah and i saw how life was when she stayed home and it was rough it was hard you know yeah and it really is i know it just like now you know there's there's so much more now all my income goes for things like luxuries i mean it really does except for what we give to my daughter to you know put her through college and stuff but the rest of it we just buy things like uh-huh boats or we go on trips or you know just right the more or less like entertainment stuff but yeah i think you've you've earned that though yeah i feel like i have you know because well we're to the age now i'm not old but i'm older uh-huh and uh i got to stay home with my kids which i really wanted to do but now i could not go back and do it i really couldn't i don't think i could stay home all the time and do nothing and i mean i did stuff but yeah right to me it feels like i must have done nothing and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking yeah i think so i think it would be neat if if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both but uh a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you well you know more and more of them are i don't know if it is up there where you are but where i am the just like all the hospitals they're getting day care but the reason they had to do this was because so many people uh-huh are they you know so many women could not afford like you said if you had four kids or even if you had two kids you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go so uh more and more of our hospitals especially over here are getting them and then some of the bigger companies but it's mainly the hospitals right yeah i don't know if the TI in Dallas does or not i know i know nobody around here does it we're it's too small around here yeah i don't oh really um  okay what i was doing at at home in fact i work at nights here so that's another long story we'll talk about it's funny that i got you though yeah it is uh i asked my wife to hand me the other phone because i was just i was busy and uh i had just gotten a call and i couldn't answer it and i said well i'll punch it on this one uh-huh and uh it's a walk around phone but it's not a uh it's not the other kind you know yeah that's what mine is uh-huh so it didn't work now i've got a portable cordless is that what you're using okay no i'm using a regular phone now uh okay i got a i i'm using a cordless if if it's a what kind of phone do they talk it's not a dial but if it's a touchtone it's okay yeah right i realized that once i used i should have i was going to go in the kitchen and and punch one on the touchtone uh-huh and i realized that i had screwed it up so it was my fault okay that's funny that we had gotten it yeah it is uh i guess they want us to talk about dogs but dogs or cats dogs and cats that your cat your Rex i'll switch over to birds you know we we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats uh-huh we always wind up with i haven't yet uh a bird or two in the Summer because the cat will catch one and usually we'll catch the cat because the cat doesn't seem to kill the bird right away oh really uh-huh we wound up with a lot of birds over the years and oh there are organizations we drop ours off at Fort Worth if they're still alive and you keep it alive which is hard to do for a couple of weeks uh-huh if you take it to an agency they'll send it back in the wild somehow and so we we wound up because of our cats with with many birds over the years uh again they're not pets exactly but uh oh oh this guy at work that i work with uh raises birds uh he has a a macaw macaw macaw yeah and parakeets and something else he one of those macaw parrots the lady next door across from across the street from us just lost is it a cockatoo what's that one that's white yeah a cockatoo i think it's a cockatoo it got loose and i've forgotten what how she did it and she had it in a cage of some sort did it really and what they were doing i don't know but it flew away you know and they called it and everything and rode drove around the neighborhood looking for it but uh um-hum those are expensive yeah it's free yeah i'm surprised that a bird uh i guess they can find their way back but i wonder exactly where a tame bird would go did she ever get it back no no she never got it back i've heard stories like this before with parrots and all this uh because people let them out out in their house you know and fly around oh that's uh-huh yeah my daughter had one i wouldn't have one flying around my house and no i know uh but uh i've forgotten she had it outside somehow and somehow they they mixed signals or something and uh it got loose of course again again the animals are so much faster than we are in one way or the other yeah boy that's a shame uh you know i was telling you the story about fencing i do like dogs i i would i've always had dogs my whole life as a kid uh-huh um-hum uh don't you miss them now i mean well yeah i do i because they're they have such personalities yeah i do i think that all the animals have personality i'm not the cat person i my sister had cats when we were little um-hum we always seem to have a cat and a dog together which again when you bring them up i do notice that yeah they get along right and my wife was the cat lover and when when we started out as a young young married couple we just had an apartment so you it's kind of easier to have a cat yeah right right and then she just never wanted a dog and then we got here to Texas uh she's from Texas again and uh she she had this thing with the fence and i i guess i have so many interests i don't really quite have the time with with two daughters and everything uh-huh yeah right and all the activities to personally train a dog but i would i would i guess i'll have to wait until both of my kids are out of college before i get another dog again i guess i'm yeah right right i i i certainly saw your point with the Greyhound that there's there is a limit yeah uh to a pet um yeah you know you think you're you think that's what you want and i really gave it a good try um-hum and i had her spoiled i mean she was spoiled rotten but she was so and i have a new house and i and to walk in my house i'd have especially uh especially on a rainy day i'd have to take a bucket of water out there and wash all four of her feet this is a fifty pound dog i'm going to pick up a leg at a time and wash and set it down on something clean while i got the other three you know and and then i'd let her in the house well still even putting her feet in the bucket of water and wash them real good she still would come in so fast and so heavy that she'd dig her paws deep down into my carpet you know and just take out running to and she would yeah oh she was ruining my carpet and i thought gosh i i love my new house more than i love her i think you know i just really have a big investment and i don't i just it was just more work than it was really really i wasn't enjoying her that's what it was maybe if i'd a had a run for a dog run but i think that's cruel to put a dog in a run yeah yeah no i think so too uh my wife just she keeps convincing me because my my parents uh my parents are dead now but my parents and my brothers and sisters always had dogs uh-huh and when we would visit them she said you can smell dog over the house i said well you're really right yeah and so i never she always had a good argument why not to get a dog and we haven't since we've been married yeah but now see i have always felt that i could always smell cats cats to me always i i i used to have some friends' house that i couldn't stand to go in their house i could smell their their litter box i thought oh my God i couldn't stand it and i don't know how they stood it i guess they didn't smell it yeah oh yeah yeah uh no yeah i think you're right uh people are surprisingly are allergic to cats too we do have some friends on and off that will oh do you i guess it's the hair the cat the short fur on the cat is uh one of the allergic reaction things like uh uh-huh cedar trees and all of the other stuff i guess the cat has a real fine not the that the real short hair dandruff or whatever they have that people do get allergic to cats uh yeah uh-huh yeah in their eyes you know they just walk in the house even though we lock up the cats and they're crying yeah that's right and so some people unfortunately of course i wouldn't have an animal if i was allergic to it either well i wouldn't either uh my wife at one time said she was allergic to them uh uh-huh i was going to say a story well i know is there're supposed to be is it Chihuahuas they're supposed to be good for asthma they say Chihuahua dogs are supposed to be good for people with asthma i always heard well i think the animal's good for you just because uh it gets you out and everything i uh oh yeah and don't i think they're using you know they're using animals in old folks home now and make and some hospitals because it's supposed to make people oh yeah brings your blood pressure down you know dogs are always so happy to see you come home you know they always are just wagging i don't care how grumpy you are or what dogs are glad to see you oh yeah cats are kind of independent like get in they're they let you live with them you know so independent right i have some friends uh uh that have horses you know uh-huh and when my daughters were a little younger you know i thought well maybe that's a good maybe i'll get them uh you know this is Texas and i'll get them a horse uh-huh well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money the horse was sick all the time oh you i don't know if you if you have any friends with horses but they get all kinds of eating disorders if they don't if they don't eat the right grain or if you oh see i was thinking about buying a horse maybe i don't want if you give him an orange or something you nearly kill it i mean it the the stories he would tell it must have cost him a couple hundred dollars a month uh-huh just to feed of course he had several horses for shots and different things i thought my God and i just saw something interesting Consumer Reports they talked they had a animals and they compared oh uh-huh you know whether you should have a bird and and the pricing and it had a comment around a horse something to the effect of you don't even want to know what it cost to keep a horse you know and i cost yeah i think i'll just go rent a horse if i want to ride one right i think the best thing in the world is to rent them i think that uh yeah i do too that that and boats are probably the same way i'd love to have a boat too but i think uh i'm not too sure i i would get that much use out of it you know yeah no i mean well i do enjoy my dog uh she's such a oh she's my best friend and when when i lived in Orlando she uh got paralyzed from her waist down and uh waist my goodness from what and i thought it was uh uh we almost had to put her to sleep and i just cried for two days but i think what i i i ironically what happened was she got had fleas and i think it was the stuff i was having putting on her that that paralyzed her but my goodness the fleas i think's what brought her back is she had to scratch so bad that she started using her paralyzed the the doctor was just amazed at a that she came back because yeah he really was going to was going to do surgery for fifteen hundred dollars or put her to sleep and i was going to have to opt to have to put her to sleep even as much much as i loved her i wasn't going to spend fifteen hundred dollars on an experiment oh yeah yeah plus i'm not too sure yeah i think they are experiments too and they don't know that much uh no but it was just uh that spot that they put on the back of a dog uh they used to use it on cattle and uh so i started using it on her and i'd take to her to the vet once a month and get that spot put on her my sister spent a lot of go ahead and she wouldn't have any fleas never had any fleas hadn't never any then all of a sudden uh i took her huh i was living in Orlando and i put i put her in the vet for while i came home to Dallas for a while and i took and when i picked her up she had fleas again and so my daughter came down and visited me me from Dallas and and while she was there the dog got paralyzed hm and so i took her back up to the doctor and anyway he he said it wasn't that but another doctor told me that there had been uh people the pet owners had been getting permanently paralyzed from petting the dogs that had that spot on them my goodness so i thought well and so i can't find a vet that'll do that for me anymore put the spot on her anymore and i don't want it anymore anyway yeah but i do fight fleas oh gosh oh yeah they're they're a problem the the different rainy seasons here i don't how long you been here in in the area yeah oh i moved back in eighty eight the December of eighty eight oh course you were here before yeah i lived here before i'd worked for TI for seventeen years and then i moved to Orlando uh with Mark and Marietta yeah okay and let let me talk about fleas we have nothing compared to fleas down they have down there oh really and they have them year round at least they die out kind of in the wintertime here in the yard down there they don't they're are just and they are big suckers i mean big yeah oh really and they are just almost impossible to get rid of it costs a fortune if you have a pet you're going to have fleas down there oh oh yeah and i just had my house treated and treated and treated and treated and did i did all the things you're supposed to and i couldn't get rid of  okay he did where'd he decide to go um to Williams College in Massachusetts uh-huh sure i'm familiar with it and that he was he was uh trying to decide between University of Pennsylvania and Williams and it was a very difficult choice and uh and he well he must know is he interested in law or medicine he must have a definite profession in mind no but that's one of the reasons why he chose Williams that it has solid liberal arts oh okay medium size aren't they about two thousand is he excited very excited yes uh i have another son who's at their chief rival Amherst College wow i can i uh-huh while they're east coast i mean i don't know anything about their football but there you go well they're they're they're really very strong academic rather than you know big sports yeah that's where where you at we're outside of uh Washington in Maryland how about you oh okay i'm in uh suburban Dallas uh-huh do you have children in no i don't i have a husband we don't have any kids yet about all i can say is i guess about picking schools um i guess uh if you don't know what you're going to do liberal arts program is a good idea okay um well i i one of the the advises we've given our children is that you can always learn a job this is true uh but what you can't learn uh on a job is a good solid well rounded well rounded education right the humanities the history yeah that's right you know the Renaissance man and uh and if you get that you can and if you do well you can you can learn a job right right no no no yeah but they you know if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school usually a company it will if it's worth it's weight will subsidize and that's exactly right that's right so the advice we gave to them was number one visit the colleges that you're thinking about describe first of all uh-huh this this is true yeah the size school that you might be interested in and if you want to go away right do you want to go away how far from home do you want to be right what do you want in a college now my son is a national level competitive swimmer good so he wanted to swim in school but he did not want to be in a swim factory okay so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at they'd in Austin Texas University of Texas that's right that's the University of Texas at Austin or Stanford or something like that so he didn't even consider those right Texas Aquatics yeah okay well that's i think the other thing is too um i know i went to a uh city high school in Chicago and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say my brother and i were and economics was the choice um uh-huh uh-huh sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school he is very very strong academically yeah so we've just but you know he had to look to see what kind of environment he liked and yet he he did wind up having to make a choice he did apply to a large you know large group uh-huh yeah University of Penn i'm originally from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania University of Pennsylvania it's got about nine thousand undergraduate yeah that's strong i mean that's you know and it's it's well it's a little bit i don't want to use the word wilder that's not the word i want um more diverse yeah yeah yeah uh yes and it but it does have the under you know that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school so that the uh the college of arts and sciences is you know i guess about four thousand at Williams or Pennsylvania at Williams at Pennsylvania well how large is Williams at Pennsylvania Williams is an undergraduate school only um and it's a total of two thousand right well that's not bad yeah so he knew the feeling because my other son is at Amherst which is fifteen hundred and he had visited his brother at Amherst and knew that he liked the environment but he did go on college visits and he liked which is a lot uh-huh that's the thing to do i mean i not having any children my husband was an Ohio State person and uh that has something like either the first or second largest um-hum student population like fifty thousand combined community yes yes it's large and they both boys had decided no that they did not want that yeah that is too much and i mean i um i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at Bennington in Vermont um and that was this was twenty years ago showing my age oh it's so you uh-huh and did you ever eat at the Blue Bin Diner yes oh my God where are you from well let's not talk about that okay no but we've been there when i'm up at Williams we've gone up there it's um in that area i mean i just can't say enough about it oh it's it whatever we went and he was you know impressed by the clean air and he he met the students at both schools and he liked them well you know um my husband's an engineer and a strong liberal a strong liberal arts background with uh a graduate degree in a technical field will get him much further than say like a a strong um business administration degree than with another MBA on top of it uh-huh that's okay that's it the thing is if if a person really knows very early on that they want to go in a technical field than you're not then it's probably good to go to you know to apply to a school with a strong technical program uh-huh and they usually yeah but they usually don't but uh for if you're going into if you know engineering is the thing if then you've got to at least take engineering right but they no but who does i mean i think i think all i think the majority of people just don't know no he looked at criteria such as location size of school yeah that's right uh-huh no he didn't apply to any school further the furthest away was Bowdoin in Maine which is about twelve hours that's still pretty far though i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go yeah that was the furthest and then Kenyon in Ohio which was about six and a half hours and Williams is about seven oh that's not too bad yeah so well i mean he so it wasn't he you know then the University of Pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train and then Bucknell in mid state Pennsylvania yeah he will enjoy Williams i think and is a good academic yeah and he knew and if it came down i mean as he came he's been talking to them and and he came down and one of the things that he said is he went to Pennsylvania this weekend and he had an absolutely marvelous time he had a great time uh-huh but then he said you know it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun that could very well be i mean and he said it almost backfired i think it backfired so he's developing his his uh internal instincts right now that's good because i mean i'm sure what he said was true that uh you well actually that's one of the reasons i went to uh Kenyon he went he made a good choice i went i so i well swear w e're not supposed to but i spent a year in Vermont my freshman year it was just too far away it was too different uh the level of income of lot of the students and their attitudes was just um beyond my um-hum yeah well um in terms of drugs et cetera which i thought was shocking of course that period too was probably difficult to for you but i did uh my advice to him and my husband's was that right yeah you're right but then i went yeah he had to really decide what he wanted out of college he had to look at himself uh in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it he could probably slip and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school where especially in a Kenyon or a Williams where you see the professors around town all the time you skip class in the morning and they see you uh-huh and you're going to get a little bit more input than discipline yeah that's yeah yeah and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you uh so that and he will know the professors in a small well i don't know how to put this either in this way and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today i think the refinement that they get i don't mean specifically etiquette or culture but just what you're saying just a solid background uh-huh yeah yeah because i just don't think at that age i just don't think that young people know what they want to do that's right that's right and um and it's just the personal contact where if you need help you know and um that's right he has i told him to look to yourself are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred that you're really going to look him up but if it's a class of fifteen right right lecture yeah this is very very and you need help you know that it's much easier to do it and especially in the large schools they have lectures oh and even though they may break it up into smaller groups uh Penn is known for having they have video lectures yeah video lectures graduate assistants teaching they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups this is true and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the did he just make the decision today just a he made the decision uh i'd say about uh an hour and a half ago how funny yeah i mean that's so funny i mean and and in fact he had just an hour before that two uh recent graduates from Kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him well he'll that's funny and uh i mean and he they were really nice and but he said is that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better it was easy for him to rule out he knew what he didn't want that's exactly yeah now is your other i mean we're talking about what you think but obviously you're experiencing it uh did your other son um yeah yeah right now yeah my other son is just as happy as a bed bug he the moment he knew he he decided early on that Amherst was the school he's a classical guitarist a clam oh wonderful and he decided he also got into the Yale graduate school of music as an undergraduate for classical guitar but he decided he was going to go to the um uh-huh the smaller and the the smaller now and then graduate school later and they'll do fine in their studies and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school and well he's really my older boy's real happy and he's minoring in English and he had thought about economics and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't and now he's a senior he's a senior or is this early admissions he'll be he's finishing his sophomore year so he's double majoring so he's so he's yeah well sounds like you have two talented sons well you know see the advice we give is to not limit yourself especially this you know go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two i think and a lot of people talk about and it's not the economics i'm solely zeroed in on but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return yeah and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges colleges because of that and i think it's rather sad well one of the things we said is that they should pick the college this was our advice too irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage you are wonderful parents well we place a real high priority on education in our family no and i agree i mean my husband and i in fact i'm taking my LSATs um i'm thirty something and taking my LSATs on June tenth oh good that's wonderful oh that's great um the point being and your sons will learn this from you i'm sure that uh no matter what age you are you can learn that's right that's exactly and it sounds like they're going to you know they're just  okay um i have two children and they're older now but um i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i taught school uh-huh and um i wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home and that's what i looked for and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school and that worked well that's good yeah that worked out real well but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation three i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and and be around kids their own age because i think that's um-hum that that would prepare them for school also it's real important that they do that um that they get that preparation for school yeah yeah uh-huh so but i had i have switched schools several times because i did i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school i wanted them to learn to play i didn't academics forced on them at an early age yeah i um that that's oh oh you mean you switched schools for the kids uh-huh yeah for the school for the kids yeah well well i'm just recently married so i don't have any children though we plan on having them soon but i think um uh-huh okay i think um that i that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties uh i think um i'm lucky though that um my wife will probably not have to work while our children are under four or five yeah because because i'm a college professor so and that's also and it's nice for me because um wonderful oh great most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week and then one or two evenings so that if my wife does um does go back to work part time um there probably will be a possibility that i could stay home two days that she would go to work and that i would have to teach at night oh that's wonderful yeah so it will probably workout real nice for us uh i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules i can even teach on Saturdays and and things like that yeah um i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding uh child care and one of the things they made in um uh real oh great they're number one priority was that um they're children didn't have to leave their home so they um um my sister-in-law is a uh oh that's wonderful too um a clinical speech pathologist so she is also i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work she applied for a director's position and and got it so i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess and even though she took off two years for um i guess four years all together it would be three years how old's Kayla three yeah i guess she took off three years all together um for because i guess they have a four year old and yeah and my nephew's two almost two so i guess she took off three all together and then when she decided to go back to work um uh-huh she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home oh that's wonderful yeah i think they were really lucky there but i think they've lost this woman she will she will not continue and and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school oh dear sure yeah so i don't know what they are going to do oh you know that's an ideal situation but not many people can afford something like that um-hum yeah i think i think they they're both they were both professionals unlike me they're um they'll my they were married my brother's five years younger then she is so she was probably twenty seven when they were married so she already had had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a profession in a practice almost um sure uh-huh um where you know he then they waited a couple years and and he got himself pretty far along i guess they didn't have kids until he was about twenty seven twenty six so by that time she was so well established you know i guess it made it a lot easier but uh i think the longer you wait the easier the easier it is if you have that sure oh i do too that professional occupation where you can change oh yeah but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that uh lucky um yeah no yeah that's right that's true yeah because i'm a single parent and i uh you know my husband and i ex-husband and i got a divorce um when the children were small and so i uh was a teacher i uh still am teacher and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was um-hum um-hum that was what i wanted where i could have piece of mind and when i taught school and i knew my kids were being taken care of yeah and plus i yep yeah definitely we're safe yeah i uh wanted them to get something out of it i just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and um-hum that's it yeah that's you know that's so important i um i i guess it's so funny now with schools you know they don't take kid into kindergarten and when i guess when they're five and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now and they don't let them into kindergarten unless they can right count to ten and they know their ABCs and i think that's so funny because um i don't i don't know if i want school's very important i'm an educator myself and my wife teaches and i it's a very important part of your life and i hope to read with my kids but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school at four or three you know i can see that that when you make that point i agree with that well the thing is i teach fifth grade and i i can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other children and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically because yeah uh-huh um-hum they were not they're should be there's to many things in their way and so i want my i wanted my children and they did learn to get to get along with other people yeah yeah uh-huh that's a really important point yeah and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults and i bet if we trace back to their early childhood we could see some yeah you know times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with people i think that's really that's important i i've seen the same thing i i think you're exactly right because you know i've gone out or before i was married i went out with a girl and you know um boy after you know after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems and i bet and they could be traced back to just not being uh you know being moved between uh-huh day care centers when she was one and two and three years old and never always being a bit snippy and spiteful i bet you could trace all the way back i bet you could too because it you know kids have to learn how to get along with other people and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really you know good adults or um-hum that's true successful adults i should say you know really uh-huh but uh it is a big problem and you know i have lot of friends right now that uh have young children and they daily have problems with with whoever is taking care of the child or th ey switch a lot which is not good for the child either um-hum yep that's true yeah that's really true uh so you need because you need that consistency when they're young like that and it would be ideal like you you hope when you have children your wife gets to stay home i would have have given anything if i would have been able to stay home with my children yeah you are um-hum yeah i i think i'm i'm very lucky um because of having you know flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule right especially i teach a computer classes so it's it's one of things where i'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor and i'm also um you know they have vocational type courses on weekends oh great um-hum almost everywhere and you know you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday which means that you know whole week's worth of courses so that lets you be available three days during the week oh that's wonderful oh that's good you know so you be will home with your kids i you know it's really funny is that i i picked this career when i was in college because uh i think with my commitment to family and um wanting to spend more time with my children you're very wise you know because my dad had very um nine to five type job with uh forty five minute commute into the city and a forty five commute home so by the time he got home he was so tired and he was all rung out from the day and i think he he missed a lot of um our up bringing you know my mother i i came from a family that that my mother stayed home until we started school um sure uh-huh um and i i don't uh it's funny i don't think she had to work until we started school i think teenagers become much more expensive oh don't they though that's what i have right now thirteen and a sixteen year old oh it is they really are expensive yeah for it it's probably costing you a fortune my goodness if if you want them to be able to drive the car the insurance bill the um exactly well and they most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars so oh you know right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son so that you know an older older older truck so i can afford it but you know um-hum yeah i i just look forward to him helping me out because i i for years just car driven carpools all over the place and carpools uh-huh yeah my parents did a lot of that and it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store will you take his sister somewhere or something like that that's right yep and just to save you trips to and from you know uh ball games and athletic events and activities at the school yeah isn't that something how you know you think about child care and it lasts along time right exactly right that's right it does forever it it lasts a long time and then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren so it's not ending is it you think we've talked a long a long enough time well normally they come in uh oh they come in see this is the first time i've done this oh oh cause they'll come in in ten minutes normally and stop us oh in ten minutes you have to talk that long well you don't have to but they they um you go the length and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes uh-huh oh depends on how old the tapes are at that time i see uh-huh i see are you from the where are you from yeah this is Baltimore Maryland oh my gosh i'm from uh Plano Texas which is which is outside of Dallas yeah well most of most of the people i talk to are from Texas yeah because that's where TI is that makes sense uh-huh yeah and i've discussed i've discussed um  all right um one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education because i went through the public um school system of Boston and uh uh-huh i always felt that i graduated high school and i still didn't even i i i couldn't put together a map of the United States hm uh-huh you know what i mean and yet i felt that i got a good education and and i did well in school but you tell me to name you know five continents and i couldn't do it i just feel like there are some real basics that are missing from education uh-huh huh and that people are are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things yeah when uh well talking about public education um i was just just i'm we're doing a proposal at we're doing at NC State um-hum yeah we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum um-hum so that's kind of at a higher level right so it's interesting that you chose that topic yeah um did you go through a a public school system or a private yeah well i went through private until ninth grade um-hum did you notice a big difference yeah oh yeah big difference like in what sense well um in uh public schools i guess there were there are a lot of you know people can take lower level courses and get away with learning nothing um-hum but um in private school you couldn't do that you know you had to learn um-hum yeah i work in a temporary agency and there are people that come in you know everyday to fill out an application and uh-huh they'll have to bring somebody with them and they will show that they completed um four years of high school yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application huh they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves it's bad it's just incredible yeah our state just cut a whole bunch of uh like think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget really so we're making all kinds of cuts in college people cannot i mean the teachers can't make tests anymore and the the library's canceling all it's subscription yeah it's pretty sorry i know um they uh i forget what i think it's um someplace in New York because they're having budget problems they're closing the libraries uh-huh yeah i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports huh or anything like that they're not cutting in any other corner they're closing the libraries that to me shows a little uh switch in priorities you know and uh yeah so do you go to college right now are you in yeah it's my last year you're so you're a senior now yeah i'm working on my projects trying to graduate oh good for you that's great um is is NC University is that uh uh state what'd you say yeah NC State NC State NC State that's a state university then i see and you're from there also yeah well yeah i was uh i was born in Raleigh and then i lived in Winston-Salem rest of my life um-hum i see so now i'm back here going to school well pretty soon it's gonna get to the point where no one's gonna be able to afford to send their kids to college or to go to college yeah it's just outrageously expensive luckily State's the cheap one of the cheap ones oh is it well still though i mean you know thousands of dollars yeah yeah state's not that bad oh well that's good that's good i went to a private university and um yeah i i don't know i look back now and i i think that i probably would've done it differently if i um you know could do it over again but um yeah i i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school some some of them and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did i really do and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say but um i don't know i i what yeah where'd you go where did you go sorry i went to Brandeis University it's in Massachusetts uh-huh and um i i really felt like i've been working now for about four years uh-huh and i i feel like what what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable than what i learned in school huh and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on learned but um i don't know my sister's a principal at a school and one thing that she's trying to instill in kids um besides just reading and writing um are just some the golden rules she calls them just some basics about um you know you don't take what's not yours um-hum uh and and if you want to you know you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission like no hitting you know no pulling hair or anything like that um-hum and uh the school that she's in is a um it's basically for minorities um there's uh a large minority population and um um-hum she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get in some yeah that's sorry that that that they like pick on you know that the advanced stud ents and pay more attention to them ignore the others yeah it's true um-hum yeah and i don't know if it makes them feel better i mean do teachers get i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking somebody that wasn't as successful yeah and seeing what they could do versus somebody that you know did excel in in areas and just watching them get better you know that's not much of a challenge yeah that's true but are do you have any idea what you're gonna go into when you graduate um graduate school yeah oh yeah do you know where yo u're going i think i'm going to Chapel Hill where's that that's in Chapel Hill that's the name yeah never heard of the Tarheels oh is that North Carolina oh okay no i don't know that area the ACC Tarheels UNC i don't know it oh well i don't get down there very often they were in the final four don't watch basketball oh really well the way i pick the final four was um by the the state that had the warmest climate uh-huh so that's how i chose all mine so you can tell that i didn't really have that much to do with any of it but so obviously you're into education if you can be going my husband went to is in graduate school actually right now no yeah uh-huh and uh i don't know i give you a lot of credit i i couldn't do it i i couldn't wait to graduate and have it be all over yeah i know ah i can't wait to graduate either now i got all these stuff due oh wow i know yeah i kind of know what you mean overloaded well it was really nice talking to you okay good luck alrighty take care bye-bye all right all right thank you all right bye  do you have uh personal experience involving child care services well about the only thing i know is uh one of my um friends at work uh has um one little boy and she's about to have a second baby and i hear some of her um tales about trying to get uh child care now she doesn't like to use some of the places like um Kinder Care La Petite Academy she likes to just find individuals you know who take children into their home right uh-huh and uh you know sometimes they have found somebody by word of mouth other times she has to go through the newspaper and see what she can find there are some um like um oh Chamber of Commerce you can kind of call there are some places like that that will give you some referrals at least but she just kind of goes and uh meets people that she sees advertise and and interviews with them and ask them their i have a friend at work yeah who whose wife does that she takes in kids and i think they're regulated by the state as to how many they can take in at one time ways oh ah so i'm not sure how anybody checks up on that but um i think there's a maximum number of kids that they can take care of at any one time yeah there's been a few people that have kind of used the same person kind of like word of mouth one person in the department had them and then um you know other people had followed and had the same one as their child grows like some people only want little infants you know and when they get to two years old they don't want you know a whole lot of two years old because they're a little more active so they you know a lot people in the department seem to have used like the same couple of woman as their their children uh grow but yeah i really keep thinking that T I ought to come up with something like through Texins to have you know some kind of facilities there at work because it really is uh a lot of extra pressure on our working parents do you think it ought to be subsidized by the company no i think it should be done through Texans i mean i understand that something you can sign up for and pay that that TI wouldn't want to have liability for that and i can understand that i work in the legal department i don't want anymore lawsuits than what we got sure right no i don't think that the company should be subsidizing services like that but but you know i think they could work out something with Texans something that would be close to work because i think that would help ease things too if you've got your child somewhere close because i see these people you know dashing out the door um have to be out by a certain time because they have to go pick up their child if they don't pick up the child by a certain time then they run extra money you know to uh have late charges sure and uh you know Texins is is not uh well i don't think it's really directly supported by TI i think it has it's own kind of funding but something like that that you know you would have to be a TI or a Texins kind of um does it yeah i think that would take care of any questions about competency for people running the show uh if say if you were in in a situation having to locate a uh child care center how old you go about determining whether somebody was competent or not take care of your kids i think that's a big question well how would i do that yeah you um pretty much by word of mouth uh somebody recommends somebody else but if you didn't know anybody uh how how lengthy an interview would you conduct with the person taking care of your kids to determine whether they're fit to uh handle it well uh again i know from the person who um you know is a friend ever mine at work she and i i've talked to her after she's interviewed some people just really sound i mean bizarre i mean you can't imagine that these people are putting in for um you know minding other children um like if you could go to the house and it seems to be in a disarray and the woman really isn't even dressed and it's afternoon and and you ask her about you know previous children and she won't talk about it yeah uh-huh kind of go okay um others if they have some way of handling like i kind of wonder about these women who take in children there are times that you're going to have to do you know for the women they're going to have to do some personal things themselves i mean every single day they may have you know every once in a while they may have some kind of um personal doctor appointment or got to get the car fixed or something like that how do they do that so you ask them do you have a fall back you know for those times are you going to put me in a bind or do you have somebody else who can take care of the kids or do those things for you on the times that you need to you know have personal time off and do those items yeah and ask them you know who else uh have they you know baby sat for in the past and can you talk to them look at the facilities and ask them what kind of things they do to you know during the day with the child that kind of thing i guess yeah there there are some services that uh that are very expensive uh for uh typically subsidized by uh large companies for some of their uh uh important employees uh-huh where if they can't get there regular uh sitter or a child care service to take there kids if they reserve slots with these other um companies um very expensive rates but they can drop their kid off uh at uh one of these places for so it i don't know what it cost but it's extremely expensive and the companies uh have to uh reserve X number of slots uh per year they can't send anymore it's it's pretty much for for their hm hm for their uh uh some some of their employees uh lawyers do that a lot um i've heard about this type of service in uh places like New York City where people are uh real busy but if uh uh-huh if they can't find the regular sitter they they if the company has uh slots available in this service uh these employees can drop their kids off there hm oh do you know one time i um we just got married a couple of years ago and there was people that were coming you know into town with uh children and i wanted you know babysitters for uh the service and and available to them if they didn't want to bring their children or you know get away and stuff and i just called in the from the Yellow Pages you know a babysitter outfits that are um again must have some kind of licensing or whatnot and uh just had them i mean what i did was i had a babysitter during the service you know and and um anybody who had children could just you know take the child to the nursery and i had somebody there everybody i knew was going to be at the wedding so i knew i had to find somebody i didn't know to do that yeah um and it worked out okay i didn't know that there were services that you just called the Yellow Pages and uh there's babysitters are us or something and you say please i need one you know oh yeah no problem we'll send you out one great uh-huh do you have any idea what uh what the regular uh uh services cost like La Petite or Kinder Care uh i thought i checked into it one time just pre planning and it can run like a hundred dollars a week i think my friend who now has a uh uh a two and a half year old she spends about fifty to sixty dollars per week for him so i think it's anywhere from like fifty to a hundred depending on the place you take i guess you have to weigh the financial benefit of having somebody else take care of your kids if uh the working wife can uh make uh more than enough to handle that expense i guess it's worthwhile yeah yeah it gets to be kind of expensive and i think you know some of the woman do uh weigh that um we've had some that have had their children and not come back so it just depends i think uh well we have one now who um is is part time she works half days well actually we have two one paralegal and one secretary and one attorney each have very young children and now they are part timing it is kind of like a test to see how this will work to have these people work part time uh-huh uh depending on the responsibilities that we're giving them and to see how that will workout because they all want to you know still have a little income to help out financially but they want to spend time with their children so they're part timers yeah and it for the one that's working with me it's working uh very well i don't have any problem with that i have one that's um helping me out at um for the litigation we're doing and she's there uh three days a week and this that seems to be fine i can handle that very well with her being there only half time uh-huh i know some woman who are very career minded as soon as they have their kids they're back at work the next week but next week yeah pretty much so but other other than that i know some also who's claim is that after they have their kids or started having kids they're going to quit their job and uh dedicate their time to raising the kids right according in in putting it in their words oh and staying at home so i don't know i guess each way has it's advantages yeah well it's whatever they feel comfortable with you know basically whatever they feel best and there's probably some women who may not do their child any good being there all the time because you know they they they can't uh quite see themselves you know dedicated that much maybe they want to work a little bit whatever it is maybe they should think about do you really want a child or not uh-huh yeah good question and maybe again you know their their you know their ideas change once the baby is there they go oh well you know now i like this a lot more than i thought i would uh-huh but uh Cathlene the part timer she says you know she just doesn't she she's always one of these workaholic kind of people and she just really can't sit still enough to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in you know like the fifty to sixty hour work week and after she had the baby she was coming back in to check her office and to check her in box you know like ten days later she was back in and we were like Cathlene you got two months off you know you don't have to be back in there she's just always back in there and she's a she she just finds it very hard to um you know tone that down even though she's a part timer she still will put in time on Saturday uh-huh  well um i'm uh pretty pro gun control over all i um have had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control and uh i must say that there are a couple of arguments against uh strong gun control which i find very compelling although most of the people who argue gun control with me i find um use sort of canned arguments you know sort of the NRA slogan arguments and um uh so i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it um i guess on a one a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns and i have to admit most of that is uh strong personal distaste i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very very little effort um and uh guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me well me being from Texas um-hum i hope you're ready for this um i'll i'll give it a try i've got my Texan stereotypes in place well i'm not your stereotypical Texan i was raised around guns hunting uh-huh so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect i respect i respect them and what their capabilities are um-hum um-hum and on top that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military as a Green Beret i definitely respect the power of weaponry um-hum it's pretty powerful isn't it and here in Houston as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country and here here here you go here you this will be border line NRA which i am not a member of okay okay i mean you i know you've heard this this slogan um if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns um-hum that applies to anything as well as guns a gun well you've you've got well any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such um-hum they get out their little Mac ten's they get out there little Uzis and they're going to fight with them and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm if they want it they'll get it i don't care if if they've got to go down in New Mexico to get it they'll get it and they'll get across the border now my position although i have absolutely no use for fully automatic weapon anyway um-hum since i am a law-abiding citizen and i have never had a felony if i wanted to buy one i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it if they want to run a background check on me fine if they want to put a seven day waiting period fine again um-hum if they want to have want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county that's fine too um-hum um-hum what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it's it wouldn't you don't want to have someone making a personal choice in that way i would hope i mean because that means someone the personal sheriff doesn't like doesn't get to have a gun and someone the personal sheriff well the only well the criteria the sheriff would have to follow has is this guy a convicted felon uh is he a habitual trouble maker are we picking him up every Saturday night for a drunk and disorderly and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems yeah you know just proving that you're a basically a good citizen but if you're not a very if you're not a basically good citizen you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway if if they want the firepower they can get it so why have it doesn't it doesn't matter how restrictive you're border control points are they'll get it across the border one way or the other so why have any restrictions at all uh okay now go back to that one to ten scale where one being total gun control ten being none i said about an eight uh-huh yeah um-hum um-hum well we could be i said the restrictions i would like to see on for anybody whether it being for handgun a rifle a shotgun i would like to see them go through either i'd like to see a law enforcement agency not NRA but whether it be the your state police or your county police for you to be able to purchase a handgun you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon how to safely handle the weapon how to properly maintain it the three basics well that makes a lot of since to me i mean i certainly feel that if if we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm but uh i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm they have as much responsibility to know how to do use it safely as someone learns how to drive if not more so well the hands in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as a weapon as a as a pistol yeah well i'm a bicycler and that scares me too to tell you the truth because i've been run off the road and all sorts of things well i'm still i'm still puzzled though what is the argument how does the argument work if uh if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway what's the point of putting a restriction basically the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway they're not going to take those courses is it uh is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns well there's if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices is that uh main advantage uh not necessarily a price thing what is happening at least in this state and i expect to see it in other states very soon legislation's been introduced as that if a citizen of the state being myself um-hum has not committed a felony and has completed a certified weapons course i can carry a weapon on me at all times concealed or unconcealed unconcealed um-hum okay you you're you're from California right LA area um-hum uh no Bay area San Francisco Bay area okay okay you've been to the city all these people coming around um-hum someone attempts to mug me i would just i would as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade um-hum now if this legislation comes through he pulls i'm out with my family we've gone shopping we're fixing to get in the car this guy comes out pulls a blade on me i'm going to pull a gun on him now um-hum when you're looking and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick what if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon then it's still equally matched i having spent having spent time in combat i feel i feel it before they'll get the gun on me yeah well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that if i'm we'll draw at the same time you know you'd if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have good you know u h far far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything um i'm quite concerned that if you let everyone who hasn't yet used a gun in a felony uh haven't hasn't yet committed a felony if you let them all walk around carrying guns in this sort of wild west scenario you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire it's it's hard for me to imagine that a a situation of you know take it to it's logical extreme if everyone walking around carrying guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire i actually it's not it's more of a police action in itself the fact that everybody's packing a piece is a deterrent is a deterrence to someone saying well i'm going to mug this guy right here but hey he carrying just as much firepower as i can and if there's if you got to go through a certification course to get to where to where you can carry it in public um-hum then this individual also knows this guy's pretty good with it now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not that's another trip but um-hum um-hum um-hum in defense of myself defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat um-hum even even more so when it comes to my my wife and son anybody tries anybody tries to hurt them i won't even blink yeah don't it no i i understand that what if uh what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake this this is where the question of gun control comes in what i consider gun control is being able to hit my target with the first shot yeah well uh that was the topic um-hum say a person uh starts uh uh get all of a sudden my combat antenna goes up and say i've got the vibes this guy's fixing to do something i go ahead and pull my piece um-hum and i make sure this persons sees it so he's got no doubt that i will use it on him and i will use it right then um-hum if he doesn't back up that point he deserves what he gets because i have sent the clearest signal you mess with me you mess with my family i'm going to dust you as it stands now i've got to do that with a blade and the only reason i feel confident comfortable comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had um-hum um-hum well as as someone who would would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander i feel more comfortable with people having blades because uh you're not going to get bullets flying around and killing people instantly and uh well if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss that's the kind of training i've had i mean it's  here we go okay okay Janet could you tell me what your thoughts are well i think the idea of public uh health services is a good one i think that we all um perhaps have a civic duty but i don't know as though it should be uh and i don't know if this uh was my interpretation was that perhaps it should be uh like a forced thing um i think it should all be voluntary as it is now but um i do agree that i think it is a good thing because i don't know how else a lot of these um things could happen if they didn't have the volunteers to do it yeah they uh um the example they gave was like the Peace Corps um-hum uh i'm not so sure if i i agree with that see uh back in Roosevelt's administration they had the CCC camps um-hum and i don't know about down in your area but like up here they built bridges and they built uh uh waterways leading from reservoirs to reservoirs to get to the city um-hum in fact in my area it's it's kind of a rural area and it's and the waterways are still in place you know they're uh they're beautiful they're all stone walled and it it just leads from the reservoirs way up in the hills and it just leads down into other reservoirs some of the bridges are still standing too i mean some of them need repair now um-hum but because of the recession back then or the depression whatever you want to call it uh there was a lot of people out of work so the government brought them in i mean they they performed a a public service uh-huh but yet they were paid for it too well that's true and of course there was the need there and they didn't have any other resource and and uh i guess it it served it's purpose right right is that what it was meant to do but as you say they were paid and i'm not all that familiar with the Peace Corps although i have friends who have family members that are in it and um um they generally go abroad and and uh serve but they don't get a salary and they give up uh X number of years of their lives to do this right yeah but they must get some compensation somewhere um i know some people that just came back from South America and uh they they are degreed and once they got their degrees they're a married couple and they went off they got uh some they got some compensation but it wasn't a whole lot uh was was it like a sabbatical yeah more like a sabbatical i would imagine and uh i guess a lot of it was a learning experience for them i i imagine it takes just different kinds of people yeah and now they're uh back in school so maybe they're people in the beginning that just want to be in a constant learning environment i i don't know uh yeah like yeah but uh yeah i think i think we need it in this country yes i i agree i so much so many of our things are going outside the country to benefit other nations and okay that's fine but what about here right we're uh you know you know we're supposedly on the leading edge of technology which uh that can be disputed i guess by a number of other countries um i do now that our rapid transit system uh is in terrible shape i mean most areas of the country we don't have anything um-hum where overseas uh they do their rail lines their their uh their subways are in much better condition than ours if we put if we put a force to work in this country building a network of rapid transit systems you know just from say outlying districts of downtown especially California where the i saw a program on uh PBS last night they're saying the average um-hum the average speed on the California freeways now in southern California is thirty six miles an hour and it's roughly uh a two hour wait to get from the outskirts of downtown um-hum and they figure by five years the average speed is going to be eleven miles an hour i'll be that's that's atrocious you know maybe we've um got a turn around here maybe in the beginning we thought it wasn't such a good idea but perhaps if we instrumented it here in the US rather than taking all that manpower out of the US and providing a service for people to join here and do some good we could come up with some of those things we have we have a lot of people that are in college and we have a lot of people that for one reason or another that that can't get into college either they can't afford it or or perhaps they don't have the abilities um-hum that's all more manpower and and one of the ways where we're we were coping with that was they were going into the military and they were getting a semblance of an education right now the military's laying off um-hum uh i think there should be mandatory that people that are not in school should at least get into some kind of a career program i mean they can help build the United States back up that's uh that's a good thought now see i hadn't thought about it that way my first uh thought was when they mentioned that was to people who go abroad and do service abroad and perhaps there might be as you say more of an effort here needed yeah and we've done we've sent people abroad and the people that do go abroad are are usually um college educated yes that's true they're taking the knowledge that we have and bringing it with them which is which is fine because in the long run if we educate those people and we build up their economy they're going to want to buy products that we make um-hum so but i don't know if that if that is really taken place like the Philippines with the the massive corruption in there i mean a few people got it and the rest of didn't yes the Middle East same thing a few people got it and and the rest of them don't so in theory if you build up their economies and help these people yes it can work but the corruption at the top i think limits that i agree it doesn't always work that way the way it was intended and then the people change in this country too and not and are not able to see it through our administration changes also yeah so yeah i'm kind of uh a dreamer i guess i still i still believe in we could put this country back to work we could bring the steel mills back in we could we could build our own rails we could we could create all kinds of jobs um-hum if we just had the incentive like um i'm not sure who started the national highway system you know the the freeways um-hum i don't know if it was if it was if it was Johnson or Kennedy or sometime before them the way they decided that yes we're going to have uh i guess we've got some of the best roads in the world we could do that too i mean we could we could get a national program Kennedy had a national program to land uh a man on the moon um-hum and we did it so i i think if we if we put our minds to it we can do just about anything we want yeah sounds like i'm on a soapbox i i think i'm inclined but it's been interesting it's been an interesting soapbox so yeah there's i just i just remember how it used to be and it seems like that um-hum everything's just deteriorating you know you you can't go anywhere without waiting in line you can't um now i thought that was just a sign of the times we're all stressed out that's what they're trying to tell us that that we now get upset because we have to wait in line or wait in traffic but in in reality there's so much more traffic and so many more lines and really like you say something needs to be done about that too yeah it just seems to be a waste of time um-hum i mean it takes it takes longer and longer to get back and forth to work um-hum we're adding to the pollution in the in the world whether that's creating the greenhouse effect or not whether it is or not uh it's still being debated apparently uh if we could get like we were discussing some people involved in this country like they want to be involved in other countries maybe we could do some some real good here you know and not take so long to do it yeah i think it could happen it could the the main thing is um like you said earlier in the conversation if we make it a mandate and say you have to do it then we're going to create all kinds of problems that's very true but i don't see why we can't say that i don't see why we can't you know you contribute well you don't go to school well spend two years doing something or put these people that are in prison you know we have a welfare system that is defeating itself because they get more money from welfare than they can working at ordinary jobs that's very true so what's the incentive for them to go to work yes exactly the prison population right that's there's i don't know how many millions of people now are incarcerated um-hum which is uh which is a huge drain on society um-hum what do you do with those people and supposedly we're uh reeducating them and putting them back out in the public so give them some public service yeah but are we really doing that educating i i suppose some i don't know i i suppose to somebody's way of thinking we are but um i know that when they do get out the majority of them aren't able to find jobs are they or get back into society because they have that stigmatism no that's right and as much as you say yes you know i've paid my debt to society and all that it's still there um-hum and they're going to be apprehensive and if you had to choose between one or the other you know you wouldn't you just wouldn't look at those people that's very true if you had uh uh a public health organization in the US that took and say a lot of the  do you have a recipe that you would like to share why don't you start first and i'll think about it okay uh we i find that the nicest party for dinner uh uh group for a dinner party is eight people uh they set at my dining room table easily and it just seems like you can decorate a table and and you can serve easily with eight people uh particularly if you're wanting to do the soup to nuts thing which uh with my dishes i have a really pretty soup tureen so i like to start out with you know some kind of soup that nobody's had lately like sauerkraut soup or minestrone depending upon what the menu theme is um-hum but one thing that i like to do um of course i always want to make it easy on the cook and uh the lady who is the manager of the country club gave me a really good recipe for ham loaf that it's something you can make up ahead and then stick in the oven you know yeah um-hum after after your guests are here and you've started cocktails really uh usually course you have to have some kind of entertainment too and and we do play bridge my husband plays when i make him and uh well usually our friends the women are the bridge players and the men are there because it's an excuse to get together um-hum but i do find that in in order to have your party last beyond the dinner table there have there does have to be something to go on to or you just kind of sit around and everybody goes to sleep and gets bored you know there's got to be a a silly game or a something fun to do afterwards yeah um-hum i would say our dinners are probably more casual than that with um having kids and that kind of stuff it may be inviting you know neighbors over for dinner or something like that but not really we haven't really tried a dinner party i guess um-hum you have more summer than we do though yeah or a barbecue or something like that yeah yeah we can do that well starting the end of this well starting now we can do that through October but that's about it for us and then we're basically inside you know even if it's really warm during the day at night it's going to cool off and by the time you would get ready to eat you're going to want to be in um-hum right yeah so our climate is not as conducive to the outdoor entertaining as yours are although it's certainly a lot more casual and a lot more fun yeah yeah keeps the kids busy too gives the grown-ups a chance to well like you said play a game or just talk or something like that right i yeah and i think outside you can just kind of kick back and and visit after dinner but is seems like when you're inside the first thing you know someone has turned on a TV and that kind of is the end of your party i think yeah that's true yeah what do you do uh for a barbecue when you cook out what's your favorite thing well i guess we i we lived in Kansas City for awhile and it was kind of fun to do Mexican food up there because a lot of people didn't really yeah hadn't had it before and i know um we were going to make um fajitas one time and the grocery stores i mean the people knew when i asked for the beef skirt that you use to make it they said are you from Texas so it's fun oh i see you're you're even labeled by your food how do you do fajitas yeah well it you can either use we've always used um beef skirt steak but you can also use flank steak and you marinate it the recipe i've used is you marinate it in a can of beer and a bottle of Italian dressing and then you can either grill uh-huh eight ounce and then you can either grill it or you can um broil it we usually grill it outside and then you cut it into real small real thin pieces and serve it on flour tortillas with like grated cheese and sour cream and guacamole and that type of thing um-hum i've i've i love Mexican and i'm always doing the hot things and i make my own salsa and all that and it's really spicy but i just haven't had the nerve to try fajitas how large a steak would you need to serve eight people um-hum i think i was reading looking at this recipe we're going to have some guests in in a couple of weeks and they said recommend a pound for four people i think three to four people yeah so i'd need two pounds wouldn't i one pound four people and then is that a fairly thick steak or it it's kind of a thin steak oh and so it doesn't take very long to to grill uh-huh so when you when you get it you don't have your meat man cut it to a certain width you just take whatever you find okay flank or skirt yeah okay okay i'm i've been wanting to try that and i just haven't got the nerve up i do tacos and enchiladas and all that stuff but yeah um-hum okay a can a sixteen ounce can of beer and then you mix eight ounces of Italian dressing with it do you let the beer get flat or well you just um well i usually just put it like in a Pyrex pan you know i have an eight by or a nine by thirteen pan i put it in there and i pour it over the top and then you just you know turn it leave it in there for overnight or something and turn it every once in awhile um um-hum maybe i usually cover it with Saran wrap or something and then or start it in the morning and it's ready in the evening to cook um-hum you know something i do when i marinate steak that you might think is interesting i have a tupperware uh sealed or any plastic sealed and then i just turn it over every once in awhile um-hum oh yeah and it saves you know it's just easy just to turn the whole dish over the whole container over the whole yeah yeah okay yeah so you do grated cheese and guacamole that would make it nice and easy and some people like sour cream and then you like warm your um flour tortillas up in the oven okay uh-huh okay where did i write the part about the tortillas warm the tortillas i usually just wrap them up in foil or something like that and stick them in the oven for awhile yeah okay in fact as a wedding gift we got a tortilla warmer but i don't think very many people have those and it doesn't hold very many tortillas so we don't use that often i see uh-huh i'm sure you'd probably i mean the men would eat two and the women would eat one isn't that usually how that goes probably yeah because once you get the meat in there it gets pretty filling uh-huh yeah what about salsa you can or you can't or you just don't usually put salsa on it you know oh you can yeah i i'm not into the hot hot food my my husband is but i'm not so i see well we have our children all three live here and our two married daughters have three children between them who range from eight to three and every time they and they always come here for every holiday it seems and birthdays and and every time we always have to start up with something really hot and spicy as an hors d'oeuvres and it gets to be um-hum both our son sons-in-law are good cooks and enjoy cooking and it kind of gets to be a contest to see who can come up with the the hottest yeah right the hottest almost not eatable hors d'oeuvres to start us out so well it's fun take talking to you i'm going to try fajitas oh well good well it's nice talking to you where do you live in Indiana i have some relatives that live up um near Terre Haute oh okay well we're way up the other end of the state we're uh half way between Chicago and Indianapolis on i sixty five so and Terre Haute is you know it's like three hours south yeah well i know when we flew up there we flew into Indianapolis and then had to drive down there so yeah um-hum yeah this is a little town of five thousand just a perfect little town for us retired people and for raising children and yeah you know you can go away for a week and you come home and say what happened and they say oh nothing so it's a pretty good spot well have a nice day bye bye well thank you you too bye  well i personally don't have any problem with uh drug testing employees or potential employees do you um i mean basically basically no um um okay i don't i really can't disagree with it yeah i i uh uh the policy that TI has i think is uh uh very fair uh-huh um i they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees and then since i've been with them the last four years uh there's been in the last year year and a half um they're doing random testing of all employees uh-huh i think that's really the only fair way to do it yes i really think it ought to be some you know Junkins all the way down and it is it and from from what i understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isn't that a fact i've been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year uh-huh uh-huh before i retired so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldn't object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it yeah um i like it because um you know i i i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and and uh you know i i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who weren't and and uh you know it's i think it's a real problem oh i absolutely and i think it and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems yeah uh-huh and so i'm hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path i don't think they'll have much choice do you um probably not especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know some do some sort of you know drug testing i think that's really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh uh-huh Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing yeah i used to be in DSEG myself um A P D as a matter of fact yeah so you knew you know the atmosphere then yep very aware of it but i i'd i'd i really like the idea uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing i mean i'd like i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or that's right or uh who might be at a point where they're trying to sell my kid drugs that's right absolutely yeah i don't i just can't disagree with you with you know the basic premise yeah it's to much as far as i know it's you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up that's right that's right and offer you you know help if you need help yeah yeah yeah i do too yeah rather than just uh put you out on the street put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself yeah that's right that's not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem no absolute that's right um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too oh absolutely not to mention alcohol yeah so i mean there's a lot of things out there and things that uh i'm just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise they'd be legal and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco that's right that's right oh gosh well it's it's a real problem i'm sure yeah i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and i uh uh i moved to a TI facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before uh-huh because they were outside of the military sector it was uh an industrial company and you know that TI purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it right uh-huh oh yeah uh-huh uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and that's why they were opposed to it uh-huh uh-huh that's right and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving uh-huh you know because they just flat out weren't going to put up with the policy uh-huh you know they had a lifestyle and they weren't going to change it yep right yeah i know a lot of people who and it's when it first began or at least began was in the talking stage you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs of course yeah yeah i mean uh you should have no objection to it it's like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see that's right that's right yep yep why are we doing this well so you don't kill people on the road that's right or yourself or uh it's a basic i mean it's the basic premise with you know drug testing yeah that's right especially some of the jobs um luckily i've always been in the engineering sector and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it uh-huh uh-huh yeah that's true but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff uh-huh yeah assembly people yeah i darn if i'd want somebody down there that i'm working with side by side you know that could kill me that's right by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs absolutely so there's a there's a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit uh-huh oh absolutely yeah i mean if you have uh you know if you're not working with someone on drugs well then you're going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the company's more profitable uh-huh yeah sure well then the company's more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere sure trickles trickles up and down yep all over sure does and uh yeah affects a lot of people it certainly does and yeah i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball and and start it up uh-huh i think they probably will you know if they i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer i'm not sure every small company could do it well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits you know reduction reduction in in medical costs if you know they uh-huh yeah yeah it's got to help them too yeah so i think everybody will will benefit from the program uh-huh yeah i do too that's right and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh uh-huh uh-huh mandatory drug testing we'll reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent they're going to reduce their own uh-huh no no but it it'll save in some areas yeah right yeah and that'll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh as part of the package that's right that certainly could happen that's a very very very very competitive business yeah so it i i think i think all around it it's going to help out a lot course yeah i do too i just really can't disagree with you yeah okay well it's nice to talk to you it was great talking with you and you take care you do the same okay bye-bye bye-bye  well i don't know i mean i don't know what you think about this subject i the i had never really thought of what they said before about allowing the the sentencing to uh to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while we was waiting for them to find somebody and i don't know that that's not a good idea that's not a bad idea i um uh that you know they probably need to change it somehow uh the whole system needs changing we've just got too many people in there and uh i agree docket and are putting too many uh people in jail that probably don't need to be there and it's another form of sentencing but on that one thing i i still think it should be a unanimous decision uh i think we're getting to the point now where they're gonna eventually let it be um majority vote uh-huh oh yeah i agree yeah and that's not gonna be good no i don't like that no i don't like that at all i know my husband served on a on a jury a few months ago up here in Denton that uh was a guy it was it was a drug conviction and i don't remember he had some cocaine and it it was accused of selling it and i don't remember exactly how much he had but uh actually not selling it there's a difference couriering couriering it is what and and there's supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier if he was a courier and um right they he he sat on that jury and they found him guilty and they went through the sentencing phase and everything and uh you know they were told that you know during the trial that this is this guy's first offense and he's got this clean record and and they ended up the jury you know decided hey it's time to crackdown here you know and it's time to to do this drug thing and let's crackdown and let's really and they sentenced him to fifteen years you know which they thought first offense okay this is they thought that that was that was a good thing and they sentencing him to fifteen years and um after it was all over uh the judge they sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers uh-huh let me come over in just a second okay and sat down with the judge and with the other two lawyers and they were told that uh he would probably serve three um-hum um-hum of the fifteen and that he had three previous convictions however they could not tell the judge the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal oh yeah so the jury didn't know about it so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense and so you know we'll give him fifteen which'll teach him a lesson but it's not just sure you know horrible since it was first offense and he'd been convicted three times before you know and and the jury was very upset and my husband came home at home very upset i mean he felt like that that they had been tricked you know and so yeah yeah right that something i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change you know yeah and the judge might know or at least it it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better if it didn't we can come back for something else or or or what we've got so well we definitely need a change in the system and uh that's true that's very true yeah yeah obviously what we're doing is not working you know no it's not working too it's just piling up on us yeah and there's you know there's people in our prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way shape or form and either they're in there forever or when they get out they're you know it's a matter of a few months and they're gonna be right back for the same thing so the system right right yeah we're just not willing to as a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes yeah that's very true yeah i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day and i said you know i understand that there are a lot of countries that rely on the United States right to and and and the people in those countries rely on our money to survive but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves i mean we and and it would i know people say oh it would be cruel to you know pull our aid from these other countries and and maybe so so tell them you've got five years right right to work out a plan to make it on your own yeah and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we're cut it down seventy to seventy five you know seventy five percent and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years um-hum it should by then you should all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help sure and then we'll have all we'll have we will have the money if we would do that to to work on our own system because we've got some serious problems here and we're trying to heal the world you know it's just not very true yeah oh yeah you're very accurate it's just not working i look at the i look at what you know this what the aid we're sending to the Kurds and i i feel sorry for them and i know they're suffering and i know they're dying every day but we've got you know kids here in the United States that are dying every day too you know and being sure oh abused and neglected and you know i don't know i just have this problem with yeah trying to heal the world when you're so sick yourself you know so right well we seem to agree on the jury thing and uh but uh we'll need an unanimous verdict and maybe let the judge have a opportunity to make the sentence yeah yeah i think we should try it like you say if it doesn't work we can always come back but i think it would be a good idea to try it i do too so anyway well we all agree you too bye-bye well good good to hear from you bye-bye  okay well you so do you have any pets um we got two cats two cats yeah and uh um yeah we had cat you know my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies so i mean i'm used i'm used to having cats around i like them uh-huh yeah i like having cat cats around or pets around in general i i favor dogs over cats actually but oh see i'm not uh i'm not a dog person at all oh i'm i'm a dog person i had i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid right yeah probably i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid in fact i may still be um we uh-huh but not cats not um i wonder sometimes um but we um we house sat for a um my um my wife's boss a couple weeks ago and um uh-huh uh he has a dog and everything we were you know we were sitting the dog and everything and uh i felt like just miserable all weekend and it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday it was like hey maybe you're still allergic to the dog it was like oh that could be it well the thing i don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek yeah of the dogs and constantly well dogs are real high maintenances you got to take them for walks and you've got to pay a lot you know you need to pay attention to cats and everything but it's not quite the same thing um and um yeah that's true um you know it's it's just nice that cats you know cats yeah you don't have to let them outside you know our cats are indoor cats so you know they're not you worry you're not worried about them running all around the neighborhood and you know they you know they they make their mess in the cat pan which is uh-huh limited yeah it's you know it's a pain to clean but you know we used to i mean they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' pans they didn't oh really well when i was you know when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs and you know and use this thing to you know scoop the take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything it was really terrible but now they have like this you get these liners uh-huh that is garbage bags you know and you and you you know the oh that sounds so easy what i did yeah the cats do it in there you pull it and take it out and throw it away and that's it yeah i house sat some cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis and what we used to do was just put um newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing uh-huh same idea then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there everyday oh okay i see uh-huh because if i put a lot one of the cats would had been all of her animals that she ever had were adopted is that true yeah she's even got she's got one dog now and the two cats and her uh-huh dog there is is basically a reject somebody had bought him and wanted him it was her ex boyfriend and you know just was not mature enough to keep the dog didn't realize how much work it was and now she's stuck with it and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals uh-huh uh-huh but i think that for me well my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat because that's all there is to it so you know so you don't have anything right now no we don't have anything right now oh except the kid huh that's oh right now we have a kid but he was no completely against having a dog or cat he said they're much they're as much work as a kid and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend and uh i don't i don't know because the cats pretty much um yeah you know we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out uh-huh and um uh it's not a big deal really i mean they're they're happier when we're around but you know they they're pretty much okay by themselves um and i don't you know we couldn't do that with a dog that's uh yeah really true but like the friends other friends of mine have cats they have four of them and if they go away they have they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that and their cats you know their so use to the attention that if they don't get it they get really upset and you know they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that well that's that's um pampering the the pet a little yeah i i tried to have um figured having pets so i tried to have a goldfish uh-huh and um i killed that one within a very short amount of time but they're not that much fun you know you can't take them for a walk you can't you know they they don't they can't fetch you know they can't they can't do anything so i've never right i think we had fish when i was a kid but i don't my brother had fish when i was a kid i remember that and one of his fish jumped out of the um gosh what do you call it fish tank and fried itself on the radiator behind the dresser i'll never forget that because i remember my brother he came home and he counted the fish and one of the fish was missing and they couldn't find it anyplace they couldn't figure out what had happened and then they found it fried on the radiator behind uh well it was not that gross i didn't see it but um he got them trying to remember we had a dog for a while oh and i don't know if we got rid of the dog because my brother was allergic to it my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards and then he had fish uh-huh uh-huh and you they're like you say they're not the most exciting pet to have no it's like i just i don't know i i just never understood why what the attraction i mean they're you know they're pretty and everything but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish it's not as much fun well a friend of mine had um an eel and then he had a um i forget what type of fish it was it was one of these fish that i it would eat it ate a big other fish and things like that there would be sort of moby fish in a tank oh now we really get sick yeah and it i i couldn't see having fish like that i could see sort of having maybe some of the tropical fish that are really really pretty but yeah like i remember a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha uh-huh and uh you know used to drop mice in it's like this is not these aren't pets you know this is gross yeah no that would be what did they do everyone come around and watch them i mean i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house and you just destroyed the mice yep yeah well but yeah well a cat will do the same trick let's see i had a pet rat for a while and it was a live rat and um this woman just offered it to me while i was in in graduate school and she was actually a very fun pet i had a friend in college i had a friend in college who had a um had a pet rat for a while um uh-huh i forget how she got it but it was um it was the same kind of a deal i think she got it i think she was a psych major and she got it from the psych department yeah mine had been a a a how did this work a male rat had been bought and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said you know this rat is acting really strange i think he's sick and she said i don't think he's sick i think she's pregnant and they had misclassified the sex of the the uh rat there and so um she asked me if i want to one of those babies and i took the baby and i got her when she was you know just this tiniest little thing like half the size of a mouse oops uh-huh and then she grew to be you know i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand and then she grew to be pretty big you know like a pound or something i don't know how much and i had her for over two years and she was very affectionate she would you know uh-huh crawl on me and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working and things like that yeah much more than you would think uh-huh oh yeah i mean you know if you get them young and everything before they go kind of nuts so yeah rats are not my favorite animals in the world but i could see getting one from birth and everything yeah and yeah i sort of weird for me to have had one too but there it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in it's cage and you know it was easy easy to take care of and but yeah yeah i i i have friends with hamsters and gerbils and they they tell me the same thing i just again it gets into these aren't much fun you know what i guess they can be i uh-huh actually it was more fun than you would think yeah starting from the beginning but um yeah we live also live in the city now actually in Manhattan and so it's okay almost impossible it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here or certainly certainly not a dog i mean people do right oh people but it just not i don't oh plus i mean their's a pooper scooper on New York so yeah oh yeah you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny i was living in northern Jersey when that law came through remember hearing all about it we were wondering if they uh they had any special law for the horses in Central Park of course not uh-huh right no they don't actually they do they have um the bags behind them but i think they're actually supposed to they keep them yeah keep them clean but oh gosh i can't even walk by Central Park hit the bags yeah when summertime just the smell is so bad oh God i can't of the horses haven't been up there last time i was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad oh well it's not that long ago it was pretty recent not this past fall but i mean fall a few years i mean it was it was in the oh twelve times of the year yeah it was almost like October of eighty five i think was the last time i was up up there and at Center Park um i had a friend who went to Colombia and i used to go up and visit her uh-huh yeah uh-huh um so yeah that's not too far from were we live do you have you said you had two cats are they um just what you call it are they breed cats or anything or are they just no they're just mutts yeah my wife got them from uh uh-huh um friend of hers at work and everything you know you know as kittens and it was before i mean this was before we even met um she's had them for a couple years and um you know they're really cute they're they're sisters one of them is a lot bigger than the other one uh-huh uh-huh and she pushes the other one away from the food apparently i don't know all the details but they were born around Christmas because one of them is named Tinsel and the other one is named Holly you know uh-huh they're both females both yeah both females they're both spayed or whatever it is neutered uh-huh uh-huh you know um and they're they're both declawed at least on the the front claws uh-huh  okay how do you feel about them well i keep trying to get away from them i used to use a lot of credit cards i guess for a while i would use you know a variety of the the Visa and the MasterCard and the stores but i think i i impulse buy too much with them or i buy things you know i see it on sale and i think oh it's on sale i have to get it and i really don't need it or i really haven't budgeted for it so um the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them at all what about you yeah well we have this philosophy we use it when we go off somewhere but we pay for it as soon as we come back you know as soon as we get our bills we pay it off and we only have one we tore all the rest of them up um-hum um-hum okay because i don't like credit cards for one thing you know i mean they're okay i guess if you're on a trip or something you don't have to take a whole bunch of you know cash with you but i don't like using um-hum right because i've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on chapter thirteen and stuff like that because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card you don't have to pay for it hum uh-huh that's true if if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket and sometimes you may think well i don't have the money so you use the credit card it's like fake money or something yeah yeah and it gives you a sense um a false sense of security or something it seems like because you say oh well i don't have to pay for it now but you're going to have to pay for it and it seems like yeah you think well i don't have it now but payday will come and then i'll have the money but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time yes uh-huh right are you married oh okay well i know that a lot of young people you know i it took me a long time to get it through my child's head i mean that was her goal you know uh got to have a credit card but now that she has one she's only used it one time but she wanted to establish some credit um-hum um-hum but i think it finally sunk in you know because she saw some of the other people and just like she heard them say you know well i used a credit card and my husband's sister is the world's worst at oh well i'll just use the credit cards and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit um you know and i'm i'm thinking woman wake up and smell the roses before they come and get you but right besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this right and people don't see that either yeah this thing that you thought you got on sale by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing right the only one that we we have that we kept was the Discover card um-hum and it pays you to use it i mean if you pay your bill off right away if you don't ever have to pay any interest on it because they give you a certain amount every time that you use it um-hum um-hum and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any uh interest now it's and people say well you know i'm making money by using this credit card but they don't realize that if they i mean it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest i mean you have to pay the interest not pay it right off um-hum that's going to take up what you would have made um so that's the only reason that we kept that we debated for a long time plus they don't have that um charge on it you know like yeah right they don't have one of those service charge you mean yearly fee yeah so it we decided that was it you know and i mean everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card we have we could have credit cards running out our ears oh you get that stuff in the mail all the time yes yes and then i'll i'll have just like uh department stores they'll call me up you know and i'll say look i don't want the credit card well we're just going to send it to you you know you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to they'll send me any credit card i tear it up what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still that they send you these things that look like checks i just can't see it uh-huh yeah and they say hey you know two thousand dollars you know free to you kind of thing you know all you got to do is go cash those things and you've got a short term loan i hate it i can't believe they have the nerve to do that i know it and you know what what's really bad about those though is just like young people if they don't you know we take the time to you know help my daughter she's in college uh-huh but it this is her first credit card thing well when she got her first one she was so excited it was unreal look at this they sent me this money you know so then when i explained to her look you have to pay this back and they are going to charge you interest and stuff of course she ter tore it up but a lot of parents would not take the time you know and they wouldn't even think of it or their kids may not be as close as my daughter and i are and um you know they may not even discuss it they go out and cash that check thinking that you know they've got something maybe they've won something you know somebody sent them something free and go out and spend it um-hum and um it's just unreal i mean i don't like credit cards i wish that they would come up with some other way to you know the only way you could use them is if you were like on vacation they would let you use it maybe once a year you know i mean of course i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time but um i have seen so many people and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen she got uh i can't remember what she called it it's some kind of maybe it's sure or something like that it's something it's some weird name of a credit card and she is charging out of her mind already and i'm going you just got off uh-huh that's how you got on to it to start with you know what is the matter with this person but um it seems like people just you know they just think well i can just have anything i want yeah and i just don't see it like that of course i always see pay the bills first and whatever's leftover that's what you have but um maybe a lot of people don't see it like that but i can't stand owing i mean i cannot hardly tolerate to owe something like you know i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that but um i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to pay out but that's just the way i feel about it yeah i think it's it's somewhat a um symptom of our me generation and that we think we need all these things and i think my parents always you know did without or saved up to you know buy things and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have you know like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some but you know i was just like well i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup and you don't you know do without too much and you know that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up you know it kind of like in the short amount of time you know you just have to have these things just you know have them at home have to have them at my own place and that's you know a big expenditure to start um buying all these things that you think or or have to have and actually they're kind of luxuries or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place you know going in one big swoop save up and then buy it right yeah but we're not into that we're into like have to have it all now oh yeah i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that but um i guess it's because i'm older i mean i'm not real old but i am older and um you know i didn't feel like that i didn't feel like i had to have everything i guess it was because well i had everything when i was at home but i i don't know why i didn't well we're geared to that we're like okay like i want a living room set and instead of sitting back and and going okay well it's going to cost maybe a thousand dollars two thousand dollars and i'll save for two years people go oh well i'll just go buy it put it on credit and i'll pay it off um-hum yeah people aren't tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it they just put it on a charge card put it on account and then pay off the bill because they want it now it's always have to have it now hm yeah um well it didn't hurt you did it to i mean you didn't go out and charge a whole bunch and lose everything did you no no but i have had some times when i've had some pretty good balances on there and uh you know i finally you know paid them all off and thought this is you know kind of nonsense so we don't uh have big balances on them at all now we're we're you know we i use it occasionally but i pay it right off we're yeah well you learned then right yeah you learn the you know the hard way you hate paying all that interest and i've never been one to itemize on my income tax and never had enough to itemize and so it's just a big chunk of money and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying so much more for that item because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what forty dollars sometimes just to have the card yeah that's a lot of money that you went to buy this item um-hum so then and then you never feel like you've got anything to to put into savings or anything you're always just paying bills paying bills you know you don't feel that you have any extra to save and i hate i hate living paycheck to paycheck i like to have a little there you know that i can save so i can feel that you know if something comes up i've got the money to pay for it right  how did you all get tied up with this uh TI system oh did you already dial one yeah i just dial one we're being recorded already yeah okay uh we're supposed to be discussing our homes yeah but what what uh what did you uh are you with TIer or how did you get tied up with this oh it's a uh long story but uh let's discuss about our homes um what kind of home do you live in uh i guess a typical home here is without a uh uh basement i guess that's the classical uh raised style yeah uh we have something here we have something here you may not have up there which is a well we we were phasing them out is the wood shingle roof i don't know if you had it when i first got here uh-huh my parents live huh where did you got get there from from New Jersey all right uh i new you didn't have a Texas accent right no i i'm my accent's gone i've practiced a long time to get rid of it uh uh-huh uh-huh the the wood shingle roofs are phasing out here they're very they're good for air-conditioning you know they they i hear you it's you it's very shocking when you look inside the attic and on a dry day and see a hundred little or thousands of little light wholes you know i would imagine so it it's very strange and then when of course when it rains then it then it then it stretches uh-huh and does a pretty good job but uh the the fire hazard has is uh-huh uh-huh i would imagine phasing that kind of construction out it it's so so what kind of home do you live in oh it's a rent it's a multistorey uh last year uh luckily oh a colonial style two story no colonial is not the word had they use here uh that's multistorey is what they call them a multilevel it's called multilevel okay it it it's not it's not really that typical it's a custom home uh-huh uh i live in Arlington actually this i'm working tonight actually in Dallas uh uh-huh uh-huh at TI here oh you work at TI oh yeah so that's how you got hooked up to this oh yeah you know you know you can converse with the person for a while and get to know them before you punch the one you don't have to get started on the conversation right away oh yeah your right your right well anyway um well uh how many calls have you made uh have you oh i don't know several eleven twelve thirteen i guess oh really everyone everyone's higher than i am well i haven't made the calls mostly i've just uh i answered them i live in a two story type colonial here in Maryland yeah that that i heard i know those words from the east when i was there but that they don't use that word here yeah well most the homes here are two story because uh they stack them up since the property is so expensive at least in the Maryland area where i am do you have a basement yeah oh yeah that's typical up there to you know yeah well like i say the land here and depending on where you are and how crowded it is the land bays go up and here a little old measly quarter of an acre goes from anywhere from four to five thousand to a hundred and some odd thousand depending on where it is oh yeah no the land is much cheaper here and if you're in a fairly decent subdivision which i guess maybe i'm in a fairly middle-class subdivision then the general trend is to put as much house as you can on a quarter acre it took me a long time to get used to it coming from down south up here big big houses on little bitty postage stamp lots yeah but uh that's the general way they uh they build them here so you get about a twenty two hundred to three thousand square foot home depending on whether you include the basement or not yeah uh on about a quarter of an acre or less about ten thousand square feet yeah the lots aren't very big here either in the Dallas uh Fort Worth area uh-huh uh-huh uh but the basement there just aren't any basements i don't know of anyone ever even thought of putting a basement in here huh well they use slab foundations or do they use block foundations or the little uh it used to be a pier and beam where they would drill piers and and the first you would have a crawl space underneath your house but that's phased out in the last twenty five years where it's all slab crawl space okay slabs are easier and quicker to pour and lay i guess yeah and uh they they say that the the reason they don't put pier i think it's cheaper like you say but uh the soil does move a lot here and they say that you just couldn't uh uh uh-huh put a basement in the soil but i'd think they just to me i don't know really know why it wouldn't work i think you can put a basement in anywhere it's just not not popular i see what to dig out for it yeah really do you have high water tables no no it's not very high some of the water here so it's just a matter they just don't do it yeah this is Dallas there the water's down two thousand feet uh-huh well of course down there you probably don't have land as quite as much a premium so you can sprawl a big rancher out yeah i guess it's the style i really don't have an answer here because of the tornado i always thought tornados uh i thought people would build a lot of storm cellars you know or shelters you know but even that is not uh popular at all i don't know i don't know of anyone doing that uh yeah yeah uh-huh uh i don't even see it in the newspaper where people advertise that they have storm cellars or anything they just don't have them period uh-huh i understand well uh you say you live in a ranch style house yourself yeah it's it's multilevel yeah like my garage i have uh uh a bedroom over well now is it like a split level split level yeah in other words you've got some bedrooms above say a garage area and then the living room dining room area is halfway between both you go down steps to your garage and maybe a family room down there and you go up the steps to your bedroom right right exactly right right right okay that's what they call a split level up here and a split foyer is where all the steps are at the entrance way if you know what i mean yeah yeah that's a split foyer type and then uh a colonial is where they stack it on top of each other and you pretty well have most of your living space on the first floor like uh a family room or uh you know something like that and the dining room area and a living room and maybe a a kitchen with a possible little eat in area or somethi ng like that what's your typical heating up there in Maryland gas or well uh you i've been through two or three different things of them first house i came up here had gas heat with electric stove then the second house i owned had gas heat and gas stove and uh uh-huh um even gas water heater whereas my previous home it had electric water heater anyway and then the house i'm in now is all yeah uh electric it even has a heat pump oh really yeah and uh well heat pumps nice up there it would probably work pretty well well heat pumps do work pretty well up here it's taking them a few years to get the bugs out of them but uh yeah that's true they they finally seem to work quite well and i would imagine down where you all live heat pumps will work quite well or maybe down there all you need is just air-conditioning that's all well they should yeah because it's warmer in the winter or you have less of a winter down here of course it's a short winter but it does get down to five degrees uh occasionally uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but uh i don't really know if heat pumps are that popular yet i guess uh i don't i haven't been that close to it in the newer homes well i would imagine all you need is just air-conditioning yeah we we have heat uh some have air-conditioning units i i i have an all electric house but uh it's fifty fifty there's a lot of gas houses here uh because it's so popular uh-huh oh that's right you're you're in the oil state so i would imagine there's plenty of gas around so that's the way to go for heat oh yeah people i think probably prefer natural gas for for heating yeah uh-huh i would too because me i like gas heat i love it i don't i'm an engineer and i don't like the danger of it i've seen too many houses here blowup and i think yeah and i just think oh really when i had i had uh a gas uh uh fireplace you know i had and i saw the way it was constructed yeah it went over my daughter's bedrooms you know over the garage i thought and there's there's just too many fittings in this thing to leak and so i just disconnected i never did hook that sucker up so i just took it out completely uh-huh gas logs uh-huh uh-huh although people love gas here but i i'm ultraconservative on safety and i just don't don't want it uh um-hum uh-huh well i don't mind electric heating and and the like it's okay i mean i i like gas heat because it's so nice and warm but when it comes to cooking i cook i just absolute think a gas stove's the best that money can buy yeah well i've heard people you just can't beat cooking on gas yeah i've heard people say that i and i that flame man is hard to beat because you can regulate it and i mean you you want to turn the flame down on the stove you turn it down right now you don't have to wait for a cool down time which you have to rely on with uh conventional stove or or a warm-up time i mean it's instantly there yeah yeah right and that kind of response is quite uh quite effective i think for cooking oh yeah no i i've i've known people love it for years and uh but uh we've done without it for twenty years here and and uh uh-huh yeah well i've done without it too but i sure prefer it my wife does too yeah yeah no i i haven't i haven't really noticed uh i don't miss it you know with our of course i'm against i'm just i'm one of the yeah uh-huh a million people that uh is against uh gas well do your houses down there have porches or are they just pretty much like just a front door and that's it no no there's not much in front there's no sitting out front you know there's no like like in the east when i was young uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh of course it goes way back we used to sit out front i had a porch up front but no there's not a porch yeah aren't they nice yeah yeah oh yeah they're sort of coming back up here in the east i i i wish i had that you know front porches are they're not very big but they're kind of coming back right i i think the old ways in a lot of uh ways should come back uh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but i really love a screened in porch outback man i just eat that up but no the yeah no that there it's not popular here either screens in screen in is not that that's so that's uh huh well don't you all have mosquitoes down there not like not like you have up there no really it's too dry it's so dry that it's uh that's surprising Dallas is super dry hm how far are you guys from the coast down there where uh uh what is it uh uh three hundred miles yeah oh are you that's a pretty good piece then yeah i didn't know you were that far inland i knew it was a ways but our our weather is like we have a we have a the warm raining season is now is April uh-huh uh-huh and a little bit of May an then it goes into super dry all summer then you summer with a hurricane season but uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh well tell me uh do your homes down there pretty much have garage disposals and things like that yeah yeah they have everything they do are y'all on septic or y'all have public sewage no public there's essentially no septic not in Dallas Fort Worth though you have it in the out lying areas but uh uh-huh oh they use one and two car garages or just one car garages or carports two two no not carports uh it's essentially garages okay so they do go garage because i lived down south for a long time carports were real popular in certain areas where i yeah not Dallas uh Fort Worth is you know the two car garage and certainly all air-conditioned uh used to live uh-huh uh-huh uh uh two thousand square feet is probably i don't know if that's average or not about how much floor space yeah that sounds about average i think all over the country yeah uh i i think so too there's a lot of swimming pools here i don't have one uh yeah oh really i don't either i hate to clean the rascals i had a i had a pool outback behind my previous house one of those  well um so um have do you have a son or daughter that's looking for a college uh been through it ah i'm still in it okay no we've uh we've had two children graduate so and i have worked at universities uh-huh so it was a topic that uh seemed appropriate as far as discussion like this right you had you're in the process of planning for or your children are there no i'm i'm i'm i'm still in college i'm still a student oh okay okay all right i'm graduating this May yeah this May well good where are you uh North Carolina State University very good uh uh the uh planning for college tuition and all the associated costs is a tough tough decision at yeah yeah i think it's it's when you're looking for a college that you want to go i think you really should know exactly what you want to be so you can pick the best quality how did you choose North Carolina State i chose it basically that way uh North Carolina State has a reputation for being uh good agricultural school um-hum it's a land grant university right in the area exactly and um they have a good extension service for agriculture and uh i wanted to go into agriculture so i came here yeah and since since i was in you know in-state i pay resident i pay resident tuition so it was also a it was also good for me because you know being a good school plus in-state tuition saved me a lot of money the oh yes it certainly does and familiarity with the area there's sometimes advantages to moving way off and going to a unknown area but uh there's as many right well for example yeah yeah i i think that's very true because for example uh i'm going to graduate school after i finish here and uh i'm going to go to California to stay in the same area yeah uh two reasons for that i think if they even recommend in advanced degrees to uh try a different set of teachers get a different perspective as far as the the advanced degrees they'd like for you to change rather than stay in the same institution that's true yeah yeah i mean they would like for you to stay so that you know they they could keep getting your money but one you know an employer likes to see different schools i think right um-hum and i and i think a very good advisor would uh tell you that it's best for you anyway to get a different uh different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too California may have a different type of emphasis now agriculture changes by region as far as it's emphasis is concerned middle of the country would be wheat land here it's tobacco and uh California it may be right uh more of the grapes and and uh other types of right they have in California they have a lot of heavy metal problems also and a lot of salts because of the valleys very very salty oh yes right that's what i i was interested when i went over there i i uh talked to some people in the university i think also you know um dialogue between university professors helps a lot in decisions because i think that's what really turned me towards that you know the the school that i'm going to is i went and talked to the people in the school and they gave me information which i could not have gotten otherwise and that that really finalized my decision um-hum yeah what is your specialty well i'm graduating with just a soil science degree here in North Carolina but i hopefully will go to California to receive a PhD in uh soil science with a specialization in environmental environmental quality uh-huh which will deal with uh eco-toxicology heavy metals and soils and things like that so away from the production agriculture end of it and more into the soils and you know contaminants um-hum um-hum so i'm kind of branching off into a pretty specific region which i think is going to be a hot topic in the future with you know all these lands and and things that are being spoiled no question and how to how to remediate them and all no question you i'm sure you you and your classmates have been following the uh waste situation in North Carolina and the the absence or facility to handle right especially in the sounds right and it's it's a universal problem you know if you look at uh some countries you expect them to have problems Latin America now with cholera and and a bunch of other problems associated with um-hum waste management the United States you can expect more out of but we still have the same very deep problem of how to take care of our waste we create a bunch now now what do we do with it yeah now that now that it's getting harder to get permits for landfills uh the the problem's pressing down harder than ever yeah and then i think there's a a big mistrust public mistrust as there is with nuclear energy uh they were talking about Chernobyl again this this week because it's an anniversary but i think there's a big mistrust of uh some of the waste management companies in terms of how well they do take care of their product and that's got to be solved i think there has to be public trust in it before you can yes uh i agree with you find a good sight well i wish you luck in California yeah uh thanks a lot it was nice talking to you all right bye okay same here bye  so the general topic is hobbies let's hear about your hobbies yes well let's see what kind of hobbies do i have i guess uh i it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing i enjoy playing basketball and and basically all kinds of sports and uh excuse me any handicrafts any handicrafts no not not really um no i i'm really not too creative well i uh you know around with my hands and things like that i leave that more up to my mom so i i think i'm developing a new handicraft i think it'll become resume writing oh yeah oh well let's hope that you you you aren't employed employed by that craft for too long uh yeah i i hate to think about it and and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads yeah it it uh-huh what what what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there i who knows is it uh basically i had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it Texas no all means about fifteen to twenty percent of oh wow of oh i'm sure the numbers somewhat classified but it's on the internal news and the news services so it's approximately six fifty so uh-huh ten percent of six fifty sixty five and twenty percent would be one thirty wow how about that yeah that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to McKinney yeah that's possible how about that well that's uh that's unfortunate is there many many other are you in the defense oh yes that's here is it uh it many other corporations in the area uh i saw 7-Eleven that was hiring well i'm sure with the new uh awarding contract awarding i i think it went to Lockheed didn't it yes that uh i hear they're hiring all over the place for that yeah uh no Apple's coming to town and and that has some opportunities and uh and oh really now is that actually just to Colorado or to Colorado Springs Colorado Springs specifically yes how about that and uh and uh MCI's coming if if telemarketing is your bag personally i'd rather die a slow painful death but um-hum were you in the uh computer operations or in the actual uh manufacturing uh i'm a defense worker a government tool control specialist right yeah that's why i was in the DSEG down here in Plano also are you still employed am i still employed by TI no i took a leave of of TI back in November oh actually December was my first month away from them exempt or hourly oh yes exempt it uh uh fortunately i guess for myself it wasn't uh it was purely by my own choice it wasn't uh there was no incentive for myself to leave but it was just an opportunity arose and decided to take it oh so you didn't even get the severance package no i should have taken the the the you know uh option when that was there but it was just i missed it by a couple months but you know what can one do i'm just happy to still to have a job so are you happy with what you're doing now yeah i am kind of happy with it it it's getting better all the time i knew it would be different from the very beginning but you know as as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system so i was in the computer operations it's uh you know it all starts to become similar there's you know there's benefits and there's things that weren't as good but as an overall package i'd say i i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out yeah good good well hasn't been a long time TI or i i'm um-hum significantly shaken by the situation right but not devastated um-hum well the the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the the fact that that that is more in the support of the manufacturing and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe maybe not in the defense the defense area but manufacturing in general tell you the truth i'm i'm i'm not really worried uh-huh well that's great that's good and and i seem rather happy about it most of the time just just to know uh-huh what's possibilities are you know what might happen sure yeah sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table but still in all it may be a blessing in disguise it feels funny i know a number of people who are uh surplused and they're just actually what the positions that they've found outside of the company were much much better than the ones that they currently had inside so despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or or going for walks in the mountains i can't seem to get into it right now exactly uh-huh well i'm sure it's just with the the the the way that things are so topsy-turvy right now as soon as you decide decide on a pass uh situational i i doubt i'll be here in six months uh-huh well would you like to be there i all things being equal yes uh-huh what but or or even somewhere better but sure God this is much better than west Texas uh-huh well just take the day but then they they tell me hell is much better than west Texas well actually uh the the the Plano Dallas Houston you know Austin that whole area is is actually quite quite nice i my little brother lives in Austin right now oh that's a beautiful place goes to UT uh-huh that's just fantastic down there take it more as a this is your opportunity to do whatever you want pick out where you want to live and then once you pick that spot out pick out what you want to do i see that's the problem for the last many years i've more or less let them direct what i want to do and where i want to go um-hum um-hum and just kind of go with the punches sure and now i feel lost um-hum yeah that's a it it takes a bit of a shift doesn't it oh i've had job offers uh-huh but i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave uh-huh well the best thing about it is that you can uh try something if you don't like it shoot move on to something else that's the way i've uh looked at the whole thing here i'll take a chance if i don't like it i'll go someplace else do something different and that oh so had you been with TI long when you changed five years well there's a noticeable difference there i've been with them sixteen yeah yeah i can imagine you know the longer and longer it goes actually seventeen now and oh yeah momentum is uh driving force in our lives um-hum but so yeah i'm looking as as a opportunity well that's good you've got a good attitude about it and and i'm looking at it as a change um-hum and i'm looking at it as as an adventure right there you go that's the way to do it and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then there you go that's the thing to do that's much funner than doing any kind of job huh how about we end this that'll work out just fine nice talking to you all right nice talking to you good-bye bye  dining out seems to be a uh uh something we do off and on through our lives i guess as economics and as kids come and go and uh situations change uh we used to do right um-hum quite a bit of dining out before the children and then as they came along and uh additional expenses sitting came into every dinner out um that that halted a lot of it as well as just the the uh oh i guess the lifestyle changes a little bit slows down a little bit and right now even the atmosphere that that we would seek uh when we go out is often more quiet and uh um-hum a little bit more uh subdued uh not smoke filled or or bar uh dance floor type yeah so yeah funny how that happens after kids right that uh those type of qualities have uh moved into the picture and then there's there's some economic concern but usually it's if if it's going to be a night out it's going to be a a decent meal and and uh fortunately for us there's not a whole lot of places in the immediate area that's totally really expensive you have to go a ways to get to a really um-hum high dollar uh hundred and fifty dollar dinner type deal which they're forty to fifty miles away and they're they're all around but they're just a ways so we can do a good um yeah yes twenty twenty five dollar night out and have a decent steak and it comes out okay right uh we look for i guess uh service uh you know i'm not i'm not in eating at McDonald's long enough the fastest the speed of it doesn't bother me you know i'm not looking for fast food at that night so the fact that it took them twenty thirty minutes to get it there that's that's okay i'm that's twenty minutes away from the kids or however long you know you're out for the evening or it doesn't really matter that they not get it there right away but um right that's right right have a little chime little hard time finding a place that'll cook the steak just right i have to remember how to ask for it for this given restaurant to get it just the way i like it without too much pink in there and uh get it cooked good i imagine uh in in Texas there would be uh a lot of steak restaurants is that right yeah there seem to be quite a few quite a few yes um-hum and now on this area of course here in Maryland you're close to the Chesapeake there seems to there is some there are some steak restaurants but they lean more towards seafood here um-hum steak and lobster type uh you probably have seafood a lot also yeah they do oddly enough even being near near the gulf uh they tend to advertise the the main the whole east coast uh seafood for some reason it tends to be a draw i don't know particularly why i mean to me it tastes pretty much the same once you do to it whatever you're going to do to it you know like oh is that right right well do you have crabs and lobster in that area that's yeah yeah yeah crab and lobster and and uh yeah that's that's hum that's funny that they would yeah they withdraw from that i guess you know you can ship stuff anywhere pretty much and uh right right right and you probably have crawfish would you have crawfish uh probably i'm not a big fan of that so i wouldn't wouldn't be paying much attention to it um yeah yeah well a lot of what you said uh sounds similar to us i remember that uh before before we had children we have two boys that are like nine and six and actually the oldest one is just starting to learn to behave in a restaurant so before we had kids we would definitely dine out more frequently probably several times a week and it didn't have to be necessarily anything fancy but it was more uh a matter of before children say we were both working we didn't feel like cooking we just went out and now you know as you said once you've children that's not always an option uh i worked off and on um you know because they were little and and and also you know once you're home and you have them um places that you went before spur of the moment that might be nice but casual um sometimes it's not worth it to go through the trouble of digging the sitters and everything just to go and so what i have found now that um right when we do go out uh as you said you out on the town now when we go out it's it's you want it to be more special um-hum you don't want to just uh necessarily run out for you know a one hour and come back i noticed with us it's more when we do go out then we do try to make it something nice maybe a dinner theater or nice restaurant with friends um sometimes lunches when we can do that that's okay too but um it definitely you know it definitely changes is changed we maybe eat in somewhat nicer places now but that's because when we do go right there's so there's like a special quality to that because it is a few hours away from the kids right and um but not as often we don't do it as often um and what i'm finding now is they're finally getting to the age where we're venturing into going again with them and of course when you take them though you're going to go to something like a McDonald's level or maybe a little bit of a family style restaurant uh-huh uh but in this area there there are quite a few decent restaurants that are not too expensive and uh i i i tend to agree with you too we look for more um uh quiet type more of a subdued atmosphere now and i think part of that is after you have kids you're you're not as interested in going to uh Georgetown type places where you know you go in every place and there's a lot of uh noise right yelling and uh you know you look for different things and that crowd seems to change and you know you're not as much part of it um and you don't there are more decent restaurants moving out to the suburbs you know and that type of thing uh you don't necessarily have to go downtown DC to to find decent restaurants and uh there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area there's a uh one place that really not sure if the marketing concept is is carried throughout it's chain but in this particular town um i live about two suburbs north of Dallas actually and in this particular town we're about two miles from this uh um-hum this steak house that has a oh i don't know a motif to the entire uh shopping center it's the anchor for this entire strip shopping center i guess and they'll the entire place is uh-huh um has covered walkways all around to all the little shops that are they're not they're not even individual shops in some cases some cases are just kind of you they they put it all out in a little store shed out on to an area and then they put it all away at night um then there are there's one two whole rows actually of um-hum of just what we would call a stall of flat concrete place with little posts and they're all marked off with little lines and so if you want to rent this little spot though the farmers bring their stuff down and have a farmers market type oh i see so we went to this steak house once uh well several times but the most particular time that we were away from the kids and and had a a good length of time and it was on a Friday night and we knew the place would be really busy but we we got there about uh six or six thirty and put our names on the list of of the waiting list and then we walked around the uh the place that has there were still some farmers there at the time there was a lot of hand uh craft type stuff being sold uh there was a blacksmith and he's showing off his little traits and things that he could sell as well as uh yeah that's nice uh the hallways between the places that were of of business the hallways were decorated with uh old pictures and history of the of the town as it were um-hum we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then wow uh came back out and walked around a little bit more and went home so it it's quite an interesting uh deal they don't even take reservations because they're so booked like that that uh wow jeez well if i'm here also there's been such a growth in in housing uh not in the last year but before that it was just i don't know if you've been in this area in the last few years but it's just been incredible and and has it's gone crazy i mean where we are was basically a farm ten years ago and it's houses are stacked and what has happened really is that um some of the commercial um uh places have not caught up with the population here and so we do have a problem of the the half decent restaurants when you go on a Friday or Saturday night you're looking for quite a long wait hum and um not all of them do take reservations either so so you sometimes have to allot yourself uh enough time um you know to go out uh you can't figure on going out and being back in two hours you know um the other thing that's changing here is because of the um the age set here uh a lot mostly people in they're i'd say late twenties to early forties in these neighborhoods that uh we haven't done it because i don't think it will work well with us having two boys but um some of the more expensive restaurants now i understand are catering um to children and making half price menus for them whereas before um they would be totally discouraged from bringing children in and they're doing this basically because they're so many working parents in this area and that they were losing the business because once all these younger people were having children they weren't going to the restaurants right  okay i guess i'll start um one uh big thing that the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their let their child experience college in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there and i feel like that now if i went if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldn't have have gotten as much exposure to different people and different uh i don't know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students that's interesting i went to a smaller school of probably three thousand thirty five hundred and i i i thought that was the best experience in that um-hum uh-huh um-hum we had more one-on-one since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and hum and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um hm um-hum one of fifty thousand i was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives i uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing right um-hum yeah yeah yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller um because like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number yeah but um i i just i don't know i'm thinking in a sense of uh just being exposed to more it just seems like in a larger college you i don't know you're exposed to so many more people from all over the world and i'm sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that they're more of of the different cultures there not that it not that it's better but i'm just saying that i think that big uh-huh yeah that's one thing to definitely consider uh-huh uh-huh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um they or they're considering going to Baylor they're also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just Waco like i live in Waco it's a large city i can still function in my own kind of area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and i'm really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big uh-huh a big university you're not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that yeah i think that's probably key to me is not so much the size of the school but what what are the particular needs of um-hum the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school um-hum would not have been comfortable with that they needed uh at at least at first um-hum um-hum right they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get one-on-one from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to right um-hum a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more self-confidence built up oh yes i can do this oh i've done this before it's just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me um-hum um-hum right the key would be what what are what are the child's the the student's needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education you you you can expect um-hum um-hum all of them with uh uh uh accreditation accreditation to give the education but it's these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but they're the things that don't show up in uh-huh on paper um-hum exactly that's that's one important thing that i think about school i'm i'm not a kind a person that i didn't i i was kind of a B student i guess you'd say and i didn't really that's right that's right i was i strived strived to be an A student but it wasn't like a real priority to my my priority was just right being as worldly as i could possibly be getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have more friends um because you like you said you know you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school yeah um you know you just you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college you may have gone to school with them but you wouldn't you wouldn't know them uh um-hum yeah i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college i guess i guess now i've been out for i i'm i'm older than you i've been out for twenty one years and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had sparked it sparked a question and i went to a uh um-hum um-hum small private school um and it was church related and i got to looking at my class of sixty nine um-hum um-hum um-hum and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same wow um-hum memories if not the same education education in you know we we weren't all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didn't have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later um-hum right wow that's great and it's it's it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things um-hum those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI right right i have something more important to me than that that's great that's great yeah that's what i that's basically what i and when i first i've been out of college only two years now so it's still pretty fresh on my memory um uh-huh but now that i'm out when i went into school my parents told well my father okay let me let me go back to my my sister now is is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that uh-huh would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards uh-huh just kind of U UT or a larger school and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and i wanted her to get the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because she's a straight A student which is yeah yeah yeah so she you know that's probably uh-huh i was going to ask who won you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her right right and that that's another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what they're going to do yeah i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to uh what's now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school um-hum right and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money and and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it hum right um-hum and because i knew all along that's what i wanted even even though i had to buck the family in order to to do what i needed to do um-hum right well that was pretty courageous so um i i guess i guess it was it was my mother's support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans after i got out yeah oh yeah yeah i i'm i'm dealing with the loans right now so so oh yes very every every month that memory just shoots back in my mailbox sounds familiar huh your it's very fresh in your memory well uh yeah yes well sorry about that Tanya so oh well i guess i'll get over it but oh yeah yeah okay i'm sure it was worth it though if if nothing else because i work in training at TI now if nothing else just uh-huh those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the self-esteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on um-hum um-hum and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted right because when you when you do want when you do finally graduate that that's what you need the most i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper it's stamina courage uh words it young lady you have gotten your education then that's that's right yes i'm needing you know myself i'm needing to rely on myself and i think i learned a lot of that in school too yeah  so well this is an appropriate topic the day after Earth Day i thought right um um well what do you think is uh the pollutants the main pollutants in the air i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that i just uh i think they put off so much and they're not regulated enough yeah that's me too after um on channel thirteen uh they had some some programs the day before and i'm not sure that about yesterday we didn't really watch it too much yesterday but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and you know how we're affecting the Earth and things by what we do as the people and and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot and that actually um uh-huh yeah as our population increases and you know our of course our our cars you know our number of cars increase per the population that's the problem but also like you said the industry pollution and you know they're regulation they're regulation that's placed on them is i mean it's better than it used to be but it's incredible that they still don't have you know they don't they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air right you know i i just i can't stand that and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that you know they're supposed to be regulated because we have a we have a plant i don't know about TI but we have a plant uh a Pillsbury plant uh-huh in in a town adjacent to ours and i know people that work there that of course you wouldn't think Pillsbury would put out certain chemicals no but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of the um what they do uh to uh make their dough and stuff to really clean out the flour and stuff like that yeah i mean it's incredible and um huh they said that they're you know they have a little creek that runs by them and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they you know shut down everything and they clean up their act but on a normal basis that they're that they're dumping things oh that they're not supposed to be dumping and i'm like if they're getting away with it right can you imagine that's a that's a Pillsbury plant i can't imagine plants i wouldn't have thought that Pillsbury could would the i mean or even had chemicals you know well yeah they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff you know to to break the flours down and then they they also do testing there and i don't you know when when you consider you know it's probably not radioactive but toxic can be those chemicals would not yeah can be anything that's uh classified that can damage the Earth right yeah so there could be a lot of things that they could put you know that chemicalwise that they use to uh that they are testing with right you know like in that they're dumping yeah in packaging and uh you know just goodness yeah i don't think they do the packaging at this plant but they do they do a lot of research and they do um they do do a lot of the refining up there or i'm not really what's it called when you do flour i'm not yeah yeah uh only thing i can think is bleaching but i mean i i don't know what's how they do the flour yeah yeah but but um we we're on the southwest side of Houston we don't have that much as far as uh any of the plants over on this uh the west east side does uh-huh we've got Imperial sugar but uh and they're you know they're right there on the creek also and uh they've been there for years yeah and uh but i mean you think about it it you know it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just i'm not really sure but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down strean or stream or such or you can you can you know do uh testing on the ground itself at that point yeah uh-huh but when they pollute into the air and you've got you know and you've got movement through the air it's going to move a lot of that off so i don't see you know how they can do some of the tests unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution you know like in Los Angeles or or the bigger cities where it it tends to get stuck there you know that you have a lot more particles in the air uh-huh right yeah you know per per uh per particles in the surrounding community because it's not moved away uh-huh but um i know that i worry every now and then we're still on a well water we're not on city water uh-huh and i think well what if somebody's dumped something back there in the and no one knows about it and you know it sinked in through the ground and all that yeah well i know out in some i'm not sure i can't remember the name of the county it's it's where Stillwater is or yeah Sweet no i'm not sure i know it i think it's uh i know we have a piece property there it's called Dublin it's in Dublin Texas i'm not really sure what the county it's Stephen no Stephenville uh-huh oh okay okay okay where Stephenville's at they've had a lot of problems because they've um introduced a lot of dairies there uh-huh yeah so they have a lot of cattle in the area i mean they've got like per per yard uh per lot you know they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't the the it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like right uh-huh a day produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure oh one cow i was like my God and they and this thing says that that you know if people think well cow manure is good for fertilizer but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not it's not when you know you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it and they've added humus and stuff that breaks it down and and this uh-huh and this article said that they've got a real problem that um you've got toxins and and uh bacteria in the manure that is what it's doing is it's going through uh they don't have a very deep um oh you know they're water uh-huh they're natural water uh i forget what that's called with you know it's like a spring spring water but it's below the surface it's not very far down yeah uh-huh and all this stuff is seeping through to the water and they're like they're afraid that you know within a certain amount of years oh that it's they're water they're water in that town will be totally polluted and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have um polluted it will completely polluted so that they're you know there's too many toxins and bacterial growth and i'm like my God you know uh-huh yeah and the ground right just from that one you know just from them introducing dairy farms in that one county right yeah and the the ground will fil ter some of it but not all of it no not when you figure i didn't realize a cow one cow produces that much manure and they were talking like these are well fed thousands of cows you know they were talking thousands cows in one little tiny area you these are good grief these are well fed cows uh well they are evidently but um i mean even evidently a normal cow produces that much too uh-huh but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not you know a problem right but when they get them in these tiny little areas you know and they've got a real big problem and they they said that that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff and taking it to uh these uh-huh like ponds that they had to filter it with but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years they just overflow and they overflow into the the creeks and stuff in the area yeah so that just creates you know there there's and oh it was just disgusting it said the creeks will foam people people stand outside their houses and their watch the creeks foam brown and all and i'm just like oh my gosh and the smell is really bad they say oh oh now that's bad right i was going to say the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad yeah but i i don't know it really frightens me though as far as the when you think about the you know thinking of just air pollution itself and then and channel thirteen they're really um emphasizing the problem with acid rain you know if we if we keep putting that stuff into the air and and you know if we keep creating the problem and not doing anything about it that it's really going to be a problem for um uh-huh just the the Earth you know what the Earth is receiving back you know because how can you tell where it's going to come down at yeah right right and then cutting the trees you know that bothers me yeah as far as you know the rain forest and all yes uh we've been wanting to well not me but uh it's been recommended or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here i'm like no you know you know for what's cut down here you know more will be cut down someplace else and it will just take that longer to grow back and trees help so that uh yeah i don't well they do because what is it carbon dioxide they use that where we can't synthesize it and they're synthesizing it for us uh-huh they right right believe me it's just so much better yeah so uh yeah i knew i think there's lots that be that could be done to to improve how things are done now yeah i think we just have to i don't know personally you know i suppose you know if you just make sure your car is uh-huh is working properly and you you know they're suppose nowadays they have the emission controls on them but uh i think the only the main thing is just keep on the legislators' your legislators' back you know as far as seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying okay we're really going to get involved it it's really becoming a problem by the year two thousand there will what what are we going to have what kind of results are we going to have for the environment and uh-huh right and what will we  okay now uh the town i live in uh they started a recycling program uh in the certain small part of town a little couple neighborhoods neighborhoods and they said that they were disappointed in the response that people they tried to promote it and everything but i don't think the city necessarily supported what the they were doing uh is this like roadside collection yeah i don't think they really uh encouraged it i don't think they really uh made it well-known how to do it uh that's my perception but well now down here we've got you know collection bins in the parks and things but there's no you know there's absolutely no yeah there used to be uh a big uh trash bin several trash bins in front of the Wal-Mart in town here that uh you could put plastic jugs on one side and newspapers on another and glass on the third but uh that has been taken away it's not there anymore i mean that thing was always full because people really brought stuff to it all the time and uh then they took it away for no real reason that i can understand or i ever heard about and it's not there anymore and the only place to take things to recycle them is like clear off on the other side of town and who's going to do that very few people that's right well i've seen you know i've seen examples of uh communities where they they take the other other approach you know you you have to do it or you're fined is that right and you know i'm actually all for that i don't i'm probably not the best best person for recycling but i'll be damned if you know if they they didn't uh charge me an extra ten bucks for garbage collection every month i'd be sure and recycle yeah how how how do they monitor that though i wonder i mean it's not that much trouble it's just different different communities that pass the laws that say you have to have to recycle you have to you have to you know on Mondays they pick up glass and on Tuesdays it's you know plastics or whatever and if if you don't uh if your garbage is just out there in a bag and it's not sorted you know they mark you down and fine you for it shit it's kind of like hum it's the same principal when there's a drought they fine you for using water you know they just yeah you don't do what they say and you not that i promote over government or anything but you know the the world's in a bad enough state you know i people being the way they are you kind of need some incentive yeah it would definitely help you know even if they were to uh uh pay like for recycling aluminum or uh newspapers or whatever i mean they used to be that if you well like grocery stores you buy uh pop and and you had a deposit on the bottle you bring the bottle back you get a nickel per bottle back or whatever you know that encourages you not to throw it away you'd take it back and and yeah right and get your money back or at least exchange it for another bottle that's full you know that's true um i haven't seen that done for a long time either yeah no deposit no return yeah everything's no deposit no return or else it's all plastic jugs that you just pitch you know uh i was listening to Karen DeNard the other night on the way home from school you know she's got that talk show and uh yeah KRA and they were talking about you know a lot of the plastic bottles you can't just throw all plastics together is that right and they were talking about you know you need legislation to uh identify what kind of plastic it this is what can be recycled as what hum because you know say shampoo bottles i think was the example they gave there's no they don't even give you any indication of what kind of plastic that is you just can't throw that in with your hum two liter Coke bottles or whatever i wasn't aware of that i thought they were more or less all the same yeah so did i that's that's it was news to me too i thought it was kind of interesting though there needs to be legislation that they should all be the same plastic yeah they yeah that or you know things need might be identified and there needs to be a means a convenient means for people to to recycle i know for me now i've got to drive a few miles down the road to do it if i want to do it and a lot of times it's the difference between doing it or not doing it yeah you know is whether you can like take it out the back like stick it out in the back back alley for the guys to pick up when they do or having to throw it in the back of your car or at least have you know a a bunch of collection bins around the city you know if they had one for every five thousand people or or two thousand people uh you know just scattered throughout the city you know who who wouldn't mind just you know why going down that way anyway just throw things in the back of your car and right right and take them down and throw it in there i mean i think that would be great i i'd support that entirely you know as a country we produce way too much garbage it's it's it's phenomenal yeah way too much well i know just as an individual you know i know how many times i haul out a bag of trash and it's like incredible if you multiply that times everybody oh yeah you know on my block in this city it's crazy where i work there they have uh uh recycled paper thing so you just you have two trash cans in your office one one is for the regular right non recyclable trash and is for paper yeah and you know i think it's great i use it all the time yeah you're TI right yeah so am i you know and i read that the companies now save like what fifteen thousand trees or whatever because of that and i thought that's great yeah it is you know i guess there's the other side of the issue that uh there need to be facilities for processing all this stuff and a market for recyclable goods uh yeah and that was something they brought up on the show i listened to was uh you know there's all kinds of you know recycled paper but you know nobody's wanting to use it is that right you know how many people are using how many people do you know that use recycled paper in the office yeah you know you can you can buy your your Moore's computer forms for your computer paper or whatever you can buy it with regular paper or recycled and i'll guarantee you in my building i haven't seen recycled paper yet yeah so at the same time we're we're doing all this effort to throw it a way and recycle it we ought to be working on the other end and and paying the extra dime on on a dollar for that recycled stuff i've always wondered why they haven't taken some of these recycled plastics and made them into like uh plastic boards to build a house with instead of making it out of wood lumber make it out of out of plastic boards well i think they actually do some of that but again it's the cost the cost of processing that it just is that right it intimidates people you know it's easier to buy something that's you know the the the cost of building is already once again the bottom line counts yeah for it it's easy to say but for a lot of people to do you know if you were building a house and you were going to spend you know fifty thousand versus twenty thousand on mat erials because your yeah you're going to you're going to pay for uh technology that's not mature yet yeah that that's a problem what are you going to do you know you're going to spend twenty thousand and and then right it off and yeah you mean you're going to do what you can that's right well but uh that's about all i have to say tonight i was surprised i thought this thing was shut down but i what's that i thought this whole switchboard thing was shut down i was surprised to get the call yeah so did i but i thought i'd try one more time and sure enough it's okay yeah great well thanks for talking and all right all right bye see you later bye  okay this is really ironic that this would i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away and it's just oh no been tearing me up all day because we have just been looking all over for him we've been to the pound we've been to the humane society we've been to the adoption oh i bet center we've just been all over the neighborhood we've been calling neighbors so this is just really strange that oh i guess so have you lost him before no this is the first time um he's gotten out before but he's always stayed right here you know he's never gone away and so this is just really strange you know because um uh-huh uh-huh what kind of a dog is he he's part golden lab and part uh let's see Alaskan no not Alaskan i always forget uh Australian shepherd yeah oh boy he's a big one then huh and yeah he's pretty big that's why it it really surprises me you know that he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and i would think you know he might i mean he might could get hurt by a car or something i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big you know but i don't know yeah oh well i i hope he comes back that's too bad how long have you had him thanks i do too oh about two years so he's yeah it's really gosh oh that's tough yeah you get very attached to animals don't you that isn't that funny how we do i mean we just really yes well you know they're always there for you and they don't talk back to you and uh it's kind of pleasant yeah sure sure yeah well they're companions you know they're really well do you have any pets yes we have a little a dog a little white Lhasa and her name is Angel and we have a cat who a white cat he's he's just a Tabby just a and his name is Dominique we call him Neek but um how do they get along together pretty good uh we've we had the the dog first and um she's kind of a wimp and and the cat kind of rules but uh uh she she likes him all right he we had another cat uh about two years ago it got leukemia feline leukemia so we had to have it put to sleep and uh then we got this new cat so i um i have two children and they really enjoy the animals and then my mother who is very elderly lives with us and she's really good friends with the dog they're very good buddies oh yeah that's what are so neat about animals i mean they are you know like i said they're they're really companions you know and they're friends you know i mean they that's right you can love them all you want and they love you right back and they don't yeah no i know it's just so neat you know it's that's right they don't care what you look like or what you act like they just love you unconditionally it's wonderful that's i don't know this is just so hard it's just like i said we've had him for two years and he's never i mean he's he's gotten out it's oh i know it has to be but he's always been right there he's never been gone from at all you know he's just always been right there when he gets out you know it's the first time he's ever been gone like this uh-huh uh-huh oh yeah oh that's really too bad that's awful well uh i i just knew today uh you know we looked at the pound and and that we just went all over the place and i knew we were going to find him you know and when we didn't it was like oh no so i don't know well i i'll i hope you'll find him you most likely will yeah we keep you know they they told us like at the Humane Society and the adoption center you know don't give up hope you know and then well have you put any posters up or anything like that well not yet we were talking about that tonight since you know he we just he just got out yesterday we were just talking about that whether we um-hum we were trying to find some pictures of him recently we've got so many when he was a puppy uh-huh yeah you know but we just don't have a whole lot we have him on film you know on the video camera you know but you can't put that on the you know so um-hum um-hum yeah no you sure can't oh dear so i don't know i we will probably will put some things up some posters and stuff up well that's good and hopefully that will help you know and maybe around the neighborhood but we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood so that helps too you know if they can keep yeah they can keep their eyes open yeah that will help well so i think that if somebody else picks him up i think that uh if he gets out he'll come back you know i really do because he knows exactly where he lives so yeah yeah yeah he will i bet he does i know that it's hard on you i know that i'd be worried too nope i know it's just like i said it's just so ironic that this would happen you know and i would get this this kind of a call yeah it just i know it's really strange but yeah isn't it though that is that's yeah i know sometimes our cat will will stay out all night and when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him that somebody he's got in a fight or you know somebody's hit him and and uh and if he doesn't come by mid morning then i really get scared but he's always come back eventually so well that's good that's one thing about cats though they're so small and you know they can get hurt a lot easier you know and then so that would make you really tend to worry about them you know if they're not right there yeah yeah they can yeah yeah well but he's a real feisty guy he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property it's is that right he's cats are really almost more territorial than than dogs are they just really do not want other animals on their property they're very very he he just any cat that comes near and even a dog he won't he won't jump at them or anything but he'll sit and he'll watch and it and he i think maybe he would if it came real close but he's very protective of our property huh that's really i i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them so i never had them growing up so you know i never really had them around me you know so i've never owned one you know but so uh-huh yeah well they're uh really a lot different than dogs because they're not they're very independent and uh they're very he's he's very affectionate when he wants to be but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be he'll just he'll you know either scratch you or or run away um but when he wants to be huh uh he's really affectionate he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and and and snuggle up to you and but if he's not in the mood you'd better stay away from him so but dogs seem to be always in the mood they're always you know right there and like like you to pet them and loving and so huh yeah that's true i i like the way they come up and they'll they'll put their head underneath your hand you know it's that uh and most dogs do that i mean i don't know any that really don't i mean you know they know exactly how to get that attention you know they just yeah yeah oh yeah they do hm they sure do you know come up and they put your you know or they'll rub their their head against you you know and it's it's yeah is now do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outside well no well well he's outside during the day and then when we get home at night we do bring him in and you have a fenced yard or uh-huh yeah uh-huh yeah the backyard it's real big too for him to run in and stuff that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out you know because he got all this room to run in and yeah well how did he get out but he dug a hole under the fence well see he did he did it a couple weeks ago dug a hole and you know we we filled it back up oh boy um-hum put him back in there he did it again so we chained him up you know but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because you know we feel like that's just too restricting for him so um um-hum um-hum right right we got we we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it you know so that he couldn't get out well he kind of ripped through the chicken wire so i can't i i i just have not um-hum oh i don't understand you know because it's like uh he's got a good home you know he's got i mean we have two kids you know that just love him a lot you know it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out you know we just couldn't yeah yeah well you know that animals are like that they like to roam and investigate and yeah i guess that's yeah i guess that's probably true i don't think it's anything we did least i would hope not no i i know i mean he's always you know he really does have a good home i think that's what really and see what's going on no no i'm sure that yeah bothers me the most about it you know it's like yeah how are your kids handling it well i don't know if it's really quite hit him hit them uh i have two girls and they they just been real um uh-huh uh-huh i don't know at first you know they seemed to be upset but now it's like um well if he doesn't come home can we get another dog it's like wait a minute you know yeah yes that sounds like kids uh-huh oh poor Buddy you know i said he's only been gone a day and you already want to replace him Buddy um-hum what's his name did you call Buddy we that's what's our cat's name that that that died oh yeah we named him uh uh we named him Buddy after uh Buddy Bell uh uh is that right the Ranger baseball player that used to be here and we used to we were really into that when we got him oh going to the Ranger games and we named him Buddy Beaner for some reason but Buddy after Buddy Bell so but he was he was a good cat too we miss him a lot and i feel feel i feel real guilty because that's funny yeah it just we had him like for six years and one year i forgot to get his leukemia booster and he got it oh and i just felt so bad i it's real contagious and it's and the vet said it runs rampant in this area and if they don't have their booster i didn't know that any kind of saliva or anything from another cat if they get in a fight it automatically like they get it if the other cat has it so i had no i had no idea i did not know that oh oh it was terrible i just felt terrible and i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was he was just real getting real skinny  okay Jerry uh could you tell me what what type of a house you have well at the moment i have a little vacation house back in the woods and it's brick and it has it's pine paneled uh and it's a vacation home well kind of because it's temporary oh i see okay and it but if you know if you want to talk about other kinds of homes my husband uh son is a builder in Oklahoma City and he was visiting a couple of weeks ago so we went around to see all uh the homes that how they build homes in Charlotte okay so are you new to are you're new to Charlotte what kind of materials they use kind of originally from this area uh from Virginia uh area but yeah oh okay uh but moved here from Oklahoma City originally from Oklahoma City well no but we spent twenty years in Oklahoma we're a mobile society wow twenty years is a long time yes it is to love it um so yours is your home right now is typical of the ones that are in the area well in the immediate area because we're in the county with the uh uh farmers kind of farmers they're about you know around ninety already eighty nine or ninety but their children have grown up and they have built then more contemporary are more uh uh kind some ostentatious homes huh okay uh but all traditional they're they're uh they're some are contemporary contemporary but mostly traditional yeah yeah oh how about your home um are you interested in uh it's uh it's a salt box that's a it's a it's a New England oh gosh type uh i was born and brought up in the area that that i lived in and it was very rural and there was nothing there but uh uh farms uh-huh uh or orchards one or the other you know there was a lot of apple orchards so when we decided to build we built uh-huh about thirteen years ago uh we looked for a home and the things that we were seeing were uh not up to my standards they were still building homes back then like they have for a hundred and fifty years you know the very little insulation in the walls and very little insulation in the ceiling so yes um-hum that doesn't work these days yeah and it was uh it wasn't what we wanted so we did some research and i knew the land there's a lot of ledge up here so you have to be careful um-hum uh their septic systems when there's no uh uh public sewer system there is water however so we picked out a piece of land that we liked and bought it and then we decided to build so we we did a lot of research like i said and we and we built a typical New England salt box in the area and when we built we were the first home there there was like about ten acres of oak forest around us oh my and it was absolutely gorgeous uh since then however they've torn it all down and we're surrounded by homes you know that's a that's another long story yes yes but we're the only typical New England home in the area there's a lot of there's an English Tudor right next to us and there's uh there's a colonial our street's on just a short street there's only like six homes on it uh-huh and there's a uh an English colonial down on the corner and the rest are raised ranches and you know the typical uh home yes but we built ours um we made uh we did it ourselves uh i sent uh uh some rough plans out to an architect to have him draw it up and then i subbed out the things that i couldn't do like i had a crew come in and frame it and i did the rest i did the inside the wiring the plumbing and uh you know um-hum sure my goodness so we built the walls huh you are multitalented you are multitalented uh my dad had built a couple when we were growing up so kind of got used to it and we did a lot of research uh-huh sure sure well if you were to do it uh again today what would you have done differently name things say uh we made the kitchen a working kitchen i think i would've made the kitchen uh a lot bigger because both of us like to cook uh-huh uh-huh and right now a working kitchen is very efficient but two people kind of get in each other's way yeah it's similar to a galley kitchen yeah and then we have uh a like a little dining area off that we have a formal dining room is that like a galley kitchen uh-huh uh-huh um i've since added onto the house we've got like uh uh looks like an old rustic uh log cabin on the inside uh it's all natural wood the ceiling's pine the walls are pine you know it's uh one of those type kick around rooms um-hum um-hum and we put a greenhouse on it it was uh designed to be heated by the sun yes how does that work in the winter um it works fine as long as you don't put any plants in it exactly it burns it up i'm a plant uh former plant person and uh business uh-huh so uh you know yes oh are you oh we raise orchids oh my which is a little bit tough to do up here in the north but it's a solar greenhouse we put up you know like the walls are six inches thick yeah yeah well do you not have shade cloths and so forth and uh-huh well no no we used uh fiberglass we're faced the the greenhouse faces solar south yeah yeah and it's it's double glazed fiberglass with a one inch airspace in between it yeah so it's kind of opaque we don't use shading on it um but we do have to uh have air a lot of air movement even in the wintertime it can get uh brutally hot in there so the way it was designed was to uh uh i put a four foot foundation under it and put in twenty two ton of rock with with uh hot air piped through it um-hum and all day long it just heats up and then at night it just gives it back into the house well great great so it's it's not bad it's it's uh i'd like a little bit warm land i'd like to go up further north and i'd like to instead of having a salt box i'd like to have it all on on one floor yes well come south and uh you will already you will be watching the azaleas bloom and go they are just about gone this time of the year that's right you guys must yeah because the actually the winter hasn't been really bad we're all no huh-uh everything's green all the leaves are out and all that so it's pret ty so you got your garden planted my spinach yeah sir it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh really well for not summer crops summer crops it's uh it's really not time to plant okra not quite the ground isn't warm enough but uh some of those yeah no i uh i put down black plastic um-hum um-hum to help heat it up you know put it on the radishes and spinach but spinach kind of bolts quick on us so we put it Swiss chard instead yeah yeah right get that out early um-hum um-hum so anyhow that's what we've done for our house we've left it all natural so there's no upkeep you know it's white cedar shingle sure yeah and the trim is stained so i don't have to go out and scrape and paint because i figured when i got old and retire i don't want to be working i don't be a slave to the home no no you don't want to be on ladders do you you don't want to be on a ladder um right right because that peek is twenty eight feet high and you come off twenty eight feet and it hurts so um-hum um-hum well it certainly has been enjoyable talking to you this morning and uh hope to hear from you again sometime if they do that yes you too okay yeah all right you take care okay bye-bye good-bye thank you  okay guess we can go ahead um well i guess you know it's you know since living in Dallas it's always so hot so in the summertime i just i wear lots of shorts so because i don't work during the day um-hum so do you work yes uh-huh yeah i do work um oh and but i work at a manufacturing plant so i wear a lot of blue jeans and T-shirts uh-huh uh-huh but occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress and high heel shoes and i feel really uncomfortable doing that and in the plant so uh it's it's a problem for me uh-huh yeah uh-huh but normally i just wear blue jeans and a T-shirt very very comfortable i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes uh-huh yeah yeah and buying suits and stuff yeah because just being at home and i work at home so um-hum i just have you know i just wear my you know my shorts and stuff like that i don't go out and spend lots of money on uh different you know suits and stuff you know um-hum um-hum but when i before i got married you know i was working so i uh you know i had more suits and stuff then but right worry about all that kind of stuff well i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because i'm like you when i first started working um uh-huh i have all these suits and blouses and skirts and mix and match and that kind of stuff uh-huh but now that i you know work in the manufacturing plant then it's just it's so much more difficult for me to to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that right um but occasionally i have to because uh part of my job is teaching and training and uh so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal grab uh-huh when you're training right yeah than your normal garb but i'm like you too uh i moved from Ohio down to here uh-huh moved somewhere i mean and i had mostly polyesters and wools and winter clothes and buying all these cotton clothes and then of course you have to iron them all the time that's really that's been a problem for me winter uh-huh uh-huh yeah because i came from Wyoming and i had wool suits and wool skirts and you know i've got all these clothes that i never wear because you can't wear them here and um right right the seasons are just so much different you have so much summer um-hum and uh so then when i you know i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear that's true that's true yeah well i know i was just now um uh putting away a lot of my winter clothes uh-huh and i was going through here and i was thinking i haven't worn this in three years yeah and because it's a wool skirt and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it and i have five or six wool skirts yeah uh-huh so i was thinking well maybe you know i need to think about getting rid of them but no i folded it up neatly and put it away maybe next year yeah you hate to get rid of it because you know how much you spent on them um-hum um-hum and it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff i know i know i agree with you so well i know last year uh well this past winter it wasn't that cold uh-huh but the previous winter we had more uh cold weather where i was able to actually wear your double and triple layerings of uh clothes yeah like you would when you're up north so uh-huh clothes yeah uh-huh that's really interesting yeah yeah and i i just don't spend you know right now my clothes come from Target you know yes yes yes and they're all one hundred percent cotton and yes and they you take them out of the drier and they're wadded up in a ball yes yes i know so i uh i have my ironing board sitting out all the time i never put mine away oh i'm so glad to meet somebody that that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house it is it is you know i have very little furniture but my ironing board is part of my decor so that's true and and i've been looking at these um uh like in Home Depot where you can go and they've got that ironing boards that will just flip right down off of the um uh what the the the door and uh and then you can have actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall you know to have it permanently attached and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom and it's just uh-huh uh-huh it's just an eyesore i think with all the well yeah it is it is but it's like uh i just don't want to do it hum-um hum-um no i've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet yeah uh-huh and and running you know a line in there for my iron so i could do it in there and i wouldn't have to have that eyesore yeah that's an idea oh yeah yeah so i have a big closet yeah i you know if i have if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room i will put it away but um-hum yeah i iron our clothes as we go along so you know um-hum i no longer do that weekly thing because i have so many and i'm like you i the night before or that day i will iron whatever it is that we need and that's it because it's too many hundred percent cotton right no uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh you can't iron it all and um-hum yeah and then with my kids they're always getting into you know they can't decide what they want to wear so they change their minds you know i know i mean my oldest is only four but she's um-hum um-hum changes her mind two or three times before she figures out what she's going to wear so right right oh i know i know and then they never put anything back no no of course not no that uh that would be too simple so uh-huh yeah that that that's called smart you know they don't we don't do that kind of stuff you know absolutely not that's called too easy on mom that's right our lot in life is to make her life miserable so uh-huh absolutely absolutely um oh yeah well that's it's been good talking to you to see somebody hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do and they just go oh how do you do that it's like it's easy you just do it you know that's right that's right you do you do so uh but yeah i uh i know several of my girlfriends though we uh we all keep our ironing boards out and just uh an ever present thing in our household so uh-huh yeah yeah i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there you know my husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes you know there you go things that need to be mended things that have to get ironed um-hum um-hum um-hum that's true yeah he wouldn't know where to put things so yeah so oh well it was nice talking with you oh it was nice talking with you too okay take care uh-huh bye-bye take care bye-bye  so i own uh a PCAT at my home uh-huh i could never justify owning a personal computer at at home uh i mean that's quite an expense to look for uh well well well who is this what do you do use yours at home for well that's actually a good question my wife works out of the home uh our home she has an office and it sits actually sits in the office and she uses it to compose and print out letters okay well now so that's a a very regular use of it that she has uh-huh and then in addition to that i tinker around with it i'm a computer scientist oh and so i write programs to do little things i'm actually working on a data base at home just just to keep track of things nothing special and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will you know kind of like remind me of things uh like remind me that Wednesdays is trash day and the like although uh-huh well excuse me i uh uh well i'm i'm a technician electronics tech and years ago TI sent me to their uh computer school down in Austin hum-um um-hum um-hum so uh i learned to repair one but you know i never really learned to operate one oh that's a key thing well actually there's that's a there's really two issues to that that there's so many packages software packages available today that just require no programming yes so that you you in other words when someone built that software package they had to use the programming but if they were careful they could uh make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works um-hum but i think you you you really hit the nail on the head for the average person is exactly what he can use it for and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending out letters or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage or whatever there your issue is then there really is well uh space is a handicap with me i live in a motor home oh i see wow and i'm preparing for retirement i see well congratulations on that hey i'm not too far from it another year and a half yeah well actually uh one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap that yes definitely the just like the computers um-hum uh remember how they started out running three four hundred dollars right oh the calculators you mean now i mean calculators calculators i beg your pardon yeah yeah uh-huh yeah they sure do yeah i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum you can actually buy a whole a whole brand new computer with a not not a uh necessarily a slow one or or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars you're kidding including a printer no hm that well actually actually i wasn't including a printer but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars so make it seven hundred a hundred yeah wholly smoke uh a respectable one yes uh-huh um-hum well see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them but i'm i'm that does amaze amaze me yeah the prices have plummeted you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply the box and the mother board of a a type of computer called an 8088 for about two hundred dollars um-hum hum and then the keyboard is another fifty the monitor with the card that drives it is another hundred and then the disk drive is two fifty and well what what is a a a good brand a for inexpensive well that's the that's the deal is you're not buying brands now you're buying these knock offs so there's uh probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one there's there's a magazine called Computer Shopper huh huh it's a it's a big magazine i mean it's it's twelve inches across uh narrow the narrow side and and fifteen fifteen seventeen inches the tall side and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages but the book is the magazine is full oh wow of these mail order computer mail order houses and they're all competing with each so you just flip through there until you find a 8088 computer um-hum that's that's called that's the original PC so it's be called a TI PC i'm sorry an IBM PC compatible and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors for forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board board for twenty five dollars which is amazing to me and just you mix and match and then you do it by mail order hum but there's no real brands there's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards the main computer the circuit board i see how do you go about getting one of those uh catalogs they're available in you know the B Daltons that that type of thing um-hum you'll notice it in that it's it's a it's a very it's although it's a magazine it's large and like i said it's about an inch thick um-hum well getting back to the PC's i'll tell you i uh first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me and secondly i learned did learn this much about computers they're they're they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten in binary that's right that's great well anyway that's one of my favorite jokes about that oh yeah one and one equals ten yeah that's great course you it's it's kind of an inside joke you know yeah you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary i understand that's great that's a good joke so what do you uh uh work with uh computers uh at TI well what i did for years and then i was was a scientist over in central research labs and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing uh-huh so i now i i type that one but i don't use it anymore um-hum well i just recently started using one uh connection with my work i don't um-hum yes uh i keep track of an inventory here and of course now that is where a computer is is very handy um-hum yes i agree and well i it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated oh yeah uh see i'm with the QRA lab oh i see that's fascinating qualification and evaluation so naturally our equipment has to be in in top condition and is constantly calibrated and they're dated um-hum so i have to keep up with them uh and it's very handy doing it on the computer yeah i just run a printout every week and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm what i have to do what i have to ship what i should be expecting to be returned um-hum so uh it it is handy right and i must admit that up until i did start using one uh it was i had very little interest in computers yes but they are amazing yeah they certainly are so let's see so i guess with respect to the question yeah i i guess we've we've kind of covered it well i think we did great nice little conversation with you Jack good good day thank you good same to you yeah Mike you take care now good luck to you  unfortunately it's apparently the crime wave is not limited to cities you know it's spreading to you know our communities also and smaller right um right my i'm from originally from Palestine over in east Texas um-hum i'm originally from a little little rural town in southern Oklahoma yeah and uh the crime in in you know in east Texas is uh i i think it's just about as bad the burglaries and the drugs and stuff seem to have moved out into that area yes yes that is that's really scary it has it's done the same thing even in my little town and gosh it's only like a thousand people uh yeah but uh there's one deputy sheriff that tries to you know patrol the whole thing and he's you know he's just overwhelmed yeah right uh i guess uh it is really scary but the uh recognizing or i think recognizing that a lot of the crime in these smaller cities is really geared toward the the major cities anyway because i think that you know the people that are involved in the drug scene out in the rural areas are really out there to provide for the little you know the center cities that's right sure it's probably a safer environment for them but uh right but uh i guess the question is what do you do boy i who knows i don't know uh you know i think that uh from my own observation that that a lot of it probably stems around the school system i i don't want to blame the school system on everything because it's it's not what they're doing it's not that they're doing so much wrong as that they can't not cannot do a lot of the things that need to be done uh right well even even not just education but uh even discipline and and things like that are you talking about educationwise yeah um-hum that the schools are not allowed to do anymore that uh the students you know are just they have so much control over the schools themselves that that everything seems to turn around that that's right absolutely um-hum yeah yeah um you know as you know you watch the nightly news you know like i do and boy you know that's not a day or night that goes by in this in this area at least as somebody at least somebody doesn't get killed or raped or robbed during this um-hum right yeah the jillion others we don't even hear about probably i do uh i travel a little bit in my in my job with i've got some clients in California and i was in California when the police out there beat you know beat up on that um-hum yes that's been a hot topic yeah traffic deal yeah it's a real yeah really was and of and of course everybody's reaction to that was you know anger and disgust and shock and all of that but then when you turn around and look at at what's going on um-hum um-hum from the criminal element that that probably that does not even compare you know to what goes on crimewise um-hum yeah that's right that's right you never hear about and uh and you know some some of the crimes are so crazy you know just you know killing somebody for a five dollar bill or some stupid thing like you know you just you just never know you know it's i sometimes get concerned about you know driving down the down the street you know if you look crosswise at somebody they're liable to blow your head off yeah yeah it's really scary but uh you know i i i really don't i don't know what the answer is but i think that if we don't find an answer i don't know either soon that it's we're really going to be in a lot worse trouble than we are now yeah it's obviously not getting any better i think uh perhaps the Supreme Court has taken a couple of steps in the right direction recently uh i understand that they lightened up a little bit on some of the the restrictions on you know crime investigation and stuff so um-hum yes um-hum right um-hum and even down to the death penalty i think as far as you know appeal after appeal after appeal i think they've finally began to say you know enough's enough and you know right And say if you don't don't appeal yeah yeah to start with then you don't have the right to appeal that's right and uh you know i think the yeah a lot of people favor you know mandatory jail time with no no time you know no good time off you know i don't know i don't know if that's an answer or not i'm not too sure people are really scared of jail time anymore because they're in and out so quickly uh-huh i'm not sure that's a real scary item for them uh and it's that's uh that's a fact you you can you know it's look forward to a just a few days in jail sometime for you know for what would seem to be a major crime in um-hum with uh appeals and all that and getting time credit for spending time in jail and i think they even give credit sometimes for the the time they're out of jail between yeah um-hum um-hum between uh the time they're indicted and the time they're tried and stuff like that that still counts toward their sentence yes yeah right you know this building jails you know more jails the answer i'm not sure it is i don't know i honestly don't know i wish i did i'd be glad to share it with everybody if i knew yeah yeah That uh i guess uh the uh the number of of beds available in a jails you know we've got to have it to increase because the number of criminals are increasing but we've we really need to work on the other side you know to to yes yeah before they get to jail right but uh i don't know what yeah i agree i don't know maybe you know maybe maybe it needs to start at home you know with the parents as much as they can do you know parents can only do so much up to a point and they've lost it yeah well i think uh uh you know back to uh back to uh the the school situation the parents are the ones that that that demand all the rights for these students for the children um-hum right they they want to put so much restrictions on and and and you know then they don't take on the responsibility themselves that's right and uh so it's it kind of perpetuates itself i'll tell you the truth about both i have two children both of are are you know young adults grown and gone away from home i'm honestly glad i'm not raising children at this point and time yeah well i've i've got two that are they're still at home but they they think they're adults they're both out of you know out of high school one of them go to college yes um-hum and uh i we really were nervous about our son uh the second one um-hum uh going to school and you know Richardson schools are some of the best around um-hum absolutely and even at that it's you know it was a real touchy situation as to what you know as to yeah yeah it's no guarantee who the associates were there are students in every school system that's right that uh you don't want your kids associating with if you can help it um-hum that's right if you can help it that's key you know and uh you don't you know you don't have any control over it yourself that's right yep up to a point you after that you've lost it yeah right sure have i'm just glad i'm not raising young children anymore so um-hum yeah it's uh we said you know that we'd have been a lot better off our children would have been a lot a lot better off being raised in a smaller smaller area um-hum smaller town smaller school yeah um-hum or at least we thought perhaps at the time but you know um-hum i'm not so sure not so sure anymore we did have some friends that moved uh out into well out in rural Collin County yeah um-hum thinking that that would have been a you know a better place for their kids and before their kids got out of school the drug scene had moved in out there um-hum yeah that's right and you know so they you know it's not not a whole lot different there than it is no maybe just a smaller just a smaller scale maybe but then then you know the idea is still the same it's there in you know in town yeah yeah so it really is but well it's i don't know uh like i say i'm just glad i'm not trying to have to raise small children again yeah i'm glad that they're not expecting us to come up with all the answers on these phone conversations right yeah yeah they you'd think that what yeah me too in the time allotted no i don't don't think so but i don't i don't know anyone that isn't concerned about it well everybody's concerned but you know we give uh Congress and we give the state legislators the you know all these powers and authorities and everything and they they spend a lot of time on it and they can't come up with the answers so right um-hum that's right not to mention monies spent so but uh it's so i don't know wish i did yeah maybe we maybe it's uh it's time for there to be more people involved i guess in in trying to find the answer but yeah i guess so and since you know the police i'm sure are just you know maxed out there's only so much they can do yeah well they can all they can do is enforce enforce the laws they can't uh pass the laws and they can't run the the court systems and um-hum yeah you know they do their do their job i don't i don't have a lot of complaints about the police myself um-hum no i don't either as a matter of fact i think they're doing you know probably for the most part the best job they can do with resources they have it's really must be discouraging though to know that you know you bust somebody for something they may be out on the street before you finish your report you know but they're doing yeah yeah we um-hum well that's got to be discouraging especially if you've risked your life to do course you know if you're a cop you expected to risk your life that's uh my wife said the other day said she just couldn't do that couldn't be a police officer because you're you know you never know that's right what uh you know you stop by somebody for traffic accident and you walk up and they um-hum they've got a gun pulled on you or you know something of that kind and yeah um-hum as i understand it talking to a couple of my police friends what they fear most is a call to go try to settle a domestic quarrel you know apparently it's very dangerous you just never know right yeah because yeah you you've got a they get a a domestic uh violence or domestic domestic dispute and they get there and both of the parties turn on them um-hum um that's right apparently it's very very dangerous situation um-hum no i don't i don't think i could be a cop i really don't yeah so well you think there's anything else to talk about on this subject okay well it's been nice talking to you okay thanks bye i guess that's that's pretty well it nice to talk to you uh-huh bye-bye  okay um what type of music do you like well pretty much uh the thing i'm into mostly is new age uh like Yanni um oh uh Peter Barden uh uh-huh gosh there's just so many of them i can't even can't even name them all Enya i just got a catalog just now as a matter of fact uh actually my husband got it uh Lady Slipper Catalog and it's it has music from a lot of women and it's got uh Enya in it and Carol Nessin have you ever heard of her no i have not what what is the the message what is the underlying theme of new if heard of new age music but i don't i wouldn't know how to identify it well actually most of the music that i listen to there's no theme it's instrumental oh really um and i tend to like instrumental better because there isn't that underlying theme there's no message to be get gotten there um it's just enjoying the melody what that's what i like about music okay what separates that from something such as jazz music or you know well um i guess you could tend to categorize some of the stuff like i like in into jazz uh Jean Luc Ponty is he's kinds of a he's he's jazz but he's kind of more of a contemporary type jazz he's got the um the electric violin uh-huh um um my husband just said before i switched to this other phone he said so you like the Dixie Dregs and that's is another one of my favorite groups but it's they're kind of in a group by themselves really so they're more they're more like progressive okay they're progressive in that it's just the same up beat tempo type or instruments they use um no progressive music is more like they have real complex um uh rhythms and key uh key changes uh-huh um it's it's a more complex it's it's not your your typical top forty type that has um it'll it'll be in a particular key or whatever and it it doesn't change uh-huh um progressive has a lot of different um i don't know it's it's a lot more complex okay what does this type of music have to do like when i go to the book store and i see new age books does this have anything to do with that no no that's really a lot of groups don't like to be called new age because it's kind of a a label that it it kind of kind of connotates the out of body experience like the uh-huh um Shirley MacLaine type thing and that's not it at all yeah okay it's it's just a different type of music and i guess um i guess you would really call it contemporary jazz okay that's that's good and is this becoming more widely available i think so um do you ever listen to one oh six no um um they play some of the stuff that i like although they've gotten them they've gotten to a lot more into the saxophone stuff and i don't really care a whole lot for saxophone like um Kenny G yeah he's okay but um i like more of a variety and it seems like they are playing all of this saxophone type music that enough is enough you can only handle so much of it yeah so so you could label Kenny G as a new age well yeah he's kind of a new age okay i was wondering kind of a jazz new age all right it kind of kind of depends on how you look at it okay i i've listened to one of his disks probably about a month ago and and uh-huh what did you think of it i thought it was talented i thought you know he's a you know has definitely a lot of talent and i i wouldn't buy it for myself but i was glad to listen to it you know i'd uh-huh yeah i saw him in concert several years ago and he is puts on a really good show seems like he does he really is incredibly talented yeah well that's cool what what what kind of music do you like to listen to mostly um i'm very um open i listen to a little bit of anything i've got i listened to rock and roll a lot when i was growing up so a lot of the groups that have been well established for a long time such as you know like Tom Petty or you know the Eagles uh-huh yeah i know most of their stuff and i continue to purchase their latest releases as long as you know they don't sell out and still stick within their you know their certain style yeah i i like top Tom Petty until he got to be kind of top fortyish yeah like his first two albums were really good they're real real you know nitty gritty down to the i mean real roots of rock and roll and i really liked that yeah when he got to doing his um um didn't he do a he did an album with who was it Stevie Nicks i think yeah yeah they sang a couple of tracks on one of her albums and that was okay but i liked his early stuff a lot better yeah i was really i'm really impressed with his latest the what was the name of the latest album i have it it's um i like it you know it's you've got some top forty hits and i'm sure you know he's geared to that but there are some songs that are pretty cool on that and you know with the videos and stuff now coming out yeah he may be softening up little bit but you know i still like his voice and you know he's not you know it's not that bad um i also like Christian music a lot uh-huh i like um i like um i like orchestra i like symphonies classical music uh-huh because i like some classical except that i have a really hard time going to buy it because some of it is just really awful and some of it is really good and i don't know the good from the bad right you don't know until you listen to it so excuse me yeah unless you have someone that can loan it to you or you go to the library and listen to it yeah it's kind of hard just to yeah the one one classical piece that i really do like is Vivaldi's Four Seasons yeah i really like that and i like i like some Beethoven yeah um and that's really all that i've really sampled that i why i should say i i have listened to some others that i like that i can't remember their names offhand my husband makes all these tapes of all different artists and i never know what i'm listening to i just know that i like it so so if you walk into your home then you stick something in you're you're not sure what what would you stick in if you come home and just could you turn on a station or stick in an album or disc i'd i'd probably put a CD on and i would i would probably probably most likely go to something new age i would probably Carol Nessin or um or Yanni or somebody like that um once in a while i'll put on some classical um sometimes my husband has a whole variety of music so i really have pretty much anything to choose from uh-huh well um i do like a lot of the older stuff too but we don't really have a lot of the older stuff on CD um and that's pretty much all i listen to did you i i hardly ever listen to the radio anymore did you say one oh six yeah has the new age station now are where do you live yeah i live in Carrolton okay we live i live in Sherman so i'm not sure if i'll i can receive that station or not but i will try and i'll you know listen for a while oh okay okay and see what it sounds like Stephanie was it yeah well uh thank you very much for talking and uh maybe we'll get hooked up again sometime okay great thank you all right talk to you later okay bye bye-bye  huh okay i don't know how much i know about this subject well i don't know if i know anything or not but i've i've got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at don't know anything yeah okay go ahead yeah well uh i've had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a more far more disadvantaged viewpoint that's true uh i personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though um me either i i went to college and then started working and then got married and but they have i read somewhere and i'm i'm out on a limb here some type of college uh volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh lower income brackets of the United States have you ever heard about that one no i haven't i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south Texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever oh really um-hum if it's like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you don't obviously you don't need as much as far as to you know to live and this is money that she's borrowed to for her college education yeah she only taught there one year but i but she got credits for it um-hum that's very interesting and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh i mean it's a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that that's a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping hum people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and it's it's beneficial to the small towns too because they really really yeah have have a disadvantage that we don't understand because we're in the Metroplex as far as getting yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldn't be convenient yeah but we could find one we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that um-hum yeah so i i can see the advantage to that one the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isn't it i really don't know that much about it you know i i i think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and don't they go into other countries and stuff it's still in existence i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm um-hum uh dig their own wells set up their schools things that make them yeah make them more self-supporting yeah yes they it's not a program to teach them to use the American money it's a program to teach them to be more self-reliant right yeah and yes you're right i think it's a sixties program i think it was one of Kennedy's hot points that he that was his big deal but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it right right um i think i i i i've singled out my grandchildren and but actually they're they're pretty good um-hum along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other people's children and grandchildren mine aren't really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good yeah but there's a i don't i don't know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i don't know that that would work if if somebody's mandatory just like like the draft no every time you have was didn't really want to be there and didn't have yeah i mean there'd be loopholes just like there is in anything else they could buy their way out right you know they they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but i'm wondering if there's another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out can you go into and this wasn't the question but it's it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults can they go in there and can anyone go into well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and doesn't do any good yeah i don't know that it does i i i don't know that um yeah if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out you know we're losing certain races of people there are people now um-hum that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete um-hum and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out there's a German word for it that's elegant but i never can remember what it was uh but but they're they're being winnowed because they're where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially right yeah um and uh one of the quick examples is the aborigines yeah um-hum uh when we were in Australia uh sad little things uh i felt sorry for them because their society isn't there anymore and their belief system and all all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone essentially yeah and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i that don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either yeah really yeah so i i'm wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool well and here with the Peace Corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped good point we've got enough without leave without a passport there's plenty yeah yes i think we ought to worry about our own species and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the United States i wonder now in and i've been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses there probably are you know for but i'm sure that's probably like people that do that are social are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that it's everybody's responsibility to um help these people you know and not i'm not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be yeah i mean i know that's what my father-in-law was talking about you know when you give these people that's the last thing you want to do money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people i mean and that's not really the answer i mean because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but yeah that's exactly it they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on let's be realistic that's just not realistic yeah or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean right i guess we're getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean it's no we're not i don't think i think that's more realistic than going making them go in the Peace Corps true yeah i think that's a lot more realistic uh i i think that we should be spending more time and and again i don't think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because it's not it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore yeah uh we've got plenty in fact we've got far too many you're in uh what Flower Mound Flower Mound yeah so we're a little farther you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing i was that's exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recently  uh i guess i've had to return something but i'm can't can't decide mostly it's been because i didn't like the color uh-huh or um i'm not sure whether i've had to return that many things uh well i'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned so for me it's actually a pretty good topic oh are you okay good so we'll talk about that some yeah well we could talk about that and then we could talk a bit about um just quality of products in general if you they're better or worse like if they last longer or something like that right okay i'm going to let you kind of lead the pack because you sound like you're i let let me tell you just a little bit about myself i for years i did all that shopping and what not but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem and i've had two cornea transplants uh shopping is no fun anymore i can't i can imagine well actually i don't see good enough you know and uh it's hard to tell what i'm doing and it's just aggravating oh i just thought of something we have to return all right it'll it'll come to us okay are you ready you can't read labels and you can't good there you go okay yeah Laurie all right right all right uh tell me about your computer Laurie i think that sounds fascinating well we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project and we called up the company and asked them details on it we bought it sort of your not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper uh-huh and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with and they were very happy with the system and they felt they've gotten a good price and we went in we explained what we needed and yes we had to go across the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey to get to meet these people um-hum and so we went there we told them about the stuff and the guy said uh that the computer would fit our needs and we these things won't make any sense to you probably but he told us there were we need user positions to put our own equipment in the computer um-hum oh yes and it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called uh-huh and he told us there's two sixteen bit slots and two eight bit sorry two sixteen sixteen four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user and we can put full size cards in there and so we said great you know we'll buy it and we put in our order and a week later we went back and picked up the computer and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it and there's only one slot we could put it in oh lovely and at this point we only have one board so it wasn't so bad so we used it a bit but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in hm now now the computer was supposed to have two and well it has them but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it in it oh i see and even though they told us in advance that you could they told us there'd be no problem because you know the salesman just doesn't really know oh i see in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it they probably didn't know what they were talking about right that's completely it the salesman didn't know so we went back in and we struck an agreement with the people they'd change right the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards huh okay so they did that and we said are you sure that this will work we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway and etcetera and they're and they were doing it at their own costs and so we said fine and we went back and we talked to the technical person a second time and things like that and then we come we get the computer home my husband goes to pick it up last week and we couldn't go get it sooner because i just had the baby and you know life's just a little bit complicated and uh he goes and gets it brings it home first of all they're missing uh-huh components of it like cables so you can't really test it out and then second thing we still can't put the boards in because they have other things blocking where we need to do it oh dear huh and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again and they say they can you know do something different and change some connectors and we hope so but it's a hassle you know you know it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing yeah it really is what goes on right and time and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction i think that's the worst part uh i right so well actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation and they said well you don't have to pay for it yet now that's an advantage isn't it it really is i think uh uh there's a lot not to be said for credit but that's one thing to be said for credit it how it gets you some muscle where you need it yes yes yeah right and so you know and i think that's really really important well because these guys if they um give us a hard time we're going to say you look you know if you if you can't fix this to our satisfaction we're just returning the computer yeah that's right that's right and if we do that i just tell the credit card company don't pay the charge even though they've already paid it but they'll just you know undo the credit that they did to them that's right no yeah they will that's right they will they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do yeah we Hal bought me uh uh small uh well uh uh yeah right and little jam box kind of thing so i'd my i have my ninety three year old mother living with us and so i uh she doesn't remember anything but to keep her entertained music and some of these things do help and i thought well if i had uh a nice a nice little uh um-hum tape recorder you know so that i could put some good music on in there for her every once in a while and then also so that i can uh uh copy uh parts off i i do some musicals and things like this and if i can copy sections off that i can use someplace so i figured well this'll be good well the first uh uh the first time i turned it on uh-huh uh i was recording and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the thing oh no okay so after that then you couldn't get a you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side um-hum and then on the other side when i when i uh i loaned loaned it to my daughter the other day to take it over to a to a videotaping they were doing and uh she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far and so you can't you you can't get it to run the right the right way either so uh yeah so i i wish i could tell you i really don't know which brand it is uh um-hum what brand is it do you know but i was wondering like you know in our case we we knew we were buying a copy we weren't buying an IBM PC and i was wondering if you yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're going to get just take it back but uh uh-huh did you buy it at some major store yeah i think just uh just uh one of the major major i think it was a you know i don't i think it was uh you know like a Highlands or something like this Highlands because it's obviously a chain down there that i don't know up here nope do they have Highlands up there don't they well this is it was a regular uh electronics store store you know so i don't think i don't think there'll be too much problem but i i guess i'm not sure whether i think uh-huh things are not made as well i think they deliberately sometimes um i think a lot of things are not made as well don't you what what for instance what are you um oh well gosh it's hard to think of an exact example but i think that um yeah they just get they're getting a kind of a attitude of not i just yeah i just have well i like electronic stuff you know for one thing i know their work you know cars i think are not made as well as they could be yeah well cars yeah yeah i think that's right the fact that um because i they want people to replace it after a couple of years right the fact that they that they have have competition with the Japanese and whatnot sometimes uh dwells on a fact that you know uh i've had i've known people who have had Toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them well they may cost a little more but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day um-hum yeah i had a Toyota and i loved it my Toyota did really well yeah yeah it does the they do a good job so part of it is that we need to develop more of a of a pride in in uh the kinds of things we do so we make them better good yeah and it kind of has to start from the top and and go clear or from the bottom maybe and go clear up people well i i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship the people just don't care about what they're doing you know the whole nobody cares nobody's nobody's really paying no no yeah attitude is is just get me my dollar so i can go do what i want to do and on what i'm doing right i think that's too bad and it's a shame too because um right give me my paycheck so i can go home when you get right down to it most things there isn't any if you do a good job nobody can pay you enough there isn't any way to get paid enough yeah but if if you do a good job you feel enough satisfaction so whatever you're paid is enough yeah and also i think well i do research and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever whatever work gets done but uh-huh and you get satisfaction out of it and that's right i think they underestimate how much how much value the satisfaction is but i think a lot of it you know i think things come both from the uh individual side and also from the company side because the companies that let give the attitude that well you know you're the last one hired so you'll be the first one fired and we just want you to do your days work and we don't really care about you as an individual when you've got that type of attitude on the people don't care about their work and so no yeah yeah yeah it probably it probably basically goes right back into the home home though unfortunately starts with the one person that you know and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay you know little value just in whatever you do yeah the the the that the value is in doing it well and doing a good job of it  just outside of Dallas uh-huh my mother used to work at the Plano location i think she moved back down into closer into Dallas yeah so okay let me let me hit one hold on a second here okeydoke well punch one we'll get started okay okay okay i guess my my favorite eating out uh food is Mexican food uh-huh Tex-Mex not real Mexican food that real Mexican food is too hot um okay uh my favorite i have a lot of favorites i like to try a lot of different things uh there's very few foods that i don't like i don't like asparagus and beets and anything else i can pretty much eat uh recently i went to a French restaurant and i had something called uh spinach fettucini and crawfish hum and it was so delicious i've been talking about it it's my birthday and i've been talking about it ever ever since it's been about a week now i've been talking about this plate of food and uh the real important part of it for me in a restaurant is the service huh uh-huh uh in this particular French restaurant was our problem to be going back again and again uh they were three waiters that waited on the entire restaurant they just all kept an eye on all the tables yeah yeah and something that really impressed me was that i asked one waiter for butter and then the next second another a different waiter brought the butter out and and they hadn't even talked or anything and it was it was really amazing and so that really impresses me the service in a restaurant yeah yeah well i i like a restaurant i like a restaurant that uh not necessarily for atmosphere you know uh the atmosphere isn't worth a dime if the food is good and the service is lousy uh-huh exactly and this little old Mexican restaurant we have right up here from the house i i don't guess it'll hold more than twenty people uh-huh and it's just a little small restaurant pardon me and it's uh just kind of like a hole in the wall but the food excellent uh-huh and and the service is just excellent and the price is very reasonable and that's probably not a chain restaurant it's not a chain it's a little a family owned restaurant i find that most most family owned restaurant or or single restaurant you get the best service simply because that restaurant belongs to somebody it it it has the family name on it yeah right and so whoever's in there is going to take care of you as opposed to going into a chain restaurant where they're just hiring you know people out of that really don't probably don't care too much about the establishment so they're not going to worry about taking care of you yeah whereas someone that actually is there that owns it that you know has been working there for twenty years or so they want they want you to be happy so you get the service and you know of course with that will come the good food yeah yeah plus you you can go in after you you've you've uh uh gone to the place quite a few times uh they get to know you and uh uh you know appreciate you and say hello to you and how are you doing and uh-huh exactly exactly and all you got to do is sit down and say we'll have our usual uh-huh and uh you know it's just it's real nice and exactly the guy that took me out to this French restaurant he works in a hotel nearby and he just happened to mention to the waiter that he sends a lot of the people from the hotel over to the guy's restaurant yeah and and at the end of our meal you know we're ready to go and we're full and this guy sends us a platter of each dessert um that the restaurant has so it was like ten desserts on one plate and he just gave it to us to eat of course we couldn't eat it but you know he just did this and so the next time when we come in he'll probably remember us yeah yeah just because we looked so weird at the dessert you know but that that was yeah plus you go you go to a big fancy restaurant and uh uh some of the price that you pay for the meal is strictly for the decor and for the atmosphere and you can't eat that exactly exactly exactly one of my favorite restaurants is Steak and Ale now that's a chain sort of a chain restaurant yeah yeah but they seem to i like i like atmosphere myself and and their food is good and i really like the salad bar and that that gets me in a restaurant if there is really good salad bar because i love salads and soups and things like that yeah and i guess it depends you know if if it's just you and your husband going out to eat uh unless it's uh anniversary or something like that atmosphere doesn't mean that much but if you're taking another couple or taking relatives or friends or something you want the place you know to be nice right right but uh and also we we uh i would i i wasn't too much on Chinese food until i tried it and i really liked it uh-huh uh-huh and i even bought me a wok and doing my own doing my own Chinese cooking now but did you just recently try it uh-huh uh-huh yeah we've tried it a couple of time and even had uh uh relatives over and i cooked some out of that and boy they just lapped it up yeah uh-huh all right wow maybe i need to get me a wok and have some people over but uh we saw this one advertised on TV it's uh uh real real good wok it's hand hand uh uh-huh pounded not hand carved hound hand made of iron right right um it's not one of these aluminum or steel woks that you buy probably that it heats up real good and uh-huh heats up real good and and the meat and stuff doesn't stick to it like it will uh uh aluminum or uh stainless steel um and that was on a television advertisement one of them nineteen ninety five deals yeah okay uh-huh yeah yeah that sounds good yeah i don't like i've tried probably just about everything just because i don't like to and it uh yeah you know i don't i hate one thing i hate to do in a restaurant is to be with someone that want try things yeah because i'm also wanting to anything that they have i will try and uh you know sometimes i may not like it but i feel like i miss out you know if i had gone a long time without trying Chinese food i would have had to try it one day just because i hate to miss out yeah well i love i love those fried vegetables uh-huh especially the uh watercress and the crunchy the crunchy ones yeah yeah the little crunchy things i never know what they are i just call them the crunchers yeah huh yeah we like uh we like seafood too and we found a little ole another little ole hole in the wall that makes excellent fried catfish so uh-huh um boy it's good that sounds good i love catfish yeah i do too uh-huh and i love shrimp and we haven't tried any of their seafood and we again had some relatives here last week and we went took them there she had never had catfish she was from Connecticut uh-huh uh-huh and uh she had never had channel catfish uh and she tried the scallops i asked her if they were any good because i new the scallops were probably oh you know not local like catfish is right right but uh she said they were very good um yeah i don't like scallops too much their they have kind a funny taste i can eat them but they're and she yeah well being from Connecticut they're they're use to fresh seafood like shrimp and lobster and stuff like that uh-huh hum yeah yeah yeah i'm originally from New York i grew up there so i got to eat a lot of uh i mean just fresh fresh i mean one yeah one day we were out just driving and they are always uh oriental people with their little stands yeah and they're selling things and we decided we were going to buy this thing we didn't know what it was we got in the car and opened it up and started eating it and it was really really good and we figured out that it was octopus hm you know so we all kind of freaked out but you find all kinds of seafood things in up there where all the uh-huh yeah uh harbors are and things i never have tried octopus it sounds looks like it would be good because it's all meat there's no bones to it it's not yeah yeah yeah there's not a whole lot of taste it's just basically meat and there's not a lot of taste not a lot to eat not to like you know so unless you think it's bland or something yeah yeah yeah one of these days i would like to try a rattlesnake too i've heard that it's delicious um ah now that's something i may not try yeah i've heard that's good i've heard frog legs are good i haven't had any of those yet so i'll have to try those one day but uh oh i love frog legs yeah frog frog legs are good of course you know you ask somebody what meat taste like just about any meat you ask them had a it taste like they say like chicken uh-huh exactly but uh it does it's similar to chicken but the meat uh-huh the meat is sweeter uh-huh and if you've ever i use to go frog gigging as a kid and gigging the frogs and then uh and get their legs uh-huh right and the meat is it's crystal clear meat it's beautiful meat hum now it is a little bits stringy uh-huh uh because of uh because simply they're frog legs because they you know they have the muscles and so forth right right but it's it's it's sweet meat um i think my favorite meat is lamb now i don't i don't care a whole lot about lamb no i think i think it's it's got i like the texture of it is why i like it not so much the taste but the texture it's not real chewy or yeah yeah i mean it's just real good to me i can't really describe why but yeah lamb or veal i'm not real crazy over it yeah i like veal too but uh while i was i i've worked for Texas Instruments out in Ridgecrest California for eight years and one time we went down to uh Bakersfield uh-huh uh-huh and there was a Basque restaurant B A S Q U E um uh-huh and uh we stopped there and ate and i wish i could find another one here um i bet oh it was good they serve it family style everything in  so eating out what are you interested in in restaurants right um we eat out quite a bit it's just my husband and i at home now so oh uh once a week twice a week oh at least once a week we're we're retired now when we working out we ate out more than that yeah i understand uh uh but we both work and we have a daughter and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway uh-huh well what type of restaurant do you like Richard uh really i'm kind of open on food i'm what you might call a culinary adventurer i'll i'll try anything once right been on a real barbecue kick lately oh have you we like Chinese we eat a lot of Chinese food yeah excuse me uh yeah we usually have Chinese once a month uh-huh what do you look for in a restaurant uh i hate franchised restaurants you what you i despise franchised restaurants i i oh i always prefer to go to something that seems more family run uh right some place where you seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost i know what you mean i like some ambience and i like good food i don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that i don't but i don't like something fake or put on either uh uh-huh you know if i could have the the good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant uh-huh and i don't know why that is i think it's probably due to pricing often right uh-huh i don't care to go to a place just for the price of it huh well yeah yeah i mean it's uh continental French restaurant or something really yeah with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look for it is what you usually look oh isn't isn't it isn't no that isn't what i look for uh i try to get my money's worth right and uh not just that i try to well that's a big part of it i try to get my money's worth uh-huh you know and not just in quantity you know but but quality and and flavor and and texture and care presentation and well presentation's not always all of it either it's it's important well like we we've been eating some in a restaurant that that just changed hands recently and we're trying to give them a little patronage but but Sunday we went there and i had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes um-hum but i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce or something like that yeah yeah something a little extra yeah that's what i mean by right uh-huh and just for color if nothing else it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate yeah yeah what i miss up here is i'm originally a Texan and i'm miss home cooked Mexican yeah yeah home cooked Tex-Mex uh Mexican restaurants where Tex-Mex Tex-Mex it's not owned by an Anglo or a corporation right i know uh and we have a daughter in Texas and one in New Mexico and we've really gotten to like we like the real Mexican food better than the Tex-Mex yeah well there's real Mexican food and there's real Tex-Mex Mexican you know by third or fourth generation Americans right of the Hispanic heritage it's all pretty good isn't it oh yes and and there's big differences of course and uh-huh of course when you talk about Mexican cuisine you that's kind of like talking about American food or or a Chinese food because its regional too right uh-huh that's true you know i'm originally from Maine so we like seafood too and that's something we don't get here and we're in the mountains in Virginia ah and most of the seafood's frozen ah yeah that's the way it is here in Colorado also no fresh or almost no fresh seafood right and in Texas we got it from the Gulf uh-huh true lots of shrimp and yeah here a couple years ago my wife and i went to Seattle on vacation and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week and it was i know it i was like a man starving at every meal i know the feeling we do the same thing my son-in-law is a Texan and when he goes to Maine he eats lobster i guess at least twice a day all the time he's up there ha it's a lot cheaper there isn't it lobster oh yes yeah it's like it's like shrimp on the Gulf two ninety eight a pound for a pound lobster two ninety eight a pound yeah that's as cheap as steaks some places oh yeah or cheaper right yeah a lot of the restaurants you can get i mean in a grocery store yeah two pound two one pound lobsters for like ten ninety nine oh my gosh i've got to go to Maine then i you may have sold a trip for some time yeah it's a good place to go uh it sounds wonderful uh so lots of little restaurants too with home cooked food that up there that sound good i yeah down in the Gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little oh seafood shacks we've called them right uh-huh and uh it's just it so much different than to eat something that's been frozen uh-huh you know we went to Galveston shrimp straight out of the bay bay we were in Galveston last year after right after well the first of this year actually hm and uh ate in a restaurant and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the Gulf Coast was it true no it wasn't on the way across Louisiana we pulled off we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place and they had it was a small restaurant just kind of out of the way and they were set up with two buffets one for their regular Sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything and then one complete seafood buffet um that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways ah yes the cajuns uh-huh right it was wonderful they can they can do things to shrimp that that no one else can so have you eaten crawfish yet uh-huh uh i tried it but i didn't care for it not there but at my brothers i tried it oh as with anything it's preparation that's probably true it i wasn't hungry it wasn't a meal we just he went down and bought some at a local place that steams them just so we'd try them uh uh-huh it there's all kinds probably needed some cold beer with it and so you do eat out a lot quite a bit uh one of our other real problems with going out to eat Sunday morning brunches oh you know Sunday brunch all all you can eat brunches right we used to do that once in a while but we don't anymore uh we still find it fun uh-huh it's fun but it's just so much food hate to come away feeling uncomfortable but well am i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor do you well that makes a difference and so where do you go to brunches like hotels or restaurants there uh yeah uh actually one of our one of our favorites is a chain Shoney's oh yeah uh-huh and in spite of the we eat at Shoney's and in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chains chain restaurants uh we uh do like Shoney's pretty well but then there's a place up the pass up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to go to on some Sunday mornings drive drive up to i think it's about eight thousand foot elevation and oh and and drive through Woodland Park and go for a short drive in the mountains and have breakfast and uh-huh that sounds nice it it it's the way to spend a a nice Sunday morning right i imagine it is i think it's as much the the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch you know and it's not that far it's thirty miles uh uh-huh where out of which direction from out of which direction from there west uh-huh the Colorado Springs what west west out of Colorado yeah  uh i don't go to movies a whole lot but uh i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw Dances with Wolves which turned out to be an extremely extremely good movie i haven't seen that yet i i i hear we a whole bunch of us were going to go see it the it's it's playing at school actually in about in about in about two weeks i guess so we're going to go see that but you enjoyed that yeah it's it's something that uh my my brother lives over in Fort Worth and i was telling him about it couple of weeks ago and he said well i'll wait until it comes out on uh tape and and rent the the video and i said no this is not one that you want to do that with that's what i heard yeah it's uh the the scenery and the the landscape and and the country that they're in needs a big screen it's just beautiful country in in the hills and the the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing it's just uh just an amazing amazing picture yeah i've heard it it it's not one for the videos no it's it's one i think well you know every every now and then you find one that you say yeah this is my favorite movie well this this is the one for me this time really yeah what have you been to lately um let's see well um this is almost sort of funny i was just at um friend and i went to see Out for Justice which is uh Steven Seagal yeah uh-huh because uh we're both big karate fans so we wanted to see what this is like and uh wasn't very impressed with actually oh yeah is that right that was yeah i wasn't i mean i've i've seen his other movies and he i i just think he's pretty good but uh this movie it's just i'm convinced now he can't act so yeah uh how's his karate oh his his his his karate's been pretty good i think in this one it wasn't so good i generally um movies like that scare me though i'd i'd be just fine without them because you know kids come running out wanting to beat each other up and you well they they do they get i remember when we used to go to uh see well i remember when Grand Prix came out when i was a kid and and some others movies like that we wanted to jump in the cars and and race fighting um-hum right and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it yeah yeah well that that was number one for the week actually too so so it was a little bit uh i was thinking wow people must be into crime movies again yeah but but in the middle of that conversation we sort of picked an um an an interesting point last year's number one movie for the year was Ghost is that right i don't know if you saw Ghost or not i did see Ghost yeah except yeah and and and that was that that helped us sort of feel good about you know about ourselves and about that everyone around us in that in that um at least at least if everyone's if if if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that at least they're still going to see the real good movies you know yeah i think that that Ghost was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good and it turned out to be an excellent movie yeah yeah it was it was i was absolutely enthralled by it i i i've forgotten the guy's name who was in it who had the lead role yeah and i especially like him uh oh Patrick Swayze yeah he's he's very good he's a really a really good guy other than that Dances with Wolves seems like to be the the only thing i've seen in the past several months to have any uh really i'm trying to think what else i've seen recently what else have we seen recently oh you know what's pretty cute actually um Defending Your Life is that right i've i've seen the ads for it but i'm not really sure what it's about have you have you heard of this yeah um i actually hadn't heard anything about it and some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie and and they said it starred um Meryl Streep and Mel Brooks at first they told me and i thought what a strange combination Mel Brooks and Meryl Streep yeah that is a strange combination well actually it starred out that it that it's actually Albert Brooks oh so so it's lot better um Mel Mel Brooks you you probably know is uh you know so it it was a strange combination but it turned out to be a very cute movie i mean the whole premise is that they go out and they they die yeah oh yeah and and they have to both of them right both of them are dead and they happen to meet in this this town um this this sort of city where you're set up such that you know they go and they decide if you can move up to the next level uh-huh i don't know if you've ever read Jonathan Livingston Seagull but it's something like that it's something like that they sort of move up to levels and and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough and as it turns out you know it's uh they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that yeah years ago oh so you can guess the rest of the plot it actually it's it's really funny because they run through you know they do it they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives oh yeah and then defend it well i guess that's where the title comes from then and that's pretty good actually yeah and it oh that's that's what you do you actually have to go up there and you have a they have an attorney for you know attorney for you and attorney a a a defense and a prosecution and they have the you know the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level and the defense's job is to make sure that you you do you know and it's uh it's a neat little story actually yeah yeah it is it's i was i was i was i i went i went in thinking it'll be okay not great and then i actually came away thinking it was really pretty good so yeah it's funny we've got a couple of movies out recently Ghost and Defending Your Life that have to do with uh after life i guess and it kind of makes you wonder i'm a also besides working at TI i'm a graduate student at here North Texas and working on a master's in communication yeah it's the behavioral science part of communercation and i i i think about these things and and people trying to define their own world view and uh what what exactly do we you know do we see about this world or why are we so fascinated with the other world is it just supposed to be better hm the other world yeah yeah sometimes i think we we think it is and we like those things that way well i'm i'm i'm sure because it seems like it certainly would would would explain the preoccupation with it lately i mean but i suspect there's always been a preoccupation with that sort of thing in movies well it has all all the way through history there's uh i guess if you want to call it mysticism or the occult or whatever it's always fascinating i guess because we don't know and there's no real way of finding out well there's only one way of finding out right well well did you ever see um Flatliners no i did uh did not the a girl next to me saw it and she really liked it that that that's probably one of those ones that you know it's it's on video now i think and it's probably probably worth seeing on video um actually we really enjoyed it but it was it was it was also right along the same lines i mean they they would go ahead and kill themselves for a few three or four minutes to see what happens and yeah it is yeah yeah they say uh she said that this was uh almost believable that could really happen you know you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things and it you know you never know almost yeah i i it's it's it's a little far fetched to find a bunch of medical students doing it but yeah but it was um it was it was odd enough you know and the and they didn't just sort of make it silly it was you know it was done fairly well i think so act ually i actually enjoyed that as well i yeah i like it when they will will do something and not get too silly i've been disappointed in some movies that okay um they don't know how to end it it seems like so then they get crazy and and it doesn't end like the story has been going um-hum the story just sort of keeps going and going yeah yeah well i guess that covers our topic uh the yeah great well it was nice nice talking to you alrighty bye-bye nice talking to you bye  i just pressed my uh we're supposed to talk about recent political developments i got one that's interesting not too controversial not too controversial i you know not doesn't matter whether you're Democrat or Republican i i do get somewhat of a kick out of because Schwartzkopf or the other generals who i admire how everyone wants to make get them in politics i think that's kind of an interesting recent thing that that i could think of recently that uh i was wondering what you thought about that making the generals uh um-hum yeah um-hum getting a general into politics they want him because he's popular not because he can do the job right although i've i've been thinking about it and i uh i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero those we're looking for a hero although Time magazine was saying that in essence the the general's staff yeah was comparing to corporate presidents and they said that in general generals are more familiar with training that they believe in training more um-hum they are much more educated than the average corporate president and so the really were very positive on a general's staff person having a a very much better education than the average uh corporate president so i thought well maybe yeah i i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman well that too that too and uh you know they talk about the Army and because of the war and why did we win and all that and they talked about how the training was so important and that's so important in industry so um-hum you know they're liable to be right that that generals generals in the service and Schwartzkopf uh you know might make a good uh politician whether it be Governor or whatever you know yeah he he you know we know he's a good leader we know he's a good organizer the question is you know can he be the man who's ultimately responsible you know like what he said is you know a lot of times in his interviews he was talking about you know people asking why are you doing this why are you doing that he says i'm following the orders of my President i'm not the one who writes the orders i'm just the one who follows them yeah it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs you know everyone has a boss of course um-hum well you know Schwartzkopf was ordered to get Iraq out of Kuwait yeah and so he went to the President and said okay here's how i want to do it but uh he wasn't the one that decided that Iraq needed to get out of Kuwait no that's true that's true uh-huh uh you you you pick one i i i just thought of that one when when they brought up about politics that was uh pretty easy yeah uh you don't have to pick Democratic or Republican you can pick anything you want go ahead well the the thing that i'm wondering about is how we get a new congress how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again well i have an easy answer for that oh i wish they would do it is that limit it you know to eight or ten years max you know whether that's two five year terms or whatever yeah i think yeah that may be our only answer but i don't really like it i don't like the fact that the President is limited in the number of terms he can serve oh you know you're not because i think if the President be him Republican or Democrat i think if the President can prove that he's popular you know that he can do the job then the people should be allowed to elect him as often as they want i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund-raising rules i mean yeah how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year did they get after they were elected just you know just after they were elected two years ago yeah basically the people as soon as they get elected the people dump all kinds of money on them and say yeah yeah you're my friend you're my friend and two years later he remembers that so what they've done is bought this congressman for two years yeah yeah i don't know i do like the the limitation of the President and uh i think there is a needed change i i i think the same thing should happen for Congress uh i'd like you know that would be my answer of an easy way to get these guys out of there for twenty years my God it's ridiculous you know yeah well um-hum that's that's the easy way i think the harder way out would be to make the uh the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground we had and that's that's what the financing rules and the uh the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff i think voting is a problem i think i had one of the subject about voting and uh voting apathy or something like that and i think that uh the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time i i can't believe that a country our big votes for a President from seven o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock at night you know of course they have absentee which is getting to be more a lot easier and i i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now but yeah um-hum i think gee whiz you could make it a couple days uh it's just uh if you really want the majority of the people to vote then give them a couple of days yeah well i think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about yeah yeah you know like you know the the recent uh election about how the Dallas City Council should be made up that election last December are you in Dallas i'm in yeah i'm in Dallas city limit boy i i am in Arlington i am so happy not to be part of Dallas when i see those those folks there um-hum yes it's an ugly mess i mean uh i don't know if you like the mayor but i think your mayor the city council the what is the woman's name whose uh not the mayor but the um-hum yeah the manager yeah the city manager all of them need to be thrown out i mean they're just awful they're awful yeah i don't yeah well what get's me you know this thing it went down to defeat last December by how many votes by just a few hundred votes um-hum and if if it had passed if these people had gotten out the vote it would have passed and there'd be no more argument but they're still fighting about it because of the way that election went last December i know it's so awful that uh politicians always spent consulting money that we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars um-hum to buy consultants and then they don't even do that recommendation you know i mean it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in yeah um-hum um-hum yeah but but this was for supposedly to benefit the minorities and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote and they would have had their way well you're right there you're right there uh uh people are uh uh politics uh the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really yeah it's pretty sad yeah it is uh uh hopefully people will get more involved uh um-hum uh my my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going oh yeah but but those are the ones that are complaining i i think a lot i see it here at TI yeah the guys that don't take any interest in and and constantly on the negative of everything um-hum and uh and and you ask them why they don't vote they say well they don't want their name on the uh jury duty list is that right ooh that that's where they get the jury duty list is from the voter registration list right you're right you're right i think they could do more about uh voting i think they could what are the issues i i'm a Democrat i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong Democrat i don't even know i could i could go out and and debate George Bush better than i see any Democrat doing it you know i mean at least i'd like to see competition because i like competition you know yeah and i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead i'm so disgusted with the Democratic party i can not believe it you know in Presidential races that's about what they've done but they've got a pretty good lock on Congress and a lot of local things yeah but i still think in the last uh ten years you know of course that's not a recent event that's only my opinion i guess that way i shouldn't talk about that but uh i don't know whether they're recent events i guess they were on this uh speech thing they want us to use a variety of words you know wight how many times have you called by the way i actually i haven't made any calls but i received about a dozen i i think yeah i have to make these but i get distracted and get to do something else and all of a sudden my phone rings and go oh what the heck we'll talk for a while oh really i i yeah i i've already got uh twelve cards you get any cards in the mail you know yeah we got a whole bunch i can't remember how many i don't know i'm amazed by of course we're not talking about politics but i am amazed by people say they got thirty i wonder why you need thirty renditions of the persons voice but i'm not in voice uh synthesis but i'd sure like to see a summary of it we'll get to politics i'm sorry you might be well i think we've used up as much time as we're supposed to anyway we're supposed to do five minutes and that was three minutes ago hey well thanks for the call yeah bye yeah right yeah yeah bye-bye  it's about this rap crap uh yeah uh it uh uh do you get it um not really not really i've uh i uh i've i'm forty years old now so i've uh oh so am i so we're talking the same language yeah we uh we we grew up with the same music and i just uh i heard song i heard uh what they call around here they have a thing they call uh oh what are they uh it's a spoof on the song and the song was um you you've heard of the song Dance to the Music you remember that oh yeah okay well they did a uh a uh twisted tune they call it and the twisted tune was Rap Isn't Music yeah indeed and they they sang here Rap Isn't Music to the tune of you know Dance to the Music it was pretty funny and to the music wow that's terrific well i just don't get you know like i remember when we were growing up how you know the Beatles and and and and and Presley uh you know how they were all condemned and rock and roll was the devil's music and it wouldn't last and all that yeah i i you know i keep thinking that you know i i uh uh uh are are we doing the same thing with this rap stuff i'm i mean at at at least with rock and roll it took talent that's true that's true now if you can just uh make a rhyme and sometimes not even a good one you know you yeah yeah you know all you got to do is is you know i it just amazes me and you don't even need a band because you can just use that uh crazy little radio to uh keep the time for you yes a scratchy record you know oh God yes i i mean i i can tolerate a lot of different things and i can you know i can tolerate a certain amount of of rap but if i have to listen to two songs in a row i'm ready to shoot somebody yeah really it's it it it i i just don't get it course i guess that dates us it means you are forty yeah that that must be it um my i get a real kick out of the uh these remakes of the old songs that we grew up with oh yeah now that that i do enjoy i do uh yeah you know and i've been hearing a lot lot more of it lately too yeah it makes you think that all the uh singer song writers are running out of you know things to write about well you know you know uh uh i know that somewhere you know i mean we we were really fortunate because you know we we had a you know the times of the Beatles and and and and things like that i mean you know that music is i really think the Beatles music will probably last you know um-hum yeah it it it they're immortal but uh i i just really don't know if uh what is it RBQ or whatever that i i don't even know run run run run run something uh run D Run DMC yes Run D i mean uh uh yeah yeah it'll never be elevator music let's put it that way uh no exactly exactly you know it is it going to be picked up by a symphony you know and and and yeah i know and you you'll you'll never hear it in the uh no in the restaurants and uh no well i don't know maybe you will but uh you know uh it it it just doesn't translate there is no melody yeah you know it it it's you know just give me shelter i've i've found that as i've gotten older that that some of even the hard rock has started to to bother me and it well uh the hard rock from your time from our time uh no no from this this new hard rock yeah yeah okay well okay i i i agree with you i don't have any trouble with you know uh uh with with with Zeppelin stuff i don't have any trouble with uh uh um-hum you you you you know stuff that that Santana or or or or Hendrix i don't have any trouble with that yeah me either but i have trouble with with this new crap uh well uh like i say well we've we've done nothing but but prove our age today yeah but it's fun to prove your age um i i get the biggest kick out of my i have uh two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old living at home and uh they well they hear one of these old remakes of a song and oh that's just a beautiful song and i'm like that's a remake they that that song's twenty years old yeah really oh no it just came out that's called music well then what you do is you go you know and you and and and you find the original and and and and you play it for them and luckily it it it it of course i i i was i been divorced but uh my my my my first wife has that first collection of of songs that that that you could probably prove them with you know well we've got uh four cases of albums downstairs and then we've got another case of oh i'm sure you probably have a lot of those then oh yes we do we've got some songs that will that will totally blow my children away um we've the problem we've been having is that we have a uh an old Fisher system and can't find a needle for it you know because they're not pressing oh yeah oh yeah oh wow i bet that really is a problem finding a stylus because turntables are yeah are going the way of the of the of of the horse and buggy yeah something yeah so i'm i'm hoping th at we can locate one soon and once i do locate a source i'm going to buy about twelve of them yeah i uh yeah i suggest you latch onto it you know uh i was just trying to think that uh i can suggest something to you you might look at are you familiar with Crutchfield um i've heard of it uh Crutchfield Electronics they also have a catalog and i've found i've got Beta machines and finding hi-fi beta tape has become almost impossible um-hum well i found that i can get it through them they have a lot of you know stuff that that that that um that you may be able to order through them so if you have access to a computer or anything like that you might get one on them of one of them like Comp U Serve i think Comp U Serve has Crutchfield so you can get on with them and and uh and you know and get one of their catalogs great i'll try that out i really uh i really do want to dig out the old LP's yeah if you if you if you have access to a computer and one of the information services uh i would suggest that that's the way you go yeah because i've i've got everything from uh God back when i've got all of Bill Cosby's original comedy albums you've got the real wow far out and i've even got Old Silver Throat that's the one album that he sang on oh really yeah he's horrible he horrible singer i listened to it one time that was it didn't know that he sang on any of it uh all right and i've i've got stuff listen it's been a pleasure i'm getting ready for Star Trek the Next Generation ah it's coming on in two minutes so i've enjoyed talking with you but i got to have my priorities all right yeah i know well it's been nice talking to you too all right take care all right you too bye-bye bye-bye  okay the recording started what kind of habits hobbies do you have okay i have two main hobbies one of them is painting and the other one is collecting wine but from your from the description it sounds like they're more interested in painting oh well i'm interested in wine i like the wine oh that's good that's fine i yeah yeah what kind of wines do you like well i'm a very big favor uh much in favor of red wines and i have about a thousand bottles down in my cellar and i've been collecting it now for oh fifteen years or so oh really my goodness red wines huh i'm a white wine drinker myself i i'm on the white Zinfandels now i i've come up the ladder the Chablis and the Rhines now i'm got uh on uh Zinfandels oh okay see white Zinfandels are not a big favorite of mine though really the whites i like are these very okay Chardonnays like Kessler Kessler and things like that uh-huh uh-huh you don't have any vineyards up there do you Meryl uh there are some but and in fact their white wines are better than their red wines because they don't get enough sun to make good red wine are there oh okay now see i'm from Grapevine that's uh used to be we have a winery here but uh it used to be uh i think they had a couple of wineries at one time but they do grow grapes here that's where they get the name Grapevine i'm originally from El Paso Texas and i have friend who has a vineyard actually it's in New Mexico near La Yunon New Mexico which is just north of El Paso up the valley oh are you uh-huh i understand i understand the University of Texas has a huge winery down in south Texas some place really big one but i don't know they're i guess they're bottling it i don't what they sell it under what name they sell it under have you ever visited the wineries in California yes some of them i uh i've uh gone to a couple my parents live in northern California so i visit there but back to hobbies i guess uh and what what kind of painting do you do oh mostly mostly figures i've few done landscapes my grandmother was an artist so when i was a little kid i was baby sat in her studio so i learned to mix paint by watching people mix paint things like that so uh-huh oh okay that's a good idea i used to paint uh you know i just dabble and i really think i have a talent for it but i've never really explored it like i should what little i have done i think is pretty good but as i said i never have gone on with it maybe i should have if i'd uh you know taken a lessons or something but i in through the years i've just i'm not any good any more when i was younger i i used to be pretty good oh for for years i used to go to groups that hire a model and draw once a week when i lived in New Jersey and used to work at Bell Labs and oh did you uh-huh i'd go twice a week for three hours and you do that for about ten years you get to where you can actually draw pretty well yes i would imagine i would hope so anyway well i when i was in high school i think i drew a mural behind the concession stand at the local theatre and you know stuff like that i won first prize painting the front of a bar Halloween night instead of kids soaping windows they wanted us to paint you know windows in town and i painted something won first prize on that but like i said i never did go on with it and uh oh i still paint occasionally not as much as i used to but i still paint i have some stuff set up the only two things in my basement are my painting stuff and the wine cellar which is wine we have wine cellars that's nice let me well i built it i you you have to way have some way of storing them so oh did you oh uh-huh well you know we don't have not many people have basements here for some reason i don't know why the the ground's it not wet like it is in Florida so i don't why they don't have basements you don't see too many of them yeah i think you probably don't get very good very good number of square feet for your dollar building a basement there that's probably why yeah i guess so guess so well i only hobbies i have is i jog and uh every night and that's just that and my yard work i love to i work in the yard i i have my yard work done but i do my flowers you know and stuff i i like to do stuff like that and i have quite a variety of flowers i work on that every all the time so you must have a lot well you ought to be seeing lots of flowers this time of year oh yeah they really are beautiful gorgeous time of the year because uh they're really out and especially roses roses do grow good down here i guess that's probably my best hobby and then i do volunteer work at a hospital that's kind of a hobby i guess i work in intensive care at a local hospital just um one night a week and that's kind of fun and different and kind of like a hobby i guess you find out what it's like in that kind of business yeah i've i'm amazed the people uh the different types of people i've met that the rude people the people that are so inconsiderate of other people and i it just boggles my mind how many i find like that that think they're the only ones that are grieving or having a hard time they don't have any respect for the people you know sitting across the room you know and they'll be laughing and carrying on and here are these people that are sad and i just i just can't get over people how people are i'm really getting getting a rude awakening to how the human nature is i guess you know and last last night i just there's big signs telling them not to go in without checking with the volunteer and you must be twelve years of age to go in and no more than two people at a time and so this man walks in you know just walks up without even checking with me with his seven year old daughter and his wife so that's three of them just you know there's three rules right there he busted you know just walked right on in and i thought golly you know he didn't even follow any of the rules and i and didn't even seem to bother of course they kicked him right out but and he probably didn't like that oh yeah very highly insulted you know how dare they but i just can't i just can't believe people i it this is the that's some place you need to work to really see how people really are when it comes right down to it anyway well working in a research place where i work at National Institute of Standards and Technology which used to be National Bureau of Standards that's kind of an ivory tower place so oh uh-huh yeah i know used to know a guy that uh from TI that was uh real big in standards uh James Tu that worked at uh TI and he was uh over the standards labs and everything i believe there and i was always impressed by all the clocks and you know the when we take things to be calibrated and what have you in the standards lab and it was kind of interesting that what you all do calibrate and yeah i yeah there's lots of stuff the only people i guess i know at TI are either the people who work in the speech program who run this this computer program or if the people in the semiconductor area i used to know Pallab Chatterjee and those kind of people i don't know don't know if you'd know him or not huh um-hum uh-huh no i had worked for TI for seventeen years but i uh quit about five years six years ago i guess and went with Mark Marietta and then came up here with another company and uh about two and a half years ago from Florida they're just back in the same area but i enjoy it here i'm a Texas person i'm not a native Texan but i love Texas so i wasn't happy till i got back well i grew up in Texas and i moved away and never came back so never came back huh oh well my all my family's in California i just i don't know i just couldn't stand being away from Texas i kept coming back and it feels good i i'm real happy here i like the weather and the people and i like the people in Florida too they were nice uh i enjoyed Florida but i like Texas better i guess but anyway i guess our five minutes is up i guess they are it's been nice talking to you it's been nice talking to you bye bye  well i guess uh the topic uh being favorite TV shows i uh i guess i could start by saying i'm just looking forward to uh watching the astronomers on PBS oh yes that and uh unfortunately they're having a like but they're having the uh a uh not telethon but a uh auction on on PBS here and oh uh-huh i'd noticed that in the in the TV Guide and i'd totally forgotten all about that um-hum and and it looks like it would be an a good series well the first uh episode started out pretty slow but after that it uh obviously has been preempted by the auction the last week or so so it uh i guess i'll never know but uh and you oh i i have a very wide range of uh uh different shows that i like uh um-hum uh it's i mean i mean even the what is it America's Funniest Videos there's just there's something about that i don't i don't know if it's the simplicity of it or just the total stupidity of it that is good yeah yeah yeah well it's it is enjoyable i'll give you that it's funny yeah and uh uh i i don't i don't get to watch TV that often or sit back and enjoy it i have a nine month old so that occupies a lot of the time but uh um-hum um-hum i would imagine about the only time i usually preempt for i think like Monday night we usually uh watch a lot of TV because that's when Murphy Brown and uh and Designing Women a lot of those shows are on we tend to watch always catch those yeah yeah those are good i like uh In the Heat of the Night and In the Heat of the Night yes that's uh that is Carroll O'Connor yeah uh yeah right uh that that's had some good episodes to it um-hum and then plus and then of course you have to have at least one soap opera well okay uh right i i i mean at least Knot's Landing or something on that order yeah well i guess i guess now that they've uh got rid of Dallas which we uh we tend to watch religiously here at uh at at least we're getting ready for the big final episode right right i've been uh i tend to i try to catch that every now and then and i mean you still catch up with it you know every couple of weeks yeah i it's it's funny how they're uh now that the show's over they're kind of trying to complete all of these uh stories um-hum in a very short period of time so it's like you turn on about eighty seven things happen in an episode now right yeah i been trying to catch it the last few weeks so i can see how it ends and uh um-hum i guess uh the only rumor i've heard that they had in the papers so far is that uh the last episode is supposed to be like uh it's a wonderful life for JR oh no so it's uh what what would life had been like if he would had not been born there something like that so uh it's should be interesting right lots of tongue in cheek it's going to be funny i bet something something tells me Larry Hagman's going to milk this role that uh all it's worth right he's uh uh with him producing it it it he hasn't done a bad job but uh no no not at all not at all that's uh that's true but we uh sort of get a kick out of the Simpsons oh do you i i very rarely unfortunately it it comes on a little early here and i sometimes i'm usually at work but they moved it to Thursdays and i guess that's what uh but uh yeah the the few times that i've been able to see it it's uh at first i didn't think so uh-huh and when i first saw it i i haven't been able to see it very often but when i first saw it i said well well this looks like it's it's going to you know go over like a lead balloon it uh doesn't look like it's going to be good at all right but the few times i've seen it i guess it's something that grows on you it it definitely grows on you and you think that it's yeah so far fetched you know with the normal family life that uh but um-hum every now and then they'll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing um-hum the the big thing i always hear about is i guess at the beginning they always open it a little differently where they all run to the sofa yeah right and uh the things that uh Bart will write on the uh chalk board at school yeah that's it and then sometimes you know the it's like one episode i guess the sofa wasn't even there and they all just stood there and looked at each other and and stuff like that so so i hear a lot about that right and uh it's almost it's almost up there with uh Saturday Night Live i guess is the big now with that is the the guy with uh you know like Steve uh Steve Meister and and it's like wherever i go anymore i've uh i get got a chance not only to to visit a few companies and all that around here and uh yeah it's like you walk into a lobbies of those places it's like you know Ralph Ralph Meister Ralphster and uh it's uh right we do that a lot at work yep so it's like that's something that's really really taken off but uh right uh yeah there there're a lot of things come off of Saturday Night Live that uh um-hum get caught up into the normal everyday routine right right because uh isn't that special i guess is the last one with uh with the church lady but uh yeah right and uh oh what was the one that Gilda Radner did oh uh uh it's always not it's always something but uh oh and and i'm i'm and i'm real good at it too well well no it's not in that special that uh well anyway but you know what i'm saying there's you know things will get picked up from it and uh when she oh what was that yeah uh-huh um-hum get caught in the regular conversation anymore right and uh right oh yeah well TV's on constantly here whenever we're at home well especially if you have a nine month that nine month old that probably how about uh have you watched the the what's that new show Baby Talk or or the one with where they take off of Who's Talking uh i've seen one of i've seen one part of an episode yeah i haven't seen any of it yet but was it was it any good it didn't do anything for me i uh uh we like Look Who's Talking you know and this just wasn't anything to me like it yeah um-hum you know with uh wasn't it Bruce Willis that did the voice but uh you know there's just something with that yeah um-hum i guess we're also looking forward to the uh boy it's it's terrible that i guess we watch so much television but uh i guess the one other thing we're watching for i guess LA Law has uh last couple couple episodes coming up here yes right i've been catching that that's been real interesting and uh that was that was so wild when they when they got rid of uh the one uh actress uh Dey yes the one that fell down the yes a an elevator shaft that was that was pretty it's like we we were all i was like wait i missed that rewind rewind rewind here yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened i'd say if you if if you if you weren't watching it was like boom you missed it and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened right right uh so it uh and now with uh all the lawyers you know rising in arms and going off to join uh Michael i guess whoever uh um-hum it looks like it's gonna the last few episodes are going to be good yeah yeah matter of fact uh i guess that's going to be the same same same uh what Dallas and uh LA Law and a lot of these are really uh i guess are really going for a lot of cliffhangers this year right and well and LA Law is getting rid of several of their characters and they keep uh that's what i heard i guess uh like like Susan Dey and a few of them are up for contract renewal and they didn't do it or something like that yeah uh see i heard that uh they wanted to keep it fresh and did not have the same ones there forever and so they would be bringing in new ones or whatever yeah yeah because i it it's pretty obvious though like Corbin Benson is probably not going to be there long because he's been starring in these uh miniseries and and his part's gotten smaller and smaller and they're bringing on the uh like the British uh lawyer who uh uh-huh yeah i guess her and and the blonde uh district attorney or went went to teach that seminar to the Russian uh Russian lawyers at the uh yes oh yeah uh at the swimming pool at the swimming pool there in Palm Springs and uh you can see they're really starting to build up their characters and they've they've kind of really down played like uh Corbin Benson and uh few of those uh the top ones Harry Hamlin a lot of them yeah see i think yeah and those i know that those three were supposed to leave and i don't remember about uh okay oh what is it uh Sprinchez um-hum i don't know if i don't know if he's supposed to leave either or not oh really huh but uh are you out on the west coast uh no i'm in the uh where i'm in Texas oh you're in Texas okay yeah um-hum uh you mentioned the time and i was i uh the time frame and i got confused there oh with the Simpsons and all that yeah um-hum yeah because i i because i guess it's on at seven o'clock on on Thursdays yeah and sometimes i don't uh don't usually make it that on on that late in the week right on Thursdays yeah usually by then i'm working a little later and later it seems and uh and never get home to watch it but uh it was better when it was on Saturday i couldn't uh didn't have an excuse then but uh oh well yeah well i guess uh guess we've run out of TV shows haven't we right we've we've covered a lot of them i guess uh you show it shows we you too Michelle you have a good evening bye-bye well i enjoyed talking to you you too bye-bye  okay okay uh the question was about uh physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise well uh i i don't do it as much as i should i try to walk um-hum um-hum and uh last year i would i did it every day but i've kind of in ninety one i've kind of gone down hill um-hum and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to but i i can tell you when i do do it on a regular basis i feel so much better and so much healthier i agree but it's just to get motivated to do it and once i get started and and i i i can i do it every night it's just to get uh motivated motivated again and uh-huh what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again and um i was walking and it got kind of dark and i was by myself and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block um-hum ooh and so i i kind of got frightened and i kind of use that as an excuse All i have to do is start earlier but i haven't walked since so right it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise i know what you mean it sure is it sure is it sure is how about you do you exercise on a regular basis um well i try to um i started at the beginning of this year i decided all right i'm going to start exercising again i'm going to be real good and i went through the TI fitness center and registered for the uh aerobics classes there uh-huh and they run for two months at a time and you have to you do have to pay to take them and i took i signed up for one that was three nights a week an hour and a half so that was four and a half hours a week oh and it cost sixty dollars and i thought okay that's not cheap that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money and i had a friend of mine going so i was real good i only missed it about three times right and then oh March came around and i signed up again and i got uh caught up with a class i was taking at TI and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class and uh-huh then i went to Colorado Springs the next week to do some training at the TI up there and so that was two weeks i had missed and boy i tell you what i've been terrible ever since then yeah it's once you get out of that habit you just don't you don't get back into it because i teach school and um-hum last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class we went in together and hired a private instructor and she came to our school twice a week uh-huh and i i was i would go faithfully and then i missed once then i went back again a couple times and missed another time and then kept missing and never went back again i think if you you just have to stick with it um-hum oh yeah i think i've been two maybe three times the month of April and this session is about to run out now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real a busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes and some of them require me to go out of town and and uh that just kind of throws my whole schedule off when am doing that so uh-huh yeah and i've lately yeah there's been nights that i could have gone and i've found excuses uh things like i i had the flu last week but i'm fine this week i could have gone Monday i could have gone tonight and i didn't so i'm kind of yeah yeah kind of finding excuses and now it's kind of like well this is the last week i'll just start fresh next week but i better do better do it and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months she started taking tennis lessons and so i haven't had that extra motivation of of us forcing each other or not forcing each other but encouraging each other to go so yeah sure yeah that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing like it's misery loves company i don't really love exercise i mean some i the neighbor across the street she goes belongs to President's and um-hum uh it's not President's any more i don't know what the name of it is anymore but uh she loves it i mean she it's just it's an automatic high for her she just enjoys it so much and i don't um-hum um-hum yeah i'm the same way i'm i feel good after i do it but i hate it when i'm doing it you know i just i don't enjoy it at all and she just loves it so yeah it even when she doesn't go to the health club she runs you know and it's a daily thing for her so it you know and it's so hard for me i envy her i wish i could be that way but i don't um-hum um-hum i do too i don't and i have an older sister that loves running too and she runs all the time but at to me it's every minute's agony and i in fact i don't run i hate to run like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something and that helps you know pass the time uh-huh right yeah walking is kind of boring i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood and we try to we used to try to get together and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex uh-huh uh-huh and it's not as boring if you get several people and you can kind of talk and that's right and it it makes it pass pretty quickly and the aerobics isn't too boring i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it um it's it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do i guess but uh i do i do have to make myself go and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good and after i get finished i feel great yeah yeah oh it's great afterwards yeah i mean i can go in there i can be like a Friday afternoon when i'm tired it's the end of the week and i just want to go home and i'll make myself go and i'll have headache and everything and i get out i don't have a headache any more i feel great and i'm just it's amazing how much better i feel and then just in general i sleep a lot better and i just feel much better i mean i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks and i know if i would just get around to exercising yeah yeah that's right exactly it does it gives you energy i'd feel feel better but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising well i'm too tired or i have a headache or well i just got over the flu and i'm still kind of draggy so i better not go yeah it's kind of a vicious circle isn't it yeah i find too that i have more energy when i exercise and i and uh you know it's silly not to but i don't know yeah it really is it's just a put off i don't know why i don't do more and i and i know that it's good for my health i know you know from everything that you read and you see on television now exercise is so important to good health right so you know you not only you know you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit but you're probably prolonging your life so there's no reason that we shouldn't do it but i don't know right it's just hard to make yourself go and i i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night and i've been sweaty and and it you know i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands so it kind of kills the yeah yeah the evening for doing errands so i think a Tuesday Thursday might be a little bit better of course i feel like once i've done it if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty more minutes because you've already kind of shot your night but that's yeah right but um so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on Tuesday Thursday now that i can just kill two nights and and uh get a reasonable amount of workout in so yeah does it cost the same for just two nights or no it's less expensive this one was only forty five dollars but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap because if it was too c heap i would talk myself out of going more probably well that's good too sure yeah yeah since it's more expensive i think okay you spent that much money you'd better go that's right that's right well do you have a facility right at the where you work so hopefully yeah yeah it's right there and it's they have a really nice facility at the TI they've got two different aerobics rooms they have the mirrors of course sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but no yeah and then they hire private instructors they have oh that's great uh-huh and they have ceiling fans in the rooms and it's it's a pretty nice setup um and of course it's real convenient because it is right there at work i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere i'd never make it yeah and just the fact that i can just go straight from my desk over to the the recreation center and do it helps a lot uh-huh yeah i can see that would be uh easy they make it as easy as they possibly can for you oh yeah well um do a lot of people take advantage of it quite a few do they have probably ooh i'd say fifteen different fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running and they have them anywhere from six in the morning uh they have some during during lunch hour that are shorter and i guess guys can take advantage of that for me i wouldn't have time to do an hour hour of aerobics and then take a shower and get get dressed again but there's a lot more guys that do that one and um oh yeah uh-huh they have them you know in the in the evenings they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that so they have big variety they even have some uh aerobic uh water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool i've never done that one before but oh you have a pool there too oh how nice uh-huh they've got an olympic pool and and basketball courts and sand volleyball they've got the full weight room and uh the locker rooms with uh a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities and hair dryers and all the you know everything you'd need just about wow it's a real it is a real nice facility it's also got a full inside inside basketball court and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things but it's it is very nice that's great i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should i mean i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing but now to use well does it cost money like to use the to exercise in the weight room or to uh to take to go swimming do you have to pay for that too yeah well you can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities and it's about eight dollars a month oh that's not bad huh-uh no not at all pretty cheap um so and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership but i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced from what i've heard i think so too yeah yeah well and and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics hm people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics oh yeah in fact uh the T TIer's families can can come in on these things  are you are you a TIer Carla yeah i am oh and you work in the Sherman plant uh whereabouts uh-huh uh in the front end the wafer fab oh okay good deal oh i'm in Dallas i'm in uh in SC group QRA i i'm kind of a worldwide quality manager based here in Dallas uh mostly the offshore assembly sites where do you work uh-huh oh great oh wow except i'm fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today you going to Motorola no i'm going to Onum oh uh it's a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but it's been thirty two years so i mean i've i've served i've done my time oh oh yeah okay you ready to talk about taxes okay oh yeah were you happy with your return this year were you happy with your tax return this year huh what did you say no no was it negative okay i guess we're on the air now okay uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh what's your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items um-hum um-hum and um i don't know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal what what state are you from Carla Indiana Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax right yeah though it's a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing right okay because there's a lot of tax breaks for like you know a lot of things if you're involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that they'll break you for oh i see okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it um not even sure because i was a student so i didn't pay that much oh okay okay but uh because as as you know where uh there's there's uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas right and what percent would that be yeah uh i have no idea i i i uh i'm i'm originally from Massachusetts but they didn't have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is uh-huh uh-huh but you know getting to the back getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff uh-huh uh-huh uh i don't believe it it's worse i know well you can't deduct for credit card interest that type of thing oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and yeah the only thing that's left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically yeah right right and would then and and that's significant and every once in a while they make noises like they're going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did oh yeah and and uh one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in Malaysia for TI and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because i'll i'll have a lot of equity in my house uh-huh then when my children are old enough to go to college i'll get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so i'll be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part oh wow guess what what happened that that's not legal in Texas it's the only state in the country that it's not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas oh my gosh and and so i i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that i've got almost paid off and have all kinds of equity in it and don't have and you know struggling to keep i've got two children in college and i'm going to have three by September oh man but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because i've heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal uh-huh so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year oh yeah and and i'm not exactly sure what what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i don't know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four uh-huh Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes uh-huh and now we're paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with fifty cents it's incredible and it is it is absolutely incredible and and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible uh uh is you know do you have children in school no i don't i just got married i don't have any children oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas how long you been in Texas three years oh okay well you'll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state that's got a very decent public school system and you'll find out that in Texas we've got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states uh-huh yeah and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldn't have so much money going to so many different schools yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the we've got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is they've got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching yeah than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas yeah i've heard that uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything really and and and they've got uh i don't know what the ratio is but they've got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching and it is sor t of like we do at TI sounds like TI is was getting ready to yeah yeah we get we get fat in those areas and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got yeah and then all your money goes to overhead uh-huh uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i don't know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that aren't going allow first first of all they're not college prep courses and i don't think they're going help a person make a living they're just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate right yeah and and and all that and so i'm not i'm not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isn't it right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman and yeah i i think right here in Dallas we're paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts i've been here thirty two years but they used to call it Taxachusetts and uh i was there on business last weekend oh really and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent oh wow and i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesn't cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents uh-huh oh really for it and and i notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents i think so so the little items you pay what the price tag says well now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax i don't know i i don't i bet they're not i i'll absolutely bet they're not it it's interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because i've only heard of it in bits and pieces but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes oh man they were going to they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadn't uh uh i haven't heard that i haven't heard that much about it uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana think it was like five and a half percent uh-huh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana Indiana University yeah Purdue no Purdue oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were we're tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year uh-huh oh yeah yeah oh great oh and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue so we're aware uh that they've that they've got a very good program there yeah they well it's just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but yeah yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the play-off this year yeah they yeah they've been exciting to watch yeah and uh that's an what did you get get your degree in supervision okay supervision supervision that's an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail yeah lot of theory um it's pretty it's pretty broad uh-huh uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing are you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses yeah yeah the The Boss Course yeah the Boss Course yeah that was a really good course yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of  okay the topic was uh should the United States adopt the metric system and if so should uh oh how should they do it why didn't it work last time and why didn't it work last time well yeah well i'm well i'm all for it i i am too i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the the problem because we're so wound up in the in the system that we've got that you know trying to convert over yeah and i guess what'd they try they tried what'd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard and you give it some sort of a weird yeah they tried to metric number like uh six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter something like that yeah yeah direct conversion yeah and uh i i don't know uh i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way yeah well don't most of them doesn't just about everything now have uh both but if you start uh metric and English they do but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages you know you buy a quart of milk and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there but it still a quart so if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and oh yeah yeah um-hum you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units that's how you're going to think of it yeah i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was Exxon figures we we were living in uh Lubbock at the time they started marketing it in in liters and it was only like you know twenty nine and thirty cents a liter so they could put this sign out front that said you know thirty nine cents a liter and nobody had any idea what a liter was so right uh yeah that's that's the problem when you finally figured out that liters what about a quart there's about four liters in a gallon you know so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it right it's kind of hard for me to believe that this this day and age i don't know when i was growing up we were taught the metric system in school i mean not not at first but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway um-hum yeah oh i've never it's i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age of or you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway a liter's about a quart yeah i yeah the uh i think maybe there's where the the problem came in you know we uh tried to instead of learning it's kind of like learning a language you know when you learn one from the other yeah you always end up in this conversion thing all the time so it's you it's almost like uh course this country isn't a dictatorship but you know it's like somebody said okay as of such and such a date yeah you know anybody caught talking in the English metric you know in the will be shot or something like that you know but uh uh well thing is it's a global global market place these days and you know we're one of like what two backwards clo countries in the world as far as yeah i read that what Uganda and uh uh something i don't remember what the other one is but uh there's one or two others that just it's it's just time i think for for us to go over because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international um-hum i don't you know i don't know i uh i work for TI we're all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway yeah well i i yeah i i do too and uh one of the things that we've run run into a a problem of course you're familiar with the TI drawing well with any drawing system you end up with uh you end up with things in inches and right mils and microns right in parts of inches you know fourth half fourth you know this sort of thing and then you end up with a decimal right where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing and then some of them are are done in uh you know purely metric right yeah i remember how big stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in mils and it um-hum um-hum and it got to you know somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but uh you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs yeah oh i can imagine and so the uh the one that uh uh have you ever lived in a country where they use metric no or i was with TI in in El Salvador for a while no and uh i had to get used to you know purely metric system down there and because they they didn't understand anything else you know if you start talking about miles they'd look at you like what you know yeah so uh i had a little bit of experience with it and also i noticed in Canada they uh you drop a a quarter fifty cents whatever in a Coke machine up there and you get this funny looking Coke you know it's in a can that's uh that's taller but not as big around you know i guess that's some yeah about a half a liter or something it's not it's not a liter it's like a half a liter or something like that it's a strange looking can yeah but my daughter-in-law's from Panama and she has they have uh had Americans down there for so long you know that they're they're kind of into both systems but uh she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing is the the Centigrade for which she says Celsius yeah i would have more problem with more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering we do everything in Centigrade or Celsius well i had kind of gotten used to uh centigrade temperature you know if it's between zero and ten it's cold and if it's between ten and twenty it's not too bad if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm and if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out so yeah getting warm right but uh the big problem is not having the uh uh the resolution between temperature you know between a hundred and if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is you know you you don't get all the little yeah well it's about the differences you know the differences between seventy and seventy two or seventy five degrees isn't much but the difference between thirty and thirty five degrees is is quite a bit yeah yeah it's about twice as much yeah what it works out to yeah five well i one point one point eight times as many yeah something like that yeah points yeah so i don't know i think as long as people have a choice they're going to stick with the American way i um-hum and until we have to have to learn to think that way we we won't yeah i know we keep calling it the English system but i'm i'm not sure what they do in England now they're they're on metric aren't they yeah for the most part i think so yeah except they've got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh they've got a a nut and bolts system called Wentworth and uh this thing was was even different than you know SAE standards and stuff so right uh uh this this came okay my my dad bought uh one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years back you know quite a few years back and the thing had uh uh an Austin Heeley type uh engine you know it was Austin motors engine and running gear right and the body was built by Nash or who you know American it wasn't that was even before American Motors but Nash essentially in the US somewhere and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and uh SAE he ended up with about three sets of tools in order to work on that fool thing because uh he just get one more i think the Wentworth and the SAE bolt sizes were the same but the threads were different and uh it was it was it was a it was a total mess oh that would be a mess and i know on my Chevy van that's a couple of years old uh part of it's built in Canada matter of fact the thing is i always say it's built off shore you know because it was assembled in Canada the only thing that was in it was built in the US was the uh differential and it was built in Buffalo New York but it's got the darndest combination of uh of metric and most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so it's well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them up because you're never going to get to one one system if you still still got a got a mix it's just crazy yeah um-hum and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole whole nine yards um-hum yeah it's kind of hard to do gradually i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty six or fifty seven's a hundred yeah uh uh or a hundred kilometers and uh you know a hundred a hundred yeah you'd have a hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five but you'd have people going you're right a hundred miles an hour yeah oh hell you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour yeah and so i don't know i'd kind of and the other thing too is you know between here and El Paso's what five hundred miles but it's it's almost eight hundred kilometers you know that'd sure seems like a long way yeah but they'd need they'd seem to be ticking off faster too yeah i guess that's it every road sign you come to is like well i didn't know i went that far i don't know well they converted all the road signs to fifty five miles an hour you know they could of converted it to metric just about as easy yeah i think they you got the problem with all your cars are still yeah you still got cars on the road that don't have both yeah at that time anyway the that was still when things were the metric system was still not yeah not all that common yeah you know now cars they have both yeah sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way i was yeah i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in Panama where's a lot of the road signs and everything are in uh in miles per hour and some are in uh in kilometers and you you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any yeah  so tell me about Silence of the Lambs is it great i liked it i really did actually i saw it twice my roommate ex-roommate and i were real into psychological things we we think people with mind problems are really interesting so i mean you know real psychotic people so we were dying to see it so we went and saw it and i had to see it the second time to get it all because i kept my eyes closed through so much of the first part right is it really that scary well it's it's not that it's that scary it's that it's so graphic because uh how well are you going to see it i don't want to tell you how it ends i i i uh i plan on probably renting it at some point in my life okay so some time later much later huh yeah i've got small children i don't get out to many movies okay well it's uh what is so weird about it is that it it's a real it's based on real people um-hum and i read the story in People magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and they're a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life and so a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you it really does happen in real life you know normally normally in movies you can look at it and say well it's a movie and that doesn't really happen it's only pretend right right but in this you're going i i would have done that i can see where that would happen oh and it's it gets really scary but it's it's a real interesting movie very thought provoking there are so many things to discuss when the movie's over if you're one of those people that likes to discuss things and and think about why it happened uh-huh i i still talk about it with we'll call each other every now and then and go remember when in the movie this happened well i was just reading today and and things just keep relating back to it i thought it was fascinating wow maybe i should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner afterwards so we could sit and talk about it i don't know if you want to go to dinner maybe just go out for a soda or something i don't think you want to eat it it is real good though it's it's uh i liked it i liked Dances with Wolves too though that was a real good movie oh yeah that's one of the best films i've seen in a long time yeah i didn't think i'd like it i don't normally like the uh the old West type movies things like that the they don't normally interest me but that one i really really liked because it it i didn't know so much about the Indians and all that that happened in that part of the war um-hum i had never heard anything really about that before and this was a whole new idea to me anyway i thought it was real good what what's your heritage um i'm about a quarter Italian and my grandmother on my mother's side is a little bit of everything oh typical American little bit of Indian little bit of this little bit of that and that's about it yeah i've i've got quite a bit of Indian blood in me so what do you some of it was um things that i had heard well both of i had two great grandparents that were full blood oh really and but they were on opposite sides which which one were they Sioux Indians or what were they no one was uh Blackfoot and one was Cherokee oh neat and um so i knew a lot about just um oh the kind of respect they had for the earth right that it was real it wasn't something i'd just read in books it was something i was taught right and um and so you know like the the scene with the buffalo uh-huh oh i cried that was horrible that was awesome oh i did too i did too i i just i mean it you know it that because i know it happened over and over and over again yeah and i mean it's just like we're raping our land now but um-hum um you know it was i i just thought that was one of the movies best movies i've seen in so long because it made me laugh i mean i was you know parts of it i was just almost in the aisles laughing over it and it makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are people who have no ethnic background no heritage anything other than just typical Americans a little bit of everything and they don't really know um-hum they don't know anything about the Indian people they don't know anything about the Europeans that came over um-hum you know it it really made it seem like we are so in the dark on so many things um-hum yeah i think that it yeah tried to make people realize that um we can't close our mind to another culture simply because it's not ours right exactly and uh and it was so there was so much the Indians did teach us and there was so much more they could have taught us had we only listened uh-huh and i still really other than just basic ignorance of prejudice i don't understand why we didn't why them why did we not listen to them i've never they had something we wanted we wanted yeah well yeah but isn't isn't it sad to think that that much that greed can do that much to you or to a person i mean they we wanted the land and we didn't want them to have it so just screw everything they're going to think and teach us and tell us and and we could just like wipe out an entire people like that yeah that's that's sad well i i think of the uh you know the the gang wars and the racial wars that we have now in so many of our cities and in our high schools right that are basically the same thing acted out by a younger generation over uh-huh uh you know they're fighting over things that are to them are important enough to possibly die for right and yet they just don't matter right and you know i mean it comes down to that the land or the the territory or the you know the bathroom or whatever is there for everyone right right and it can be enjoyed by all if shared right i mean but but that's what we did to the Indians we said you know we're afraid of you you don't you don't look like we do you don't talk like we do so we're going to move you out right and and we offered reservations as you know consolation prize and they were a joke right right that is that's a good way to look at it a consolation prize that's about all it was yeah yeah they that's really sad that things like that can still happen today after all this time yeah you would think we'd a learned something by now yeah but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win yeah that's true he with the most toys i guess that's right hey all that counts in Monopoly is who has Boardwalk and Pork Park Place that's right who's got more hotel i really did like Silence of the Lambs though that was really an interesting movie i i liked Dances with Wolves but it was a more an emotional like you get real involved and you cried and you feel real sorry for the people you know and all this but in Silence of the Lambs it was kind of that Fatal Attraction did you see that um-hum yeah it was kind of that feeling through the whole thing on the edge of your seat wanting to tell the people what to do next you know you're like no don't go in there don't give him your name you you just you start acting it out for them yeah i definitely ought to get in on a rental then because people would look at me in the theatre going what is this woman doing no believe it or not the whole theatre got involved i mean yes in fact i'm trying to i can't remember which scene it was but at one point everyone in the theatre clapped really they were so happy it was it was and i thought i was just there and i heard other people crying when i was crying man there were certain parts in there that were real sad and you hear people when you know the the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap some bad thing and everyone in the theatre will go and you know everybody does it it's like the whole theatre you get this big sound and it was i i think everybody felt that way through it it was very real involved and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it did goodness i yeah this is going to roll right off my side right i remember the first time i saw it was with my boyfriend and he was joking with me about how i wasn't going to watch half of it i was going to close my eyes and there were quite a few scenes where i did but this one scene i knew something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked my head and about that time i heard the audience go and my boyfriend jumped he literally jumped and he swears he didn't do it and i felt him jump oh that's great and it really was to this day i tell him he was scared and he says no no you you just didn't watch it you should have watched it it wasn't that bad i'm like yeah right that's why you jumped i'm going to have a hard time waiting for it to come out on video now yeah really it is a great movie you got to see it yeah it's so fascinating to think that there are people that are so so smart they're such geniuses that they've cross that line and they're they're psychotic and it's amazing um-hum yeah it's very scary it really is i mean to think that it could be anybody we know i mean you could be walking right next to one of them and not even know it because they look perfectly normal i mean this man was a doctor um-hum um-hum and he had patients in fact they were the people he killed you know and you think right now your doctor could be wacko he could be some psychotic killer and no one would ever know yeah it's just strange but that that was what was that was what made the movie because it's so real i like movies that are based on on things that are real yeah yeah i do too oh yeah oh what was it um the ones about um Von Bulows oh what was that um oh the something about Portuguese  there we go okay music yeah um i like um a lot of different things so um i'm into got a big record collection and uh uh mostly mostly rock but i got some folk and some jazz yeah so do i i have everything from Frank Sinatra to the Sex Pistols yeah okay that's uh so that that covers a pretty wide range right there it's a pretty weird thing i was pretty bummed when they had CD's come out though yeah hum well yeah i mean you can get CD's of the Sex Pistols which um i think kind of defeats i mean somebody's missing the point right well i've got four hundred and fifty records and it's like oh well i have um i know i don't know what the exact count is but i know it's like eight hundred to nine hundred wow albums and um yeah i i got a CD player about four or five years ago and i've been buying CD's but um you know i'm not trying to i'm not trying to go LP to CD because well for a couple of reasons one is i can't afford it and um the other is some of the stuff that um i've got a and i'll never find on CD it'll never be reissued right yeah no and and and there's a bunch of stuff that i really really don't care if i have it on CD right right i've got a pretty good David Bowie collection oh you're you're a big Bowie fan or uh yeah used to be i mean i i still like him a lot but he's he's gotten so kind of weird i mean in that he was truly weird before and now he's just kind of middle of the road yeah i was just kind of well styles change and you get it's like oh Dave Bowie's not weird anymore i'll get uh right oh he he yeah he's marrying that model and i don't know that Iman the black model she's about twenty two years old he married a model i didn't know that i think they're supposed to get married i know he's been everywhere with her hum i haven't been i been uh i got to pay attention hum staying up with People magazine you haven't been staying up with People magazine no man you know just got the new issue of Rolling Stone and they didn't mention it so uh every so often he's on the society society page as it were with a picture of her it seems so odd to me that David Bowie is showing up in People magazine it's just like wait a minute i mean you know it's like oh it yeah it's wrong okay you know New Kids On the Block all right these are you know these aren't serious people anyway but Bowie right right yeah i mean i'm not i'm not a huge Bowie fan but i like his music actually the the coolest Bowie thing that one one one one of the coolest things i have happens to be a Bowie item it's a um um it's a picture disk with uh of him and Bing Crosby doing Peace on Earth uh Little Drummer Boy and you know you can get this as a forty five but this is like a twelve inch with um the um the label is instead of being a real label is a picture of him and Bing from the uh from the Christmas special that it was from how funny it's it's a trip um oh that's great yeah you can get uh you know if you can get actually buy the forty five it's usually out around Christmas time because it's it's it's a really neat song actually and they do they do a good duet um but it's it's always the thing that's like oh you know you know when i got people over and we're trying to you know you know uh you know weirding people out on music that one usually gets them one up yeah um i got i've got like bootlegs of his concerts and stuff which i kind of treasure and hum his old records and stuff and i remember when i was in high school you combing record stores anytime i could get the chance uh for something of his and now it all seems for not you know you can get his old stuff on CD um-hum yeah uh it's like what were all those hours those little treasures i have but i have originals you know um-hum well i know the feeling when i've gone um and just knocked myself out um i'm a big Who fan that's uh-huh and i've gone and knocked myself out sometimes finding old Who forty fives with like these B sides that never got put on an album you know and i was knocking myself you know i found these a bunch of them you know didn't spend a whole lot of money on them um oh right but uh finding them was the the effort yeah i've yeah it was a big thing well i got i have a friend who's like the forty five king of the world he has something along the lines of fifteen thousand forty fives he has every top forty single since he was born nineteen you know like nineteen sixty four and i think every top twenty single going back to around fifty five i think he's cut it out lately because most most of the stuff wow you know he can only get as cassette single and he you know we both despise cassette singles um but he's found some of the Who stuff for me and you know we went you know all all this trouble to find this and then they released a couple Who rarity albums that had like half the stuff on it it's like great oh you know and then the one other i think the one other Who thing he located for me was um uh i don't know if you're familiar with the Who they they have a song called Substitute doesn't ring a bell it sounds familiar but i can't no i like the Who i've got some Who oh okay okay anyway um there was a um a single of Substitute out and Substitute yeah Substitute yeah i know that song yeah okay yeah okay now you know what i'm talking about yeah um anyway it came out in the mid sixties in in this country on a weird record on a record label that they aren't normally on so it was cool they find it for that but the B side was something called Waltz for a Pig which wasn't on any record and it wasn't on the rarity records so this was a big deal and then um you know once once Steve found it for me and everything i i happened to go and and look back at some like Who biographies i have and uh i discovered that the B side isn't actually by the Who it's b y what's called the Who Orchestra because there was some like legal thing that said the Who couldn't record and so it was actually by the by a band called the Grand Bond Organization so it's like gee all this trouble and it's not even the Who oh well it's a fun thing to have anyway yeah something how funny yeah it's but it turns out that um uh you know listening to the the version of Substitute on the single it's actually different than than um the one that was normally in the US because um uh there was some lyrics they found objectionable i think the one uh i look all white but my dad was black um the American record companies said nah you know you can't release this so they it has a different lyric on it so that's kind of neat yeah yeah it's worth it i guess for the for the people that really like it but yeah well yeah um you know i have um you know like you were saying you know i've got i have a lot a lot of bootlegs and stuff by the Who and uh by Pete Townsend and uh some of the really fun stuff with Townsend is um um-hum one one of the demos i have is called Obscure and Oblique and it's it's a bunch of demos and i you know i'm really curious actually how they got their hands on this stuff but um it's really cool listening to the stuff because um you hear things that are different than the way the Who actually recorded the song or or he recorded the song solo cool yeah and it's just kind of interesting to see his um you know how he works up to the final product yeah there's um he's also put out a couple albums called Scoop Scoop and Another Scoop which um are collections of demos so i have like three collections of demos of his and there's a couple songs in the collections that are the same almost the same as songs the Who did on their last album but aren't so that's that's really cool i mean there's this one song called Popular that became the song It's Hard with um a different verse oh yeah how fun oh that's great oh you do fifteen thousand singles oh i can't i have like uh so yeah twenty five and i think i'm doing real well but a lot of those are real precious to me you know like Vanilla Cherry Vanilla you know the which was a i i have all of these like uh well yeah the Bowie genealogy you know if if if i read somewhere in you know Circus magazine in nineteen seventy two that David Bowie knew so and so well i had this get you know i bought a Mot the Hoople album i didn't even know who Mot the Hoople was um-hum oh but you got a good one though but i knew that David Bowie produced it right so if David Bowie wrote a song and somebody did it i ran bought i bought the album you know yeah i'm like that a lot with the Who i've got i i counted it up sometime and i have like twelve versions of Pinball Wizard by you know either by the Who or it's a demo or it's a live version by the Who and then there's like the Elton John version and then um wow right i guess the the the weirdest ones i have are ones by the New Seekers you know the guys that did I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing and uh the other one is uh Rod Stewart of all people Rod yeah you know you know i was listening to that song the other day now you you you would know this you of all people would know this i was like i have listened to that song a million times okay and we had just gone to church and then we were like listening to it and i went um-hum you know this is a really Christian song Harry to my husband and he was like no i think it's you're just weird but have you ever i mean i i know that's kind of a strange thing to say but uh do you see like those those overtones i mean couldn't that be like a gospel song you're going to go listen to it and go this girl's really weird but i mean it's like i don't know it's it's hard for me to listen listen to it in true light anymore since i've heard it so many times um i mean i can't i mean i want to throw up usually when i hear it anymore i um i but i was listening to it and it was like you know the guy was like blind i don't i can't even uh think of what now and i kept saying no no you know listen it it works well the the problem with the problem with Pinball Wizard is that it's you you hear it on the radio and it's completely out of context with because it it it's part of a larger work right and um so i don't know i mean i don't i don't want to disagree with you i i i i don't know how many  start what kind of recycling programs do you have in Rowlett um the well right now they've got a kind of a central location off of the main highway and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper um plastic um i think three bins for glass white green and whatever whatever other combination there is and and i think they've got a comp uh some kind of container for aluminum Plano's doing real good on that they have uh they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans uh-huh which we're supposed to put all our week's garbage into it and of course it doesn't fit right now but now we start in May breaking it down and they're picking it all up yeah um so they're going to by and we have to separate our papers and our glass and then uh they have one day for like um oh everything you picked up from your yard and we put that in disposable bags and they pick that up on Monday uh-huh um so it's really great i i'm really going head you know completely for it i think it's marvelous well that's good well Rowlett had sent sent out a survey not too long ago um in terms in how many people were interested in having a a pick up i guess on the days they do trash or something like that And apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably favorably because they're going to do it i don't know how how soon they're going to do it or how organized it's going to be but they're they're supposed to initiate that some sometime in the next couple of months well does your uh where you work do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that um i've never noticed that we don't have a a whole lot because we're in a hospital setting so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria um well down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your you know pop cans and things like that um no there's there's only one pop machine and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now so uh mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea so you don't have much choice there no not not really well i work at uh JC Penny and last week they brought they have a sign up that says for one full week uh-huh you bring in your old wire hangers and they are going to recycle them um so it's getting people clean out their closets and such and then like the week before that they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good bring it in and they brought it down to the shelters uh-huh and they have one two they have three i think that i know of for cans for people have pop and they put them right near where they have the time cards and it works great and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too um-hum yeah that's good so they're really going at it and i think it's marvelous because yeah i i guess Rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about well and i think they're trying to to make some changes i i noticed at the library or someplace this past uh month month and a half ago they were having a speaker um talk about doing lawn work and how how important it is to to cut your lawn without a bag just kind of mulch it rather than bag it up because of all all the the grass that's being bagged and being hauled away by the garbage trucks and stuff uh-huh and it's uh i guess a lot more ecological ecological to just mow the grass and let it work it's way back into the soil well did you watch the program the other night on um was it Save America it was good i saw part of that the only thing i guess thought um that i haven't been trying is when i you know go to take a shower to save the water and to put it on my plants which i had never thought about before um-hum uh-huh but i've already gone to oh i started years ago i guess not years ago but yeah i would say five years ago turning off my fountain i mean my water faucet in the sink when i brush my teeth uh-huh but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water that was surprising to me yeah um i missed that question totally i mean really bad i'm trying to think i didn't miss too many i can't remember what my score was but i did exceeding well i was surprised but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed that was a shocker to me yeah well there are a lot of things that aren't i'm that's uh one of the things i wonder about uh one of the questions was do you think more should be done or something else i i wonder about some of the products products that they don't take like some of the plastics and things that they don't take uh why why they couldn't do more recycling with those well i was in uh Bizmart the other day and what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there and it cost more than regular paper than regular paper hum and it was only i think uh forty cents more you know fifty cents more but yeah it upseted me to realize that hey the recycling that they're going through the expense of recycling but people aren't buying it so the cost of it is higher true yeah i noticed that about things like i seen i seen a lot of adds recently for organic fertilizers and lawn additives and that type of thing but the cost is is like double or sometimes triple what the regular things you fertilizers and things you buy so in in terms of that it's you know uh-huh for the environment it its there is good reason to do it the cost is kind of prohibited now see that's recycling you know companies that do at least go into it i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something or taxwise or something heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular uh-huh so that people would use this stuff reuse over again yeah it's a good idea it's like when he was saying uh which one was recyclable which was reusable and the recycle ones are better to use but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles uh-huh yeah true and if we're going to really do something they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it i had to put my bifocals on to see it um that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf you haven't got enough nerve to say well put it back it's not recyclable yeah i i'd heard something stranger talk about bottles the other day on uh on the radio station i think it's K L T Y they were talking about the i think it's in Canada they're using oh recyclable milk jugs plastic milk jugs uh-huh as a a reinforcement for roads for road repairs oh really and apparently they they don't break down very easily and oh they don't expand or or contract when the weather changes and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing well you know they're along that same line they said they were using um what is oh i know it was toilets smashing the m up because they're that stuff there is great for in road work uh-huh huh and i thought well that's good and then i saw recycling on tires between uh well hoses were being used uh-huh and uh uh soaker hoses made out of old tires what else something else was made out of old tires i was trying to remember what it was yeah oh i can't think of it now but i was i was trying to get my uh kids you know to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes uh-huh and just anything to you know recycle rather than keep throwing it away but my biggest problem is i take the bags out of the store buy the bags to bring them back and then i forget to bring them in the store yeah i'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out i wish they'd really push this recycling bit because i never realized i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away well i think the the more people are aware of it the the more they'll do i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that you know what i'd like to see a little more i don't have any little tiny kids but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now uh-huh yeah in five years when they get bigger it'll work a little bit more too true because it's we've all got to do it right now i just i really amazed to find out that what is it eighty per cent are filled now in in garbage fills in five years we're supposed to be at max uh-huh i don't think i can keep my own garbage i mean i might not have that much but i would  okay so um seeing we're both from different parts of the country um i imagine that uh social changes have happened in both areas but you know is rapid i'm not sure could you tell me some of the things that's happened in your area well i thought the second part of the question you know how do you perceive life in the United States differently you know as opposed to ten to fifteen years ago um yeah you know that one my oldest children are are fifteen so that's huh you know that that was immediately what clicked in my head what do i see now different than i do you know when they were born when they were born yeah you know um i have my oldest are two girls they are fifteen and fourteen oh boy so not quite fourteen the um i think we're seeing lots and lots of of changes as regarding families you know at that point i felt like i was one of the few people that truly wanted to children and now i think you're seeing that a little bit more it's coming back again oh is that right and but people are certainly having their children their families later you know it's not uh yeah in some cases uh and the ones that are having them earlier they're having them a lot earlier like eleven or ten that's yeah that's early uh i was kind of young i i got married as soon as i got out of school and started raising a family so um-hum uh my oldest is uh thirty four and my youngest is going to be twenty six uh-huh uh-huh uh so that uh definitely makes a difference my husband was quite a bit older when we married and we decided to you know we wanted to to get our family pretty quick you know and yeah right yeah um that was you know really a definitely uh identifying factor you know we began yeah i don't i i'm not sure about that excuse me in having a well i know that uh here in Dallas we have the unfortunate um reputation as being i think it's the fifth largest of uh i'm trying to think how that was fifth on the list of teenage mothers in the United States is that right oh yeah we have i think in nineteen it seems like the statistic was for nineteen eighty eight in Dallas County there were yeah the problem yeah i want to say three hundred and fifteen gosh that seems like an awful lot well of children born to mothers under the age of thirteen oh yeah but under thirteen probably what do you contribute that to then as compared to say uh uh twenty years ago you know with with children it can't be education because you know there's more and more family related issues being raised at school um you know they're lot more progressive more pointed sex education programs all over the country yeah right right right i grew up in kind of uh there was a rural area and there was nothing but farms and mostly mostly dairy and orchards apple orchards and you know peach orchards uh one thing that i really see a difference and i guess you know overall uh you know that it's a negative is that you know these kids and we live in suburban a suburban area of Dallas yeah these kids do not have the aunts and uncles the cousins you know that built-in kind of security you know why because we're a more mobile society yeah i think so uh people are just moving out getting jobs and our families on you know of course you have lots and lots of moms working that's that's a big problem because at least i i see that up here when when i was growing up and going to school uh people never locked their doors and uh you know you had family that was that's right generally in the area most people kind of stayed put you know very few moved away uh-huh um so there's kind of a nucleus of cohesion there right that you could rely on you know if you were ready to just you know yeah i think the whole country back then was naive strangle your parents you kind of had course there's just a different uh just different feeling as to who who's in control i don't think we ever talked about children's rights yeah you know we didn't talk about women's rights you know we sure didn't talk about kids' rights yeah right and and right children have children have responsibility but i think the the biggest thing now is that uh information is is passed on a lot quicker with with TV and radio and uh oh yeah uh children are under a lot more pressure because from their peers than than it used to be well you know i can remember as a teenager um you know we would get things fashion wise you know we always consider considered Dallas the third coast you know i mean you know feel very uh um yes right yeah always felt like we were on the edge of of new trends and you know i had a lot of uh friends and in right Wyoming and Utah and Colorado because that's where my parents were from uh and we would go there they were always seeing movies that had been here six months before and they were wearing clothes and saying lingo using new lingo that yeah we heard way before and so we always felt you know a little you know kind of thumb your nose and yeah but now that's not so you know if those those those parts of the country aren't behind you know they're getting the movies if not you know that's right right at the same time they're getting them you know six weeks later it's not you know not so yeah yeah um and yet i think i think we're really evolving right now i you know the seventies and eighties were so uh get all you can cause you may not be here tomorrow and money hungry i think we're seeing some comeback to family um yeah i think i yeah it's uh a family unit yes um but you can't trust anybody anymore it's it's a different family unit though yes it is you know it's not the same that we traditionally thought of no it it goes back i guess way way back peo ple had a lot of children and they and they they were kind of uh they most of them were on farms i guess or they worked in factories at least in the east you know my father my grandfather and his father before him always worked at this place so then i would work at this place uh-huh uh-huh um out in the rural areas we were always farmers or was always going to be farmers so you had a lot of children they kind of money didn't seem to be important back then when we uh moved to this particular town this a suburb of Dallas ten years ago there was still a lot lot of agriculture of of land that was used for agricultural purposes and that is just you know every year just a little bit more a little bit more slips away so yeah but with a uh excuse me with a uh run by families or or were the younger children going out into the world and then they were bringing in i don't know um you know labor is to to take care of the crops i think probably main a lot of it was you know contract labor um because the kids wanted something more i guess yeah the kids want something more there's a great deal of respect in this area for agriculture and for the foundation that it has given this particular community and we still have a couple of very viable families who are you know make large contributions time money you know emotionally to the community and preservation preservation of its heritage but we don't uh yeah you know but but even their concerns are becoming more diversified yeah i i your but you know one thing that and this is just totally off the wall but it's another uh another element as we see the encroachment of of progress on just the ecosystem ecosystem when we moved here and the the fields were mowed every summer we would have this massive influx of crickets right from the fields into our homes you know just i mean crickets so thick you couldn't walk without stepping on them yeah and course that then brought different birds that didn't normally come to our area and i don't know what all other effects on the ecosystem because that's not my bailiwick but see we don't have that anymore yeah so you wonder what other little man's changed it uh-huh i was reading in uh i think it was the Reader's Digest just earlier in the week about  i know uh that Texas laws are more uh what's the word i want more real i think realistic because they do believe in capital punishment and they do every once in awhile exercise that that's true uh we're as i said Indiana's very conservative and i cannot remember the last time anyone was electrocuted or whatever method they use nowadays to carry out a death sentence do they have a law on the books up there they have uh uh you know i'm just not even aware of what the law is it's uh been so long since anyone was executed that it might be legal but it's not done right my husband would know whether it's legal or not but i am not very so what's your uh opinion on capital punishment i believe in capital punishment for certain crimes do you yes uh uh-huh there's you know there are some things just that just are inexcusable right brutal crimes serial serial serial crimes things like that uh-huh um you know to me the punishment doesn't even fit the crime but you can't get any worse uh-huh they uh i think to me i think they have to come to that with uh as you say brutal crimes because of the prison system being so crowded that seems like just because you don't have a place to put someone doesn't seem like a very logical reason to kill someone else which of course is what it is but i think it would be a detriment to crime or would be a deterrent to crime because i know someone who's mad isn't going to think well gosh i can't do this or they'll put me away but somehow i think if the punishment doesn't fit the crime the crime's more likely to happen right i think in a way it's unfortunate they've come up with with nice ways to um execute people i guess to me if if i was a uh potential serial killer or something it wouldn't stop me to be uh to die of lethal injection i mean it's as painless as you can go uh-huh i mean i think if i was in a bad accident and they gave me the option i might say yeah you know give me an injection but uh go with it huh you think they should go back to crucifixion then i don't know about that um but uh you know the electric chair on the other hand is probably a pretty painful way to go i don't know um i don't know personally i'll never be in that position well we certainly hope not so but i don't i think it should be something that is that is a deterrent that's something that that that's scary and it's something that's going to make you make you be afraid to uh afraid of the consequences do you think uh you know uh lately they've had oh in the last few years they've had some cases where women have killed abusive husbands do you think that they should be faced with the death penalty depends on the nature of the abuse and i really don't uh you know that that's it's something that's got to be evaluated on an individual case you know because uh-huh there's there's really no excuse for abuse but then there are other options there are ways to get out it does happen though doesn't it yeah i mean there you would hope but i guess it's really a it's easy to say but uh you'd hope that someone in that situation would you know get out there are enough support groups enough you know over the century over the last decade or so anyway there's been uh-huh you know you don't have to kill your uh kill your husband because he's beating you up all the time you can can leave and have support it's not like you'd be stuck on the streets yeah even in our small town of five thousand we now have a crisis center and it's been in existence for five years so even in this area where you would think there might not be the help uh there is help for women who are abused or children who are abused or whatever uh i can't imagine uh a mother standing by and watching something destructive happen to her children but i have a friend who's is a school teacher and she has a nine year old girl in her room who is suffering abuse and the mother is aware of it and is not protecting the child which just makes your skin crawl to even think about it but this is almost as much of a crime and i guess and i guess i don't know it's to me it's almost as much of a crime to just let it go yes yes she's as guilty as he is and i think i guess it gets back to if if if a woman kills her husband because he's been brutalizing her or her children there's maybe more of a reason and it's not an irrational you know just a brutal crime for the sake of just i don't know without a conscience or something like like some of these uh-huh uh-huh that's kind of what i think what capital punishment should be for is you know somebody that's just you know missing something upstairs or just goes out and you know rapes and brutalizes a woman and turns around and does it again uh-huh and it's like there's just no excuse you there's no reason i should pay for this person to spend the rest of his life in in prison so you think our our uh values have to come down to dollars and cents no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the way the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded yes and we're giving people that aren't going to change we're just we're just housing them until they die uh-huh and if they've you know caused as much pain and suffering as they have for for no reason and they're going to do it again if they get the chance uh-huh it just just doesn't seem uh i guess the most frightening thing to me uh you're probably young enough that you've not aware of the Richard Speck case uh it happened in uh the Chicago area but it was certainly broadcast nationwide he broke into this uh complex uh apartment complex and killed these seven nurses and every once in awhile you know one of them did survive she crawled under a bed and he missed her somehow and she did survive and she did identify him and there is no doubt that this is the man who did that and every once in awhile he comes up for parole and it's scary to think that some board is sitting there trying to decide whether he is right rehabilitated to the point that he can go back out in society when these young twenty twenty two twenty three year old nurses are all dead it just doesn't seem he should i think have made that his life should have been sacrificed for what he took as you say the punishment has to fit the crime doesn't it uh it's just like uh back in California the Charles Manson thing uh-huh and of course he'll never i don't think he'll ever get out on parole just because it was so well publicized uh-huh but uh you know he comes up every so often uh-huh or Sirhan Sirhan and right yeah of course also believe in deportation but that's another subject isn't it maybe they ought to have an island out in the middle of the ocean we can drop them all off take them back to Australia the way the English used to do yeah Australia might not care for that these days i see they've gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that on an island so far away there's no chance they can ever get off yeah nice talking to you bye-bye yes alrighty bye  there you go um-hum well well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend uh sentencing uh-huh uh now my personal opinion uh i don't know uh uh here lately it seems well up until a few years ago i guess there there was uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about everybody everybody and i don't think uh um-hum those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole it's just not right um-hum i think i agree with that very much i do you and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and it's hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done uh yes very possibly so many of us have led led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury i've never done it myself um-hum um-hum i never have either unfortunately i wish i could have uh-huh uh is there a reason why you have never i've just never been called up uh-huh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uh-huh well now that's possible but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury uh-huh uh-huh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury not that i know of somebody told me the other day that there is what what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true uh-huh uh i've never heard of it i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision and that i wasn't sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not uh well there again uh i suppose it should be that would mean they all would have to decide exactly exactly one way or the other is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial uh-huh um-hum yeah yeah and now that that's not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances i mean that's happened um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh giving them another another another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence bring some of these things out um-hum yes uh we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever they're accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that hum um-hum uh but i would suppose there are circumstances you're in the wrong place at the right time or know the person wrong person at the right time oh that's it and you just might resemble somebody um-hum uh out here in Texas we had a a a a great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a 7-Eleven i think it was um-hum ah um-hum um-hum um-hum and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot they still found him guilty they they found him guilty when people said he was at work well they said it was that this happened during lunch time and he could have disappeared uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery uh-huh well uh-huh yeah but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and proved to prove that he was innocent uh-huh oh for heaven's sake so there's nine years of that man's life gone um-hum exactly now that just was not fair no huh-uh yeah i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies we're we try bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the one's that are on trial so yes unfortunately that's what happens and yeah and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world well it's not the uh uh it's it's it's not the best system but it's the best one in the world yeah it's the best one that exists i guess so uh-huh and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them and everything and but uh oh i don't know i think the Supreme Court um-hum well i'm i'm i'm still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag oh i think a lot of people are i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action um-hum yeah yeah and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that um-hum uh burning burning a flag i'd i'd try to kill them i would that bad huh i wouldn't like it but i don't know if i'd go that far well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea uh-huh uh-huh and uh well i saw what the red in the flag represents yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is is so important it's important in so many facets of our life um-hum and uh i i i feel like if they don't people don't like what our flag stands for they're welcome to go some place else exactly yeah see what they there's nobody holding them here see what how they like it under another flag right they'd soon be back i'm sure um-hum yeah well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this um-hum yeah i don't know about the judge making the decision if that's do you think that's good you know like if a jury oh passing sentence well uh uh yes uh-huh yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation that's what i was thinking they they sometimes do yes oh yes yes uh i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what um um-hum but uh i know i'm always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a guilty guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen yes yeah of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five um-hum well i think that's where a lot of people think boy they're getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole they're denied it depends on you know what they're what they'd been guilty of and um-hum and a lot of different things i guess yeah but too many times they they are permitted permitted to go out on parole and um-hum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again yes they just go out and repeat their crimes um-hum um-hum well there well they say after after three offenses why it's automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses um-hum um-hum i always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes there's not a good the balance isn't right it doesn't make sense um-hum uh yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so so frequently um-hum um-hum uh race or nationality even um-hum yeah so but uh like you said it's uh it's it's it's not the best system but it's the best one we've got yeah right so let's put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so um-hum sure enough so Jean it's been awful nice talking to you well it's been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week well let's hope neither one of us ever have to run into this this uh with subject we've been discussing take care now bye i hope not you too bye-bye  do you live in Plano or work in Plano or both both are you a TIer both yes are you at work right now uh-huh so am i in building which building are you well are you Summit or are you uh uh Spring Creek i'm i'm Spring i'm Spring Creek oh this is fun what building are you in i'm building uh one oh i'm building two at least we found something different that's i've never had a call who've that like that neither have i no isn't that funny i usually get some place i got a woman in New Jersey the last time i called i think right that's funny that is funny so the weather so how's the building how's the weather in building two the weather in building two is cold it's been cold in the building outside the building's not bad not bad typical TI Spring or TI listen i got me doing it typical Texas Spring are you a native to Texas ugh oh yeah no no i'm i'm a transplant from California from so what do you think of the Texas weather not as nice as California how long have you been here oh five years now i've been here long enough pretty long so oh okay you you you you know about August then yes oh i've been through five of those okay there's no surprises left right right a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple weeks in August for you know if they're going to go out of state for vacation that's the time to go um-hum good idea real good idea yeah we went up to Wyoming this last uh Summer during that time and it was like you know eighty degrees up there it was beautiful it was nice to get out of Texas for a while we went to Alaska well that's that's the even even farther away that is really nice it is so cool you wear a jacket you know or or even in the Summer time huh yeah or keep one handy uh-huh uh-huh because it's it rains a lot in Alaska is that right uh it they call it their liquid gold is that right um but it you know you get sunshine and it's lovely and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice and moist and very green and blooming oh my goodness it's pretty well Texas isn't bad green um right no no not in the Spring right i i i have to think every year to try to remember what it was what's it supposed to like this time of year Spring is nice yeah because March we usually get a lot of rain in March you you know it'll seem the the news the Harold Taft you know on the local news he's says oh March we typically get a lot of rain and we've had this many inches and you know we're right on target you know and right and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in March but i you have to it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once and it and oh we always we we always do though uh it that's right and then we get all that heat right well it's just that you know when it rains it rains you know in California you get these nice lovely rains you know nothing really downpours you know like downpours like you have here you know right the other day we had some hail the biggest hail i've ever seen in Texas yeah when i live in Garland oh really oh you got into that bad stuff yeah we got hail the size of marbles i mean just just so noisy hitting the house and the glass on the windows it didn't break anything but we went out there afterwards and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn isn't that strange i know i just you pick them up you know and they're they're perfectly round you know and i go gee how did they form you know and have so perfect like that isn't i and i think that's one of the strange strange things and you very seldom see it though right right you i've i've seen hail you know but they're usually the size you know of a tiny tiny pebbles you know really small you know but this was uh really large so it had come it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently is that correct uh uh i don't know how hail's formed tell you the truth you don't think it's cold enough you know to i think i think that's to it's not on the ground but in in the clouds it is right must be i guess and it doesn't i think you know all that falling would warm it up and melt it but it maybe that's what rounds it i don't know but tumbling i was dumb i was in uh Florida for a week uh-huh on business and uh i had called back to the house i stayed the weekend and i called back to the house my housekeeper was babysitting my cats and dogs said something to the effect of now we've made the national news don't get upset and don't worry it's in Garland where all the bad weather is i said okay you know and i watched the news and i thought ha ha that's Garland that's not Plano i don't have anything to worry about i was on the plane heading back to Dallas before it dawned on me stupid you own property in Garland uh-huh felt so dumb finally i got home found out my property was okay there was no problem with it but i guess you just tend to think of of where your house is you know and nothing else um yeah right right and close to that what's it's called Duck Creek that runs through part of Garland that's the part that always seems to to get hardest hit when there's there's the hard rain the the creek overflows and oh oh i see a lot of houses a lot of houses around that creek seem to to get flooded the streets and stuff around that area get a lot of flooding oh okay the house that house that i bought is close to a Firewheel Firewheel Firewheel golf course okay it's just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through right that's where i live close to that oh really yeah uh uh not quite uh i don't live in that Firewheel division but i live close by there in north far north Garland yeah they're supposed to it it's getting built up you know with more new new shopping centers and and things you know it's a fairly new area is that a nice area yeah and uh and they're supposed to be building a mall somewhere close by by the next by ninety three or ninety four or something a brand new mall well not too far away from that area so it should be nice the house that the house that i bought was really really nice uh-huh in the Firewheel Estates there whatever uh-huh uh yes yes really really nice home very pretty uh uh-huh but you're not living there right now no i'm going to lease it it's it's investment property oh i see i see but it is really it's a very nice place uh i i would cheerfully live there at you know of course it's not my home and and i've lived in my home in well almost ten years and you know i've got everything just exactly like i want it but if i were to live some place else it certainly meets my standards it's a nice house i like it right it should yeah that's a nice area is it on the golf course or no it's not it's off the golf course and i'll be honest with you i have i'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is uh-huh is that right it's but it's in the estates that adjoin it yeah right right well that's a nice area yes it is that really is a nice area when they get that highway finished finished you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go fairly quick yeah that one ninety that one ninety is just going to be the most outermost outermost loop around yeah right another belt line just uh farther out go right just continue to do that right right right where are you from in California southern California uh San Diego i've lived in San Diego for six years when i was a kid younger and and LA area and my parents live in Anaheim right now lived up in in north of Los Angeles in Thousand Oaks area where the Cowboys have their training camp or used to anyways i've been through all of that uh there is an area beyond Thousand Oaks north of Los Angeles that's really an eerie strange looking area with boulders uh i wonder they're not really hills they're more like just yeah was it huge boulders with very little vegetation huh i'm not familiar with what is it along the coast or or more inland uh very well you know it may be a little bit more inland that is one of the strangest areas i have ever seen um uh i had to go up TI on business a couple of years ago out there huh uh-huh and we went up that coastline and i was just amazed how unusual that looks huh here hang on just a second i've got a Los Angeles map let me just quick yeah they have some pretty nice weather out there in Los Angeles uh Simi Valley Simi Valley okay i know where that is yes beyond Thousand Oaks i know where Simi Valley is i've been out there before sure you don't think that's strange looking i didn't notice anything strange i guess oh okay maybe i'm maybe i'm used to Texas about it maybe Texas the way the elevation is extremely high uh-huh it's got curving roads on it but but the it's just a strange landscape there's very little vegetation huh i didn't i don't remember seeing that part of it i know Simi Valley yeah it's just a suburb of LA and they've built some new highways out to that area and things lately right it's a far people can get in and out of LA faster easier maybe it's a place i went to it was uh far extreme thought we'd never find the place huh it was interesting yeah that sounds interesting because we went out the Ventura highway to Thousand Oaks and on up through that way right right right i i know exactly i i i lived that area it's a nice area out there i love Thousand Oaks uh Texas i don't know things things you just have a less a variety i guess it's i think i don't think it's quite as green you know it it's green with all the trees and things out here but it's just oh it's green sometime yeah but it's just you know i don't know well it doesn't stay green you know the really and and in all honesty i i know this sounds like a Texas story all honesty you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years we haven't had a really bad one right yeah i i i missed that one of eighty or eighty two or eighty one that had the heat wave uh it was maybe eighty two because we bought our house in eighty one and we built a pool in eighty two yeah no  uh so Jack what type of music do you like well i like uh classical and uh sort of uh popular rock type music um uh-huh yeah i enjoy classical too i never really had listened to it till i i got married and and my wife um enjoys it oh uh-huh so i i had never listened to it before till then but now i listen to it well whenever she does and every once in a while i'd put it on myself you know um what yep yep so i yeah i used to play the piano and i like uh Bach and oh yeah uh sort of the baroque music Handel and uh-huh Vivaldi and those kind of oh yeah see those are those are really nice i like those though i i couldn't tell you anything about them other than what my wife says this is Bach you know yep yep oh yeah yeah well i you know i don't i don't know all that much myself i just i just know when i hear it that i like it um-hum yeah that you what you like how about popular music yeah uh whatever's on the radio is is usually okay with me but um hm sometimes have a hard time understanding you know hearing the words clearly if i'm in the car and there's noise and stuff so it's mostly just the tune yeah yeah i'm pretty much the same way you know people always say wow the the meanings of those words and i'm always meaning there's words well you know i just thought they just all sort of rhymed you know yeah i know yeah i know i know about the only thing i can remember after the song is over is the refrain right yeah that whenever they say it two or three times yeah yeah i'm the same way yeah it's funny um depending on where you live i i i commute back and forth between Baltimore and a rural town called Salisbury which is yeah uh-huh two and a half hours away and the difference in the radio with popular music is totally different you know when yeah because Baltimore'll play more um what might be considered more little bit more progressive uh-huh uh-huh oh really um-hum and as soon as you go down to Salisbury this town that's you know uh two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever uh in the real rural Baltimore uh Maryland they it turns into basically classic rock yeah yeah and they don't you know yeah mostly oldies but classic rock you know with if you know like when the Doors movie came out you know Doors was really on the radio there oldies or what yeah uh-huh you know where you know you'd hear what's one or two of their more famous songs maybe top forty in Baltimore but in Salisbury you would that's all you would hear was this is the Doors you know so was sort of a funny thing oh yeah yeah yeah yeah there's a big variation among the country i mean if you go down south and country music and you you yes that's i'm starting to realize that i never really thought about that much but there is yeah yeah yeah yeah i never so i never i didn't i i lived in Pittsburgh before Baltimore and i didn't i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area uh-huh i really didn't notice at all it just seemed the same but when i went more rural you know that it really changed so yeah yeah yeah Chicago has a lot of good stations um yeah um fact they have a they have a continuous news station which is nice if you're driving and you wanna hear oh does it yeah yeah now you don't have to wait till the hour mark it's it's it's sort of constant you just turn there and um you get the latest news and everything it's uh it's sort of like CNN you know you turn on your TV it's on um-hum right yeah boy that would really be beneficial because you never hear the you never hear the news basically on the radio i never get it so yeah yeah yeah you know and if you don't if you don't read the paper you sort of fall behind if you're in the car all the time hm yep yep yep yeah that's pretty good so yeah i like to listen to tapes uh of music or or um stuff on a long trip and um now you can even get books on tape um um-hum um-hum yeah yeah in fact my my uh my grandmother does that a lot because she's blind or what she's losing her sight or whatever but yeah that of in i can imagine you know if you're driving cross country uh-huh yeah yeah um-hum you know uh listening to a story lot of the classics are really on tape yeah right yep yep so that's a lot of fun but yeah that that would be good yep well we strayed a lot from music but i but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening so as long as you're listening so yeah i guess so well right right right yep but if you do if you do have to go something i guess we can just cut off yep okay well Jack it was nice to talk to you and and good luck and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls bye yep nice talking to you Tom all right good thank you bye bye  okay where were where were you from um just here in Dallas oh okay because i uh i talked to a professor in uh uh-huh what was it North Carolina who got the the TI system and he gave to all his students so my daughter's even talked to and i've talked to several people from North Carolina i was just curious that's yes yes that's true i've talked uh-huh people from Virginia and and all over yeah have you too yeah i talked to the professor and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think i'm the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students so that's why so many people are from this college uh go ahead you you first uh-huh oh okay um well the subject we're supposed to be talking about let's see is uh food food what type of foods do do you cook and what would you uh cook in uh uh let's see if you were giving a dinner party and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon and to me that's the type of thing that i like to oh great give in um uh cooking for people and uh if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and uh you don't have to do all that much work you know you just uh slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go yeah we have them too and i i'm trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer uh my wife uh doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it uh and we haven't catered out very much uh we would i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the man always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect uh i've made shish kabob which i like it's fairly easy and fast uh-huh uh where i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do um-hum for for having uh uh a dinner uh-huh i do cook but not i'm mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh although i would like to experiment with uh yes the meals my mother made you know so to speak and i haven't gotten around to that yet uh uh-huh what kind of meals did she make that you liked well she was Polish and uh she would make very economical meals we were very poor different rice and ham and things that uh she would throw things together um-hum uh-huh and galunkies and all that and uh i would like to try that one day and she would make spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything and my wife of course thinks i'm crazy which i may be too but uh huh no sounds interesting uh-huh yeah that's great yeah but dinner parties are a lot of work uh yeah yeah but uh that's that's why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better people can entertain themselves i think a great deal yeah more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kebabs where you have to do a whole bunch of work yeah yeah well that that shish kabob is uh just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh uh-huh so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a little a few minutes uh but anyway i'm i'm thinking of the easy way rather than my guests i guess but uh right yeah yeah well i i think you do do a lot of work even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything everything prepared and utensils and just just everything right right uh but you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish i'm thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions uh-huh yeah oh yeah and then you'd simmer it like all day long right you'd get the odor of it yeah oh it would because yeah and it was just it was just wonderful that's that's something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for but we used to have that at Thanksgiving time uh-huh yes because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this and and there's so much broth and juice in there that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice oh great and that was you know when you were talking about the the Polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that that's uh that's what i thought about was that Armenian rice dish oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that that's true that's true the recipes are really interesting you know we're probably going to lose them we'll probably forget all about them you know since we're trying to make everything so simple here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know um-hum right right i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh something see my wife's from Texas so uh remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mother's house for Christmas you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh i'm looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey i said we don't have turkey at Christmas i said we only have turkey on Thanksgiving i said we're going to have a ham she said what um-hum oh uh-huh yeah i said yeah i said no turkey is only for Thanksgiving and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had ham you know uh-huh right right and and and that's one thing also that's another recipe i guess we could talk about now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know i i'd like to try that too uh-huh uh-huh yeah you know what i found was at Sam's uh wholesale uh stores and uh what they have is this honey baked ham that have you seen have you had any of those yeah oh yeah i saw them that's good no i i uh i i've i know about but i think goes if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i don't remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and all the juices and everything are all sealed in and i tell you what if um-hum oh really it's never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally don't like ham because it's so salty oh i haven't heard of that yeah yeah but with this honey bake that they have that that's the only one i have been able to find there at Sam's warehouse it is absolutely delicious and it slices great um-hum um-hum oh yeah i'll have to ask her about that uh because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells i can't think of his name of it uh i don't know i see a can here or a box here Gourmet Choice uh he delivers uh what is the name of this thing i got a box where is it distributed marsh it doesn't say Gourmet Choices but he but it's a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and um-hum and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh i i never i wish i could tell you the name of the company but i don't know what it is but uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it it was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything we had it for breakfast a long time it was really great uh-huh um-hum wow you know that sounds like it yeah but that's that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy i would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and i keep saying this uh to to do the different things that we did but i would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if because i don't think in in my married life which is uh twenty six years now we've never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and that's it you know wow um-hum right in the old days we had hams were the meal and i don't i don't think we really have it as a main meal right that's true i i don't think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those good things right yeah that's an interesting point how how have you changed your your meals now have you into that uh looking at those things uh-huh oh yeah well my parents actually started it and uh getting uh-huh parents that's unusual well it it's true i think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the um you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore and then gradually they started switching over to um plain rice um oh yeah no gravy it's just it really is they uh they're actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus um that's amazing us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies uh yeah yeah well that's amazing they'd go that they have started usually it's the younger people doing it yeah it's true it's true i agree with you so it's really neat i uh my my wife's mother is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i have i have too but not like hers um-hum um-hum and i always get after her about salt and everything else and she just will i mean she's going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know that's right right and uh i like to i'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way uh um-hum um-hum uh it's it's not the i listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend he's a fitness expert and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else and um-hum and uh throwing away peanut butter and all the things things not to eat you know ever i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away forever and then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk wow um-hum you know try that sometime my wife says she can't stand it but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe uh-huh i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if i'm making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i i'll take out all the yolks but one wow and it's fine you you don't miss it uh in fact when i when i make eggs for myself huh if i if i fry them throw them in there i will almost hard fry them so i can take not eat the yolk at all uh-huh uh-huh and you don't really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk but uh you don't eat it at all you know you don't or hardly you get like uh a bite at at the the most um-hum and so uh for cholesterol i mean i'm trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down twenty points uh although wow that's good i haven't gotten on the which whether was it butter or cholesterol not cholesterol margarine and all that i don't know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter uh-huh  hello hi hello hi i'm Sally i'm Jerry Crow nice to meet you and i uh made a mistake i went ahead and punched one so we're on oh okay all righty okay the trial by jury yes uh my thinking on the uh uh unanimous decision i think they should only i think they ought to change that to only in death penalties that it be a unanimous unanimous i think in the others they ought to have um-hum not a majority but say three fourths or something like that uh-huh uh-huh because too many times they get hung up yes and then there's a mistrial right and there's a mistrial uh-huh yeah i agree with that i really do i you know there're two kind sides to everything and and i you know i was i've never been on a jury i've been interviewed a couple of times but never got picked and um yeah i just really have mixed feelings about it because you know i i'm not sure that i'm for the death penalty and yet when i think if something happened to one of the members of my family if somebody you know killed them or brutally beat them or whatever i uh and killed them i i don't know that i would could be able to say that yeah so you know it's i have mixed feelings so if if i were to ever serve on a jury i would have to be honest about that i'm not sure that i could give somebody the death penalty yeah and and so i'm not you know i agree with you i think that uh that um a majority for uh you know a less severe case would be okay but i think for a death penalty it would be have to be everybody yeah and uh i'm not so sure that well a it would cost a lot more but i'm not so sure that life in life without parole is not the stiffer penalty penalty than the death penalty i agree uh-huh but i've always said that i you know i i think that would be the stiffer penalty but we have such a problem with over crowding right now that yeah yeah plus it uh it would cost the taxpayers quite a bit more money exactly exactly and and yet on the other hand you i feel so badly when i see people and uh when i read about people in the paper that have gotten out when they've raped somebody or beat somebody or aggravated assault or whatever and they're out in you know a few weeks or a month or yeah i think that's criminal because most most chances are they'll do it again but they have to let them out in order to make room for other people make room for others and if you they also mentioned about a judge you know doing the verdict well yep i had an experience with that because my i have a brother-in-law that was um did made a mistake and he uh was working as a financial planner planner and they the the company he was working for did a few things that was against the law and the Internal Revenue found you know found out and prosecuted them and he ended up going to jail and he's a wonderful man and the bottom line was that he was greedy he money and all that stuff but when when he went to jail i saw the the side that i had never seen before because we would go and visit him and the judge was the one that was not lenient with him he really throw threw the book at him even though he was he had so many character witnesses and so many people that that came forth for him and he was tough and so sometimes probably the judge might be a little bit more severe severe than the jury would yeah yeah i that's the problem i have with judge giving sentence because don't is that there's not consistency exactly uh it varies even from state to state and even within state um-hum because i remember i was watching uh i think it was either Hard Copy or Current Affairs one of those programs last night uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and this poor uh immigrant had bought some land and had cleared the land there was uh uh uh fill there people had use thrown old tires and junk and everything else in the land um-hum and they prosecuted this guy and fined him like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something like that for disturbing water lands oh oh my word and he cleaned it up it was even cleaner than when he bought it isn't that awful and it's just you know ridiculous and uh yeah and you know i also feel like if a judge has has the last say i i don't care what job you're in you know what social service type job i'm a teacher after a while unless you really watch it you begin become hardened to people's problems and they don't quite mean as much to you you detached yourself from them and i think that might happen with judges too yeah i think that they they wouldn't be too lenient with certain people because they're they're so hardened to the fact that you know there's a reason why all this happened and they don't want to hear the story anymore they just want them to you know go to jail or be punished yeah yeah so i agree with you i'm not too sure i would like to have a judge be the sole you know delegate of uh of a a sentence right i just uh like you say i just i just hear too many cases of of somebody committing a small or a a minor crime and getting a much stiffer penalty penalty than someone else that commits a major crime and gets off lightly yeah and especially and i hate to say this but especially if he's a minority or she's a minority right right uh people have a tendency to automatically sentence people that are Black or or Mexican or any kind of an immigrant before they've even heard yeah and that's sad that oh sad commentary on our times but it happens and uh also they didn't say anything to talk about it but uh the rich people can hire the the uh top notch lawyers right and the poor folk is more or less at the court's mercy exactly and and the rich people get off the hook right it's really is sad but have you ever served on a trial on a jury but i guess i madam ma'am have you ever served on a jury i've got uh i got a summons before but i never got selected i was like you i spent all day down at the courthouse sitting there yeah but didn't get selected and didn't get selected um-hum well i always thought that it would be real interesting but yeah one the one one of the ones that i was came down for was had to do with um drunken driving and um you know i don't think i could be partial in a case like that i just i just uh feel like that that you just shouldn't drink and drive and and i yeah i could not be lenient at all and they asked me a couple of questions and i think you know they came to the conclusion i couldn't you know i would i'd probably throw the book at a person that that harmed somebody drinking and driving so yeah yeah the only one i i got uh not selected but as a as a uh perspective jury member was uh a uh rear end collision row uh-huh and of course i guess there was probably thirty people or forty people there and they called them down uh-huh and they asked if anybody had been ever rear ended to hold their hand up and i had and uh i think they right away they right away they said well this guy won't give a uh yeah won't will be partial yeah i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true well and it's the law is is very tricky and and we all come from different backgrounds and we come from different experiences and so we bring to that jury different perspectives which in a way is good because if we all thought the same way a person that was uh possibly innocent or possibly not as guilty as you know as as uh you might think would you know get the book thrown at them or whatever because we're all we all feel the same way but i know that i have some friends that have been on juries that have been deadlocked and it's no fun i mean because yeah yeah i wouldn't want to be sequestered sequestered for a week and be locked up in a hotel or a motel or hotel or whatever no that's right and especially hard on the people that are not along going along with the majority because the the other jurors get so angry because they want to go on with their life they want to get out of there right and if you don't truly believe what you think and stick to your guns it can be awful uncomfortable right so and uh i guess uh i'm fortunately in working for Texas Instruments should you get hung on a jury you do get get your normal pay yeah oh is that right oh that's good so uh yes same with i'm a teacher and and we do too yeah so which is great is great it would be hard on a person that uh if he did not get that pay to get locked up for two or three weeks on a hung jury and be out the time on the jury plus missing his pay check oh wouldn't that be awful yeah that would be terrible yeah but i guess i guess it's like like a lot of other things in in states uh it's not perfect but it's better than anything else is exactly yeah that's out there you're right you're right and we just kind of have to to go along with it and do the best job we can if we're called it is a duty a lot of people i know try to get out of jury duty when they're you know and i would never do that because i feel like hey we live in a country yeah where we have this you know privilege and i would never that's my duty to be as a citizen of the United States and if i got called i'd do it but some people don't feel that way right yeah yeah all you got to do is read in the paper every once in a while and see where somebody went down to Mexico and had a car accident and got thrown in jail and spent two or three years there oh gosh isn't that awful that'd be awful um yeah we're lucky to live in the United States there's no doubt about it yeah yeah but uh but let's see i really don't have anything else to say about jury and i i believe i'm about uh exhausted my okay well it was good to talk to you all right okay you too and you have a good day bye-bye you too bye-bye  yeah matter of fact it's sort of interesting because they do have uh drug testings at the company i work at they do all right yeah um-hum how do you feel about it uh i don't know i was uh for the most part the people that it's effected have not exactly been the most valuable employees so i personally think that you know it doesn't hurt the business center the work atmosphere um-hum are all employees subject subject uh subject to it or just a certain you know yeah it's basically new employees new employees yeah um existing employees are too but they for some reason they don't uh uh do anything about it you know they don't uh exercise it yeah what about random testing they supposedly have it but i've never heard of anybody getting randomly tested what what type of industry is it Wayne um electrical engineer yeah hold on just a second electrical okay sure my ninth month old just got hold of one of my three and a half inch diskettes i think uh that won't last very long write protection just doesn't uh doesn't have any eat protection on it oh so uh i've i've never been involved in a company that had the drug testing but have been involved in companies that have discussed it one of them very very hazardous type of uh operation um drilling oil and gas wells right and there's enough problem with injuries in that area anyway uh without contributing to it through drugs or alcohol and you know it it was encouraged it's just a matter of a lot of businesses today i don't believe know how to implement a drug program yeah um-hum uh how to really really have a good one whether it's preemployment or ongoing either one yeah they they i think the way they figured out with us is basically just they can globally say if anybody comes for you know an application white black educated uneducated everyone has to take it um-hum and that way you know they're open um and i guess you know our company has a fairly good turnover so i guess they figure that they'll get the majority of employees that way eventually have everyone yeah it at least run a spot check and i think maybe the knowledge that they could have random testing uh may have an effect too now i do know of um two employees that were fired because they they couldn't pass um-hum and i don't know exactly why they were picked out to do the drug testing because i know i wasn't yeah but um i personally don't it's easy to see in some industries you know you don't want uh bus drivers or or pilots to be under the influence of drugs and it's easy to see that type but that's right interesting yeah yeah it can effect uh almost every every office oh yeah yeah ours is for security reasons we're government contractors and they don't want secrets like leaking out um-hum right and yeah are if you're government contractor you probably fall under some type of government supervision on it uh right yeah there are requirements matter of fact i think levied upon the company to have some sort of drug testing um-hum yeah but uh did uh was there much objection to it prior to implementation or oh yeah there was a a big thing saying that it was you know invading people's rights and things like that um-hum which is which you know and but then again it's against the law so it's like how can they you know how can they be invading your rights uh verifying that you've just been invading the law you know and people are confused uh i think too by what is a test you we all know about the uh Olympics and the testing there and how some of them can be wrong and um-hum uh i i think they're afraid of appropriate prescription medication showing up some of them are some of the innocent ones are and they um-hum well they you know they said that um i don't know if it's ever been proven for sure but they were saying that some prescription drugs could show up as being drugs but i think they can and uh i think a lot of it uh that's that's why the type of type of test is important yeah as long as they give you another shot yeah um-hum and we we tend not to know uh we tend to think theoretically but lots of times getting down to the actual method and and results uh being evaluated properly is where we have a short fall right where are you located Wayne um in Virginia in Virginia okay uh um-hum where are you calling from North Carolina oh okay but i've been in in uh Oklahoma for about twenty years so just got kind of got back to this part of this country originally from Virginia oh oh okay well up i'm um up near the capitol up near D C oh okay yeah pretty pretty time of the year up there now isn't it um-hum oh yeah uh the uh yeah Cherry Blossom Festival apparently went all right yeah yeah i i missed it this year did you but uh you know we've we've seen it a couple of times and it's really nice but didn't get to see it this year there are so many things you take for granted when you're in here you know year round DC oh yes do you get to the Smithsonian you know yeah every now and then we've been down there haven't uh taken the kids down yet though we uh took them to the White House for Easter Egg roll but oh good good but i think and uh down in the mall for fireworks and things that's one of the areas uh i've found several areas in the government that i really enjoy seeing money spent and the Smithsonian complex is one of them i think it's great to go through there and see kids of all all sizes and ages going through those buildings there and my oldest is uh two so she's just getting to the age where you know she'd recognize the whale and ever ything like that but um-hum and it'll be a great memory for her later too i think um-hum um-hum well the uh time limit i think is is about up but i enjoyed talking to you Wayne yeah i did too thank you bye-bye all right thank you bye  okay um do you have a favorite credit card that you use um i probably use my Discover card more than anything else because any particular reason uh no i really don't use too many credit cards i'm not fond of them i don't like using them um-hum um-hum but i've just gotten to the point where i'd rather carry that instead of cash yeah i know what you mean but but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of uh-huh i think i've only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times oh really wow um-hum well i use um a credit card that's given out by US Air um-hum well not given out i mean there's an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile um-hum oh and um my husband and i tend to charge a lot and even things that we wouldn't normally charge now we charge because we've racked up seriously close in the past couple of years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging yeah wow and um it's really great because you can get some good discounts um on US Air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that um-hum um and the annual fee isn't bad i think it's maybe thirty five dollars a year um-hum um and here in Rochester maybe in in Pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries yeah uh-huh yeah can you do that there which is great with only only certain certain cards they accept though they don't accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards oh oh do do they accept Discover or no um i don't know they do accept the Discover but i know they would accept like Visa Master Card um-hum yeah um-hum well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage company is starting i think June first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage oh my and that's going to be great um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill um-hum and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest um-hum i refuse to pay interest if i'm going to do that i'm not going to use a credit card exactly exactly so what i do now is i i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it rout i write it out so i'm not fooling myself into thinking i have that money uh-huh you know i write it out and then it's it's as if i paid in cash exactly yeah so you're somebody that will pay off your bills right away uh yes yes definitely that see that if if i don't have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge um-hum i have to have that money before i'll charge it um-hum yep i know what you mean i refuse well i'm a college student and i'm a finance major oh so and um i don't i oh my gosh i probably i have a Discover card well that makes sense i have an AT&T card but i don't use it because i don't even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because i thought if i don't see it i won't use it which is really good because then right i you know a lot of my friends have like outrageous phone bills but i don't have it because i don't use mine oh yeah and um i know i have Montgomery Ward's i have a um a J C Penney's i have a Kaufman's you know i have a Fashion Bug i have a whole bunch of them um-hum um-hum and i just used my J C Penney card and it's a year old and that was the first time i've ever used it really well yeah i just i don't think to use them all the time and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one um-hum um-hum and they're getting to the point now too at the end of the year um-hum all the money that you've you've charged on they'll pay you i think it's ten percent back um-hum a discount yeah yeah so you know i even got a couple dollars back seem um-hum it's definitely worth if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea um-hum yeah because you don't have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then you're getting a month's worth of interest exactly in your account uh-huh um but the second you let it go even one month um they had made an error on our statement where they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything uh-huh and um i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge oh my gosh that's like another purchase for me it buying something yeah me too that would definitely be for me too um-hum yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and a lot of reason i have those cards because J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it uh that's why i have it yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and uh-huh um-hum and uh as long as it because i don't J C Penney doesn't cost you anything i don't think no huh-uh no right and so as long as it doesn't cost you anything then that that yeah and being a college student i get um applications for them all the time i think once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if there's an annual fee if there's an annual fee i ditch it because i don't use them that often so it wouldn't even pay me to get it even if it was you know oh yeah um-hum yeah and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it um-hum um-hum and now she buys everything with her Discover Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know that way she's getting the interest on it too because at the end of the year they give her back her interest um-hum oh yeah um-hum oh right and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year uh wow that is great so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know that's still thirty dollars less um-hum yeah right and that's thirty dollars that you didn't pay any money to have it in the first place exactly and she you know my mom's like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes um-hum um-hum one thing i still don't understand about credit cards is is how you can borrow money off a credit card i still haven't quite figured that out i haven't tried it i don't trust it i know i don't trust it either and um i know you can do it with a Visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that there's some hidden um-hum there's so there's so much fine print that i don't understand that i won't even try it yeah yeah yeah yeah i just rely on my Mac card on your what my Mac card just take it out of the bank oh just yeah the machine one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone uh-huh or you know if i i i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shopper's thing but sometimes they'll be something good that they're selling a record or something like that and um um-hum yeah and after i do it i think God who did i give my number to um-hum and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever um-hum yeah but um the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didn't even know the the store um-hum and they took it right off no questions i just said this isn't my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you can't then um you know just take it off okay um-hum yeah they're usually i think they're usually pretty good about that um-hum uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so yeah oh yeah yeah they would pursue it definitely yeah uh-huh i i'm i'm starting to use my credit card more like i said i'm a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it yeah oh yeah so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books um-hum um yeah so that's approximately between five and six hundred dollars that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good i'm going to get that back i'm going to get a little bit back uh-huh right right yeah that's true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes um-hum but now you can't do it and i know people that have racked up they they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it i i can't see that and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know and when they do that all they're doing is paying the interest on it they're not even paying the principal exactly oh nope they're not even touching it i i uh when when i get to people like that i wish i think the company should just say uh we're not giving you any more until you pay this off i know it don't i realize that the company wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time they're making more money off you right but i think they should have the the consumer the most interest you know yeah it's true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls it's like they're addicted to using their credit card or something oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if they have if they know they have more more on their limit um-hum that i i might i think my brother-in-law is like that actually but um he if he has a hundred dollars left until he reaches his limit he'll spend it oh my God he can't because to him it's like money to him it's like a a loan almost in a sense and he can't bear to i can't i can't do that no i can't either i have like i said i have to i have to know that i have that money before i'll spend it um-hum so i i i don't yeah i don't know of course my mom lives very she was she had twelve kids and of course she she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her i know oh my God uh i don't mind spending my money as long as it's a necessity um-hum and if it's something i really really want but just to go out and start buying i'm not like that and that's something i got off of her and i'm yeah  i think you got it okay uh my first thoughts on capital punishment is i the first thing i want to say is is no just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life um-hum uh we are punishing someone for taking someone's life or in some cases we are punishing someone someone a person for taking someone's life and so in effect we're committing that same crime well it sounds like you have really strong views on it um-hum and i can see that point but i also have this you know i i question i guess i can look at it both ways and just to play devil's advocate right it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know um-hum low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families um-hum our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just exactly that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes uh-huh one thing i don't understand is the the whole concept of death row um-hum okay these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and i'm not saying that i agree with you there um-hum um-hum well i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying what what are we doing with these people it they're they're there we should either take some kind of action right or take enough or or go a different route but they're just exactly and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs oh exactly you know we could be paying feeding poor people and helping you know um-hum helping the environment i mean prison is such a waste of a human being it doesn't do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement um-hum exactly um-hum that to take a human life is wrong right um but you know locking someone up and not getting but you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that i'm saying that you know we're committing the same crime um-hum i also agree that i mean if there's somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough um-hum to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet but oh exactly well uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them all now to me that is inhumane and for two people to be out in the world like that i don't i don't want them in my world that's right that's right you understand what i'm saying i i'm i mean i'm not for killing anyone um-hum but i don't want these people around at the same time we want a safe environment for ourselves and we want to remove them exactly but but i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution um-hum right that is acceptable that does you know and basically you know i i think you know that the whole idea of uh a a death penalty was invented for two reasons it removes removes them from society um-hum and number two it's it's kind of uh it's the punishment it's the ultimate punishment right because you know they've harmed someone and and you know you want to appease the people that have suffered right but it it really doesn't take their pain away um-hum and at and at the same time like you said it drains society um-hum but it's a we i think we should be we the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and put keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to to put these people back in society but prepare them first exactly exactly but that the pob the problem is so incredibly complex i have a friend who works on the pardon and patr parole paroles and she interviews um-hum inmates all the time that are coming up for parole and she says it is just really frightening um-hum how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because they're overcrowded exactly and these people have not benefited from the stay there she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong um-hum and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines um-hum right you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work um-hum and you you want people out of prison you want people to get jobs and and live happy lives so it's um-hum but they can't just walk out of prison and do that they can't just walk out of prison and say okay i'm going to go a different route that's right that's right there has to be some sort of buffer in there some sort of program or and i know this costs money but it couldn't cost anymore money than we're already spending um-hum i know i know i i would like to see the money that's been budgeted budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of of an alternate solutions to the problem um-hum how are we going to fix that Tanya how are we going to make that happen really how what can we do what power do we have oh goodness i mean you know everyone's trying to make it oh you know in their own little world you know i'm trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay um-hum that's right and it's so hard to you know try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them hum oh i know i know um-hum but it it it sounds like you are uh you know interested in what's going on around you and oh yeah and uh you know when you have a a voice you do contribute and i guess that's you know what what we're meant to do and maybe an opportunity will come by that right we will have a chance to make a real change and i i'm a broadcast journalist and so i feel like one day i probably will write a book or or something you know and some of these views will be able to come out i work at channel six oh where where do you work oh you do here i'm a i'm a news reporter that's great and so i i guess i'm i'm pretty emotional about crime things like that now i've only been in it for a year but i get to see pretty much uh close up um-hum you know a lot of things that happen that people don't see uh i got to see get to see a lot of crimes and i get to see you know people's exactly uh pain and things and so when we talk about right most of us are so sheltered you know yeah and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see what's out there exactly um-hum well that you're you're really performing a a benefit to society in doing that um-hum a service yeah but still you know we can't shut we can't i don't i i guess i would like to probably editorialize more we have to just report what's happening we can't say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes um uh-huh you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know that's a i i'm just i'm just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint um-hum and you're right that has got to be a challenge sometimes especially when you are dealing with a a subject like uh capital punishment or something or abortion right or something where there's an an no or yes side and you have your side and you have to report both sides um-hum right but you really don't want to because you have your side and you have to walk right down the middle with it yeah yeah so sometimes that's hard but yeah i'm sure um-hum well that's that sounds interesting and i'll read your book some day um-hum okay good all right well it was nice talking to you i enjoyed it thanks for calling bye-bye okay okay bye-bye  here we go i guess we're on the air huh yeah well i tell you what this been pretty nice today hasn't it yep uh yeah we've been uh real lucky here it was one of those days where you wish you uh you didn't want to have to go back into work um-hum yeah i'm well i'm on i'm taking some vacation this week so it didn't bother me uh i'm a distance runner by hobby and uh i might say it was a little humid running out there tonight i was probably wetter than i have been in some time uh-huh huh but uh for for a guy that likes to be outside as much as i do and run like i do this Texas is almost ideal because uh i would say probably i run three hundred days out of the three hundred and sixty five and there's probably not more than thirty of those days that i can't wear shorts and tee shirt yeah i mean i have to wear long sleeves and maybe some long pants and that's fine with me if i can wear shorts and tee shirt i'm perfectly happy yeah i would i remember how the weather was when i was down there i got a sunburn in February working on my uh my roof in a house in Plano so i uh i remember how it was yeah it's it's really great um here on the east coast we've you know we usually have the traditional April showers but it has just been so unusually wet here yeah we've had all the rain that they should've had out in California yeah well what what what we like to do is get enough rain so not to have to water the lawn yeah and it's been i've watered once in March and not any time in April because i figure we figure if we go five days without rain we need to water and just about every fifth day we're getting rain right now well that's great so everything is pretty and green here and we're not really uh and not having to pay money to water and uh of course of course summers summers uh i i guess uh once you get climatized and i am i mean i kind of look forward to the hundred degrees days except except for the air conditioning bills i i could i could do without the three hundred dollar electric bills yeah i remember those yeah well we've moved into a new house uh at the end of February um-hum and of course it's a new development and there's only one house in the whole thirty houses that are here that has grass oh for goodness sake oh i know what that means so everything everything else is mud that means mud in the road yep there's mud in the road there's mud on the sidewalk there's mud in the house i mean you just can't get away from it and of course it's been you know ideal weather for grass to grow yeah yeah oh sure and unfortunately they haven't gotten around to put they you know they were waiting until they got i think the other two houses on the cul-de-sac on one done before they're going to plant all the grass at one time what what do you do you put in up there do you i mean here we know we know two grasses Saint Augustine and Bermuda uh what what do you normally put in up there uh-huh you can put in any number of grasses up here uh a lot people like the red fescue they like to mix red fescue in with uh Kentucky Blue um the uh uh-huh my favorite is uh a zoysia grass uh when i lived in Laura which is about sixty miles south of where i'm living now uh-huh uh that my neighbor had it and i was forever trying to get you know decent grass to grow in my yard and he talked me into trying to some plugs of the zoysia and i just loved it because the zoysia you can uh you can quite literally just plug it around the yard and it just spreads and it chokes out the weeds and the weeds can't get in there and so you don't have to weed and feed and do all that other crazy stuff you just you know the only bad part about it is during the winter the grass is brown but i mean you know yeah uh-huh oh that happens here too yeah but this year of course we got uh we had a very mild winter this year with very little freeze uh so we didn't have any problem uh uh with the uh uh with the grass greening up quickly you know last year it was well into May before all the bare spots got covered uh-huh uh because of the of the severe winter that we had around Christmas of eighty nine but this year it uh we did have some cold days but not down in the single digits or anything like that so when things started greening up in March they greened up and everybody's grass is is is perfectly green do your homes you say you moved into a new home are homes normally built there with central air conditioning is that part of the uh the standard for a home yes pretty much standard now oh okay i i didn't know whether you were far enough south for that of course i'm i'm from New England my parents are there and it's it's unheard of there i guess anybody that wants air conditioning goes out and puts a window unit in well the uh the thing about uh Maryland is um the last few years uh since i've been back and uh it was like that oh it started this way about mid seventies um we started having a very abbreviated Spring um-hum you would go from having fifty sixty degree days right into the eighty eighty five degree days which you know in Texas it's not bad because the humidity is real low but here when the temperature is eighty degrees the humidity is eighty yeah no yeah the humidity is eighty degrees along with it and eighty per cent and and and worse i mean i've seen days here when the humidity is like ninety three a hundred per cent and it's just absolutely the worst feeling in the whole world yeah uh-hum yeah i'm i'm aware of that did you have a very severe winter uh not really we had uh a couple uh real good snow storms uh but they were the kind that came stayed for a couple of days and then melted off and that's the best kind to have around here um-hum okay yeah yeah we we had zero snow here in fact we haven't had any measurable accumulation now in six or seven years uh yeah i remember the uh ice storm back in uh nineteen eighty eight yeah that was a nice one too that was an ice storm there and uh uh i remember one year yeah i can't tell you the exact year it was probably about uh eighty seventy nine or eighty that we had such a severe ice storm that it uh knocked tree limbs down on the wires and there were some uh four hundred thousand homes out of electricity wow and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags jeez and and unfortunately when it thawed then most everybody's houses got filled with water too and uh but we we were fortunate that year and even at that this development was built in seventy eight and even now all all the utilities run under ground oh God uh-huh so there's still no big trees in the development but the uh uh all all the utilities so we we wouldn't have to look forward to that but we had a uh we had a mild winter as i say the previous year we had three or four days uh it it wasn't much it was only about a week and i think it was the week just prior to Christmas when the temperature got down into the single digits and as a result a lot of the the trees and uh the grass and shrubbery was killed uh was killed out and at this time last year nothing looked very good but it it does right now uh at this time last year we were under water most of Texas was under water uh if you remember uh uh uh downtown Dallas you could go down and look up in the Reunion Tower and look over toward the Trinity River and it looked like lakes not a river yes yeah i remember that and uh Lake Texoma was up uh twenty feet over flood level wow uh at at this time last year it was it was uh it was pretty bad but uh i'm i'm hoping you know you you don't want anything to flood but you want to get normal rain and uh we're probably some where near normal right now yeah i noticed uh tonight when i was out driving around that the uh the one of the main reservoirs in the county i live in is uh fuller that i've ever seen it i mean it's it's up over its banks but it's not that far over its banks how long have you been back in Maryland from Texas uh moved back here in uh eighty nine yes so i spent two uh just about two years exactly in Texas eighty nine okay yeah and where did you say you lived in Plano uh yeah i lived in Plano um worked at Spring Creek for a while and was on the moon job and then when my clearance came through for APD i worked for DSEG uh worked at North Billings for a while and then down at Love Field uh-huh yeah oh okay okay that's a nice facility at Spring Creek isn't it that's the that's the Taj Mahal of TI facilities oh God i tell you it spoils you rotten to work there you you work there and they send you any place else it's like you've been demoted yeah well well we're in the i don't know if you're familiar with the center complex uh in in Dallas it's across LBJ from the main TI site it's three glass buildings and that for someone that's been at TI thirty two years this is kind of unTI like too right i had a uh a uh an employee that i hired there Lita Mytek Lita Mytek i mean she uh she worked over in the building at Center Three i think it was and uh you know she said she liked it over there yeah yeah i'm in i'm in center one the big thing that i think other than the fact that we've all got double the size offices we've ever had anywhere else and it's so quiet that you can hear a pin drop to me the big advantage and i didn't realize it when we came over here is the covered parking it is amazing in the middle of the summer when it's a hundred and ten out to go out and be able to get into your car and touch the steering wheel which we could never do parked outside of the SC Building or the South Building or various other places that i've i worked and and you notice the finish on your car lasts longer when you wash it it stays clean longer yeah uh-huh uh it is is uh uh to me to me that's that's probably one of the biggest advantages that we've got over there plus i'm in center one and the credit union is down on the first floor and it seems that i'm always always there i've got a daughter away from college away at college that's always out of money so it's easy i can get down to the credit union quite often and uh are you looking forward to a hot summer there now um i'd i'd prefer it not to be that hot uh the the days usually aren't aren't that bad um it's just when the humidity gets up i mean it's like last week we had a day it was i think it was eighty degrees but the humidity for some strange reason was only nineteen per cent and that uh-huh uh-huh oh that that's Texas like yeah that was a rarity for here and God it was just beautiful that's Texas like did you ever get out to Midland while you were here no i never did  so how do you keep abreast of the world's happenings when i'm driving to work i listen to a radio station which is twenty four hour news and that's how i get most of my stuff that gives me about uh thirty minutes thirty five minutes each way each day so that's about an hour and hour and ten minutes worth of what station's that uh KRLD KRLD i listen to uh ninety point one which is KERA yeah so uh that's the same way i do it i drive about thirty minutes to work twenty minutes actually so listen to that going and coming yeah uh i don't usually watch the news at night time because uh i'm you know just got home ready for dinner and and all that and by the time i get done with dinner it's already over and uh-huh what a deal yeah well do you feel like you're kept abreast pretty much yeah because they have the uh CBS uh world news on on the hour on the radio so i get all of that stuff then plus i get all the local news uh-huh well what do you think about the US telling the Iraqis to get out of their camp areas uh what do you think i don't know that's pretty strange it's a it's a different bold move i mean uh with still regardless if we won the war or not it's still uh the country is Iraq yeah you know i mean uh with with like with regard to the Soviet Union we're telling the uh Soviets you know hey the Baltic States wanna separate go ahead and let us separate that'll be good you know what what if the American south wanted to separate like they tried to do in eighteen sixties would we be so forgiving and say ah sure go ahead form your own country uh-huh exactly you know i mean seems kind of hypocritical hypocritical of us to to be telling other countries to like go ahead and let part of their country separate off you know and Gorbachev he's the one who wants to keep his country together which i can understand you know um-hum yeah and the other countries that wanna separate they wanna get away from all that garbage the Soviet Union i don't blame them either um-hum yeah it's it's an interesting uh kind of a catch twenty two it's not something that's something that they got to work out for themselves we shouldn't be involved in that we shouldn't even be talking about it you know the government should just stay away from them people and just let them figure out for themselves what they need to do that that is uh that is a bit difficult yeah Bush should not do anything but as as as for the rest of but though i don't you know we get the paper on the weekend um-hum and i'll i'll flip through that you know once or twice but not won't won't read it cover to cover um-hum and uh do you read T News at work yeah yeah that's uh i used to read that all the time i do that all everyday so that's another way but that's mainly you know that doesn't have like a whole lot just a few things on there which is uh-huh did you notice what TI stock closed at today i didn't either huh i didn't see it i hear it's forty two though yeah no it well a couple of weeks probably about a week ago it was at forty seven is that right is that up wow but that was uh i believe because of the stockholders' meeting should've sold yeah exactly exactly the building i was in well it guess you work for TI too pardon me i guess you work for TI too i did until December oh and uh that's how come i don't read T News anymore yeah you got surplused i got i got surplused last year myself yeah did you that's that's great did you just find a a place in another yeah another organization yeah they another TI organization they needed somebody just like me whereas before i was not even doing what i was supposed been doing but uh that's not that's not the topic i guess but uh that's kind of interesting that they can you know say get out of here in one second and then the other side say come on over here yeah so that worked out pretty well for you i was talking talking to a guy from Colorado Springs yesterday who is it did quite a bit better implied or inferred definitely that he has been surplused from up there and he didn't know what he wanted to do he's been with TI for fifteen years yeah oh gosh so it's uh and he's a nonexempt uh he doesn't know what he's gonna do they're just shutting down the whole plant up there yeah yeah it's gonna be a tough time for all around the country i mean you look at the look in the paper and you see all the stuff about you know layoffs here layoffs there and you think oh man what's gonna happen exactly uh-huh you know thank goodness General Dynamics got that big contract because that'll least bring some money to the area right who who got the contract General Dynamics and Lockheed and Boeing oh well yeah i always get mixed up who's their partners with that late latest deal Lockheed and Boeing on this is it Lockheed and Boeing yeah but Lockheed i used to work for Lockheed and at the time i was there they were developing the prototype for the uh that fighter uh-huh and so it was pretty big stuff there then now they got the contract for it so so GD didn't get it or is not associated well they're they're in in partnership with uh Lockheed and and Boeing yeah it's a it's a threesome oh they are okay so it's i thought it was Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas or was that uh Northrop no McDonnell Douglas lost out they lost the contract they were in partnership with Northrop and they lost the contract and so okay yeah that'll be a biggie i wonder what they do with those planes now that they've made as uh test yeah test plane probably sell to somebody who wants to pay for i don't know yeah becomes a new corporate jet yeah there you go old Jerry can use that there you go yeah exactly alrighty well it's been good talking to you yes have a good day bye okay you too bye  well have you ever been a victim of any particular any type of crime uh that's interesting because i've talked about this subject before and it it didn't come up to either one of us to act uh no no nothing that i would consider major probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is uh you know like you know how people throw their change like into uh the glove box or the ash tray of their car and one time we had you know some kids go up and down the street and anybody whose car was open they kind of trashed that stuff out but they didn't do any vandalism and yeah it bugged me but you know when i think of crime and and things that could happen uh-huh i i guess that was minor sounds like you've been very fortunate i haven't had too many terrible things happen to me but my tee tops did get stolen one time off my car i have ah that's a very popular pass time up here do you have a Vette out of right uh no it's a TransAm a TransAm uh in fact there was a ring i know that you stop right up here and uh the police department would call TI security when they knew they were in town basically and say you know tell all your folks with Vets and whatever else to be look on the lookout for them but that's expensive you know it's very expensive and insurance companies don't like it either yeah they don't want to write you yeah well i i did put an alarm on the car after that uh and uh i kept that for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle of the night for no reason and oh that's not good it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so i disabled it well okay now i uh i mean i've had other members of my family touched um i have had a cousin of mine that was murdered uh things like that uh for no apparent reason you know it's that was lost in the country trying to find her folks new house up in Kansas and uh-huh right stopped to use the phone and a teenage kid whose parents had lots of money yeah uh killed her so nothing was ever done to him but so you know yeah i i'm not sure there's many lives that aren't affected by it somewhere uh-huh uh i don't know what the answers should be per se yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh uh systems home security systems that uh install uh yeah uh systems in your home to uh yeah monitor and uh i guess detect uh it's that that type of break ins uh-huh they uh have a certain fee that they charge each month and an installation fee and they're real hot hot about uh trying to get uh trying to sell these systems to everybody yeah i um i would like a home alarms that perimeter alarm system i've been very impressed with the one that the Amway Corporation uh puts together because it's it's as extensive as you want it to be you can you can kind of coordinate to your own home you know however many uh types of devices you need and it's a wireless system so it's not one they can disable do you know what the do you know the name brand is for that the name Amguard okay that's the their own personal alarm brand okay yeah they make it uh-huh and there are several systems like that there's one that uh uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage oh oh that's also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to yeah about my husband he's like one of these like i want to have guns and guns kind of scare me uh not so much for me you know i feel like i'm responsible i'd learn how to use it and yes i could shoot someone if you know they were trying to take my kids or take my life or you know i'm basically a nonviolent person but i could do that but it scares me because of so many accidents that have occurred with children in the home that find the guns and well there's some some uh you know accidentally shoot a brother or shoot a sister or shoot themselves and i'm not real sold on that yet right but there's also a lot of people who are end up being victimized by their own weapons by their own a burglar comes in and uh finds a gun and ends up using it against the owners of the house so yeah well are you for uh capital punishment oh certainly yeah depending on the crime i think i discussed that at at another time well that's interesting that you say that because i am too my my sadness with it occurs that it doesn't seem to be consistent you know i i have a hard time putting one person's death for the same crime that you send the other to jail for right you know it does to me need to be consistent but uh i i well it's such a waste of taxpayers' money too to put them in prison for life for life uh especially if there's no chance of parole that's true so that's true uh of course my husband's of the mind that you ought to take them all out in the back alley and shoot them sometimes that's the best solution i guess i don't know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court uh-huh only because there have been ones sent away that didn't do it but i know that's few and far between yeah i uh i don't know the answer you know i have always thought that maybe the answer to the dope problem that you know generates so much of the crime is you know always you know shoot the dealers and somebody made the you know take away the supply but somebody made a comment to me a couple of months ago that's kind of had me thinking he said uh-huh he said somebody else will come up with the supply he said what you have to do is you know shoot or make it hard on the users because if the demand is gone they won't have anybody to supply to well that makes a little bit of sense well it makes some sense but uh the the users end up being addicts and they uh they commit crimes for for a living to make the the cash to buy their drugs with so sure sure uh and they have no respect or for for any other people anyway that's true but where was it uh oh several years ago and i want to say like Malaysia something with an M Madagascar or somewhere a small country uh you know it's it's a crime punishable by by death to them to be carrying anything and i think some British ci tizens had gone in like uh a lady and her son and they had some marijuana on them and they hung them oh that was in Malaysia and they they were two two guys from Australia was that Malaysia okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because um and i have become accustom ed to other things in hearing other things you know if i knew two of my friends got hung for carrying a little bit of marijuana it might make me think twice before i ever did it if i was of the mind to you know right so i don't know what the answers are but i i do feel like i do feel like when they're blatant criminals and they've got records that it seems like the system protects them more than it helps the others uh-huh well we're not the only country that has a a drug problem no we're not a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce uh death policies against uh drug use and uh uh dealing and things like that so yeah the death penalty uh exists and it is put in force yeah yeah i don't know i know that you know i remember growing up and uh you know we'd leave the house open if we were in the house yeah if we went somewhere i grew up in a large i grew up in San Diego uh-huh you know if we went somewhere sure we'd lock the doors if it was just down the street we wouldn't or if we were in the house we wouldn't but now you know i come home i lock the door if we open the door i lock the screen door you know i want it locked when i'm in it every time i go somewhere and i i just almost hate that feeling right well you make a habit out of it and it's a tolerable situation yeah uh i also grew up in in a rural area and my a lot of my relatives are on dairy farms they would leave the house unattended unlocked just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in they would anyway and there wasn't much of value to take any way so well that's one way to look at it isn't it where'd you grow up uh up in uh Wisconsin oh okay um excuse me but i've been fortunate i guess in that the only things that have happened to me are the tee tops and hubcaps off cars well yeah that's pretty minor when i think that some people give their lives so sure uh-huh so i don't know the answers though i i i do wish we had a system that was a bit more fair yeah and Plano is pretty good about it too they've got excellent uh police force here uh i haven't seen any any evidence of uh any uh mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood oh well that's good the suburbs it's not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city Dallas is pretty bad right i'm sure that's true i'm sure that's true i do know that our neighbor across the street our development is probably only eight years old uh-huh maybe not that long we've lived here six years probably seven years old and uh the house across the street you know she walked in one night on somebody and of course he left she was fortunate yeah but things like that make it real to me and aware that it really is going on right you know that's it not a fairy tale world here that's right yeah i know people that have been victimized too a lot more seriously yeah it's uh it's not pleasant to think about that and uh you have to live with that forever so that's true well yeah i enjoyed talking to you about the subject uh and i appreciate you calling it's Gary right yes thank you very much huh you too bye bye okay have a good evening sure bye  i uh i have not like i was saying i haven't i have not had to make the decision for uh regarding uh care for anyone of my family members however i've had quite a few friends that have had to make that decision well see i don't have a relative that's made it over sixty one uh-huh oh really but my children's on their father's side have them up into the nineties man yeah but uh the only time we came close and we started looking into it was when my grandmother became senile she start senile at fifty huh and at that time the homes that we were looking for when i was a kid uh my mother i can remember them arguing they couldn't find one that it was either clean enough or they took enough care or there was one thing or another that continuously arguing about it uh-huh and they ended up keeping her from relative to relative and of course she died when she was fifty nine so it wasn't that long uh-huh it's a the few i've been in they have varied tremendous uh-huh yeah i think there's there's so many that are uh that are you know retirement homes so uh that are geared toward the ambulatory person you know the ambulatory person that is still extremely active and just wishes not to have to live alone you know separate any longer and then there are the uh the nursing homes which actually provide you know nursing care i guess it goes there's a wide range oh well we were talking about it the other day because a girl at work has got that problem right now uh-huh and uh she keeps saying she's never going to put her mother in one and i says hey look go around look at them they're totally different than your concept concept of what it was years ago uh-huh and i says i don't know what condition your mother's in which i didn't uh-huh but you do have the choice now and i says what is your mother going to do all day long while you're out here at work uh-huh i says think about what she would like to have because a lot of them hey they might be bedridden but at least they've got company and people their own age to talk to uh-huh to keep them home what do you've got that's right they're sitting there like they're they vegetate is what happens that's true that's that's what i would be afraid of i would rather personally i would rather be in a community of other people with a greater chance of having similar interest with them rather than being stuck in a home where i mean if you if you couldn't drive i guess i mean if you're no longer have the the freedom of driving uh-huh then it it changes it so drastically because you can't go someplace to do something when you want to you have you are totally dependent on someone else to provide all your entertainment for you and that would i don't think i would like that i think i would rather if i where in that situation i think i would rather live in a in a nursing home situation see you're not aware of the the horror stories and things like that that i've grown up with uh-huh and i mean i'm talking about horror stories and they're still out there i mean it's it's not something that's eliminated eliminated been eliminated no there are lots of homes out there that just literally people drop them off forget about them and they change hands i mean i'm not saying they don't investigate they investigate it's great when they're there but unless they keep current with it and they changes hands it goes either direction uh-huh because yeah that's true they're relying on a lot of people that hey they're like any other business if you lose a lot of your customers they get into a financial bind that's true and people say well you know they're a nursing home but the hey it doesn't work that way they're a business that's true and and the the nurses that they hire are frequently not um the most qualified in their field and uh well like my neighbor she runs down here to this nursing home down here um-hum and she just point blank's tired the pressure and responsibility of working as a nurse in a hospital uh-huh she admits it she's tired of it so she works down here she's a nurse she's qualified uh-huh but she's fifty oh she's in her fifties early fifties somewhere and working down here at the nursing home keeps her hand in there she gets good money for it and she enjoys the old people you know it's it's just that simple for her uh-huh yeah but uh she says it's hard they get cranky they get obstinate but she feels the same way i do i would rather depending on the situation i would rather be able to put myself or anybody else in a nursing home if i was able to get close enough to them right so they don't feel lost right i think now see my grandmother she wouldn't go in a nursing home besides being scared and everybody else didn't want her she was terrified of one literally and positively terrified yeah because she remembers the old stuff uh-huh my great grandmother was and she was she was terrified that some day someone might try to put her in a nursing home she even wrote a song about it she used to sing but uh-huh uh-huh i mean she she died when she was ninety six and uh from a fall i mean she didn't die of natural causes she died from a fall she uh you know had she been younger it would not she would not have died from the fall but she uh you know and she was still she was still household independent she was independent in the household you know in the home and she couldn't drive but heck but she'd never learned to drive to begin with so i mean it wasn't um her age that had prevented her but she was she was very afraid that someone would try to put her in a nursing home and she lived with her daughter my grandmother until she died and uh my grandmother still at seventy uh she's seventy nine this year uh is living independently and she drives just to church and back and to and to the store you know all there right in just a block or two but she's still real independent so oh she drives yeah i think that for so many people that uh the nursing home represent obviously different uh different things and depending on the level of function whereas my you know my grandmother doesn't need need any extra uh camaraderie or anything like that because she gets it from her church or from her friends that come by but uh i've seen a lot of people that don't live near their family or don't have you know significant roots in this in their little community they've been uprooted for some reason or another and they i i think that it would be good for them to be into a situation that would offer them uh oh activities to maintain an active mind because like you say if you just put them in the house and keep them there all day long and they they become they vegetate and that's oh yeah they've got nothing or they get on the telephone all day long but i mean this is one area where i'd like to see social security or the government step in an d take people over a certain age or with handicaps or something and take their social security away from them i mean give them you know money at a certain point and putting them in homes to where they can get something fed back to them in other words people talk to and become still human beings uh-huh because you see people down in south Dallas and every where else sitting in a house they don't know anybody they're scared to death of robbers they're scared to death of everything uh-huh they hardly have enough food to even eat on i meant they're not living and that's not living right right exactly exactly yeah i mean hey i'm putting all this money out to the government why can't they put it out there rather than in the federal prisons um yeah they but you know you see pictures on TV i mean i wish i had enough money to go down there and do something but you know i don't know they if they can have day care why can't they put elderly people care and put them in a home to where it's regulated yeah i mean it's it's a shame that we have this to where it's we don't think of our older people we really don't oh no i mean look at the uh Orientals they protect respect uh they conserve their elderly for for what they are they're a true natural resource and they cherish them and uh yet i mean we as Americans are such a throw away society that we've basically done that with generations of people that have so called outlived their usefulness you know i i think that's uh an atrocity and i'm fortunate enough that i've had uh my relatives have lived very long full lives and uh or most of them have and as a result i have uh i've been you know  okay okay what can we do about crime i don't know the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they're they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people and they keep letting out people that have you know these horrible records uh-huh so maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something that's one thing i guess i could think of um-hum uh it's definitely a big concern i mean every day it's you know all are even we live in a little small town and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live yeah so it's pretty scary well i i'm i'm from Butler and i can't say that there's too much of that there um um-hum i know the bigger cities have problems with it yeah uh i really don't know what we can do about it yeah it's rough because unless they start enforcing the um uh start giving more people death sentences that's the only thing i could think of yeah yeah well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous i mean you hear about people you know six and seven times have committed burglaries and they're still you know only serving six months in prison so that's definitely something they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like you know from one month to ten years or something um-hum that would be one thing that you know i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties you know for certain crimes yeah yeah i i don't i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse yeah and one things that they're saying now are you going are you a student or are you in the work force or um i'm a senior at Clarion University oh okay because one of the things that i've heard so much about lately um lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much and apparently many of the especially like in date rape many of the um you know perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up and they don't really well not only that a lot of them's not even turned in oh yeah you know what i mean a lot of times the girls don't even report it yeah yeah um i've heard of a few cases up here but i can't say that i've heard of uh you know any significant amount uh but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not yeah yeah they say like only one in ten are reported i believe it um-hum that's it's awful so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing but i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing you know for people to report it so that's probably something else they could do um-hum yeah i don't know it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs you know and that's like as long as it it almost makes me feel in a way like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have you know because these kids are saying why should i go do you want to sit down to high school and so i can go out and work at Burger King you know for four dollars an hour or whatever when i can make uh four hundred dollars a day selling drugs so that's certainly a big problem i don't know what the solution to that is having more drug treatment centers available jeez i don't know uh see see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything i know a lot of people yeah that partake in that and i'm not saying they're bad people but i i i would say that's a bigger problem yeah because it ends up even if it's just kind of like this social drug use you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin you know huge amounts thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent you know on higher and higher up on drugs and it's definitely um-hum got to do with crime you know you hear about people selling their babies you know to get some crack i mean just oh gosh horrible stuff like that one of the things they're doing is is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack uh-huh they said um some of the statistics statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack and their moms are crack users so that's you know another way of looking at it as as the woman is being a criminal you know for doing that to her child uh-huh so i don't know who's the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted and it's a very complicated problem i don't envy the government trying to cope with it gosh no i don't either yeah well i guess that's about all i have to say is there anything else you would want to uh no i can't say that i i just know that it's really bad in some areas and something's going to have to be done sooner but okay yeah i don't i don't know what they can do yeah yeah it's frustrating um-hum well it was nice talking to you uh you too bye okay well thanks for talking have a good day bye bye  what are your favorite programs uh it's kind of hard to put my finger on a on a favorite TV program however uh one that i've been watching for a number of years is Dallas and uh oh how funny and uh it's going to be going off the air uh let's see a week from Friday a week from tonight it's going to be its last show so i've i've kind of enjoyed watching over the years i've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it and uh i was uh greatly disappointed uh when i did move down to Plano to uh find out that the uh the uh great South Fork Ranch was really only a one bedroom house i've seen the sign that goes to there i've well i think i've seen it in the distance um-hum but i have not even seen it and i have not seen the program oh well that's a shame so and and uh i know when we went to London it was really funny uh people recognized Dallas Texas by the the Texas uh the the Cowboys and by that program um-hum yes and that's that's the two things they associate with Dallas Texas so i and i they asked me several several times they ask me why are there two bridges and i didn't know what they were talking about it took me a long time they're talking about the viaducts um-hum is that that is right isn't it yeah because they ask me why are there two bridges going into Dallas darned if i know i was blank looking you know i felt really dumb well it it's uh when you look at the uh you know route seventy five coming down there i i mean it's actually a bridge but it's a bridge over top of roadway there's no water there i mean uh well there's water in the Trinity i thought it was to going to Oak Cliff over the Trinity yeah well there's there um well they i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of Dallas one from the east and one from the west oh do they oh and that's why oh i see uh it kind of confuses people but uh uh i enjoy a a a lot of different comedies um i think it's mainly for an escape um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that uh are on the air some are just purely you know brain drainers uh-huh and then there's other ones that uh deal with uh in a funny manner uh socially relevant things and uh one show that comes to mind is like Designing Women i think that is just a hoot that's one of those few that i do watch and the television is on my husband likes to watch TV it's on um yeah i usually read and watch TV um-hum and usually i can handle both at the same time you know because i am pretty sure where the TV plot's going yeah um-hum but that's one of the few that i just actually watch because it's funny yes i really enjoy that one yes it uh it has been very entertaining and and also uh the the issues they deal with uh really tends to open open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems and uh i've i've really enjoyed that one since it came on um don't like the politics surrounding the program though but i mean other than that you know there seems to be a little fighting in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses but uh and then uh i've kind of gotten hooked on PBS stuff uh public uh TV uh i like things like Nova and uh some of the the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff i just enjoy watching that stuff now we watch a lot of those uh and the ones that sometimes will hook me to put down my book will be the one there was one uh recently about the Gettysburg Address um-hum and they wrapped a fictional story around it uh-huh and i thought that was well done um-hum and and it it caught my attention i wound up watching the whole thing um i guess the awards ceremonies and there seems to be dozens of them per year maybe i've spent two minutes watching to see what they have on and if they make a fool of themselves or not but uh they could take that whole collection and it would disappear and i'd never miss it for a minute yeah particularly the beauty pageants i i particularly take issue with those i i really dislike those well i'm one of those rare guys who i i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event um if ever watch one uh there's just not that much i'm i'm interested in um for a while i i i watched some football but i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and and watch a baseball game you know my husband used to just be riveted to the Dallas Cowboys and now we're out running around and if they're if they're playing he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is and he'll listen but even i've said hey look you're fascinated with this you sit and listen to the Cowboys let me run in here and i'll do some things and i'll come back and you don't have to miss he'll say nah nah nah and he doesn't he doesn't watch it he listen like i say if it's convenient he'll listen to it um-hum but he just doesn't watch them on TV like he used to well i think it was great when they were you know like world champs and they were doing real well i uh i personally i i came from the Washington area and so i was a big Washington Redskins fan oh oh those people yeah and uh when i came down to Dallas it was uh you know i found myself rooting for the home team i uh in fact i have a uh a baseball hat that was signed by Tony Dorsett and Hershel Walker oh how neat the only year they played together on the Dallas Cowboys well i actually got to go see them win in the Super Bowl when they went down to New Orleans yeah oh wow and i i i made the trip and did the whole New Orleans before the game and the game and everything and uh that was hm that was a lot of fun but yeah i don't know i haven't been as i'll tell you what i love to watch and this is not this is rarely on television but what is a lot of fun to go attend is this arena football yeah i like it's so much better than straight football hm no i haven't seen that it it doesn't it has a lot of different rules the field is half the size um-hum um-hum and there's no they can't call time and things like that it moves a lot faster uh gee i'll have to try to catch that sometime if uh again i think it may be on cable more than anything else we don't have cable yeah that's proba bly true yeah we don't either i uh i couldn't rationalize paying you know it's like if i pay for a movie channel then i have to watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them and if i you know if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic well i can get that for free and well i don't really don't need CNN i see enough bad news all the time i don't need to see more of it so i i've kind of uh rationalized that it's it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see well and of course when we were living in Texas it was real convenient with Tom Thumb you know having movies uh back then it was ninety nine cents i mean go oh they're everywhere they're on every corner everything you've ever wanted to see yeah and you can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like HBO or Cinemax well and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that um-hum or it becomes snack time for various reasons you can put you know the only thing this Dance with Wolves i want to see it in a theater yeah oh yes i do too because i understand that that your you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't yeah and i i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it she she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty and uh you know she just doesn't like them and um she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie and i've told her you know everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick that's what i hear too and uh so i'm i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon well my husband smokes he's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes and you can't smoke in movie theaters hm and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies but i haven't really cared up until this point but i we are this weekend going to go see Dance with Wolves it's that's it we will do it um that's great so yeah finally yeah but as as far as uh regular TV shows i mean i've got some some shows that i that that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched and then there's there's others that uh uh i i wish i had time to see it's like i enjoy watching Cheers it's very funny some of the things in it are mindless but i i just don't have time to watch it um i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the TV set all night long probably is on Monday nights and because um i work so hard over the weekend doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on Monday Monday night i'm just worn out so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and and look over things and i can sit in front of the TV set and look at you know do go through my mail and and watch TV at the same time well i tend my job tends to be very demanding um-hum and to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to  okay Jay where do you live in Texas i live in Dallas um in Dallas right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state and a uh that goes east and west and a north south tollway what's that the I-30 and Central Express it's no it's called 635's the highway it's the looper that goes around the city and then uh the tollway is called the Dallas North Tollway just moved here about uh okay yeah right yeah oh uh one about a month ago after twenty one years two miles to the east oh is that right oh how about that so it's a very different house from the typical Dallas uh house it's a new home it's about eight years old it's uh it's a duplex type thing uh very modern and um very open and airy light about eight years oh uh-huh so it's different than those than the long Texas ramblers um-hum right uh-huh well we we live in a brick story and a half um what's your house like Cape Cod style i guess you'd call it and uh a big oh great yeah sun room on the back of it it so it's got a lot a openness openness openness and light also no have oh it doesn't well that's what my wife really wanted and so uh with openness and light i understand that i would love that too yeah that's uh our our last house wasn't too bad but it was just too traditional and so if uh uh-huh yeah this is very traditional the next the next time uh probably a year and a half from now we're gonna try to build uh-huh so make one really um contemporary and and very modern and very open and very light uh-huh do you have children at home no i have three in college they they usually get back for the least two of them for the summer so three oh boy you still need space plenty of space but still need a little bit of space we we have a lot less than we had uh recently already cut back uh-huh huh uh-huh well how big is your place it's uh oh about twenty five thousand twenty five hundred square feet i guess oh that's good size it's four bedrooms and two baths yeah we we had and that it has one wing built on it's a kitchen family room and then uh big room on the back yeah we had four bedrooms two and a half baths uh in the place we just left um uh-huh so down now we're down to two and two two and two uh-huh um-hum so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home but it won't be that long because we not for sure you know how long they're gonna stay or whatever right uh-huh i was just reading an article um that there were nineteen thousand properties available in Texas uh for sale by the Resolution Resolution Trust Company Corporation repossessed oh yes yes and if you can get in the if if if you can find one in the right area you can really pick up a steal i i guess so uh we we really didn't go that route and didn't look uh but um the plenty of them and the and the housing market probably still gonna even go lower there are many many houses just for sale just by the regular route uh-huh so um that's discouraging if you own property yeah and we just decided uh uh sell and we got we got a pretty good price uh for for what we had uh not as good as it would've been few years say three or four years ago but uh-huh that um that was just the timing right well our daughter and son-in-law moved up back up here he's from Texas but course she's from here um about a year and a half ago um-hum and had their house on the market down there and they never did sell it so they stayed six months and she got her job back and he got a job down there because oh well yeah they're not moving very well for sure huh-uh no and that's a good uh example of it they live in Rowlett oh yeah i know where that is i've been we've been here twenty five years i'm from Missouri and my wife's from Kansas so have you uh-huh i teach i teach at a college here so it's uh it's sort of home now uh-huh so what college are you teaching at i'm uh uh one of the Brookhaven uh it's called Brookhaven College it's one of the community colleges oh and it's just about two miles to the west of where i'm living so it's very nice very convenient uh-huh only one i know is Richardson yeah now Richland College is out it serves Richardson and uh Garland and that's about nine miles to the east of here so uh Garland uh-huh yeah anyway well it's good to hear from you and i hope we hope we did them some good uh on their little computer dealie and uh well enjoyed talking to you i hope so right uh have a good life the rest of it bye-bye okay thank you same to you bye-bye  are you a TIer uh yeah i am yeah yeah i've been uh oh good yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one o'clock on Friday i uh it is Friday yeah that's for sure well uh i guess i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid oh wow okay uh so and my father and brother were in it and and my brother's still in it and i had periods when i didn't do anything but in the last ten years i've uh my car doesn't go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh there's hardly anything that other than putting tires on that i'll do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and uh-huh yeah sure uh uh i just essentially do it all i don't know uh uh if there's anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess that's diversion uh uh-huh right right i i've i've tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because i've heard when i used to go there yeah yeah and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didn't take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right right you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that right and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there yeah yeah i was pretty impressed with Western Auto but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didn't like it So i'm just doing it all myself i i really yeah that's that's the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so i've got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh i've done you had to do it yeah right i've done various things i've got an i've got an eighty three T Bird and i've i've changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um oh uh-huh um i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car um when we went in for inspection it didn't it didn't quite pass so we had to have uh that's uh that's a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it uh-huh yeah uh-huh they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh oh yeah well you like Fords apparently huh yeah yeah i've uh i'm kind of stuck on them right now i guess but you know that's it's partially because i can work on them that's uh that's that's that's a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh yeah having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh and they had left the uh oil filter uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that little little things like that that really start to aggravate you that that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff really my goodness yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we don't inspect i'm in facilities why we don't inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh um-hum we always fix things and put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned there ought to be an inspector inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didn't put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh sure sure that's right sure yeah any anything that gets that that's in uh gets to be an an assembly line type operation you're you're always risking that if there's too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things they're you get you you miss that overlap sometimes and and they miss things yeah i've i've had a hard time yeah finding anybody i can trust like like you say it my old transmissions things like that i'm obviously i'm not going to i'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission try rebuild it no no i don't either i don't either yeah but uh it it's it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of what's going on yeah you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which uh-huh okay i worked my way into having the same engine i don't know how long i'm i like a V8 and i'm i'm sold sold on small block Chevy V8s and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally yeah oh yeah yeah got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used a used car with the same engine uh-huh well then the next the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V8 sure sure uh-huh and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i there's no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know uh-huh well yeah that that the biggest you know that's the three biggest things to me you know i i number one you've got to have the tools around if you don't have the the special tools or yeah well any more the the testers that you know i i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts yeah right my car start missing or something like that that it's almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if it's if it's under carriage or something like that but yeah then it's experience you know you can you can look through a a Chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it but you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so yeah just just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart yeah that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i yeah i think they're all bad really they're yeah yeah the the only ones i've ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh uh-huh is that right i i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh yeah what did they want to charge you for it oh it it was it was tremendous well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so yeah yeah and they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside yeah yeah yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it yeah and it last it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and it it's a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not yeah uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally through yeah did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings maybe you're right maybe you're right i it's been a long time since i took one out yeah it it's i i've never heard a good story about uh course i broke mine you know so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it i don't know whether you did yours yeah not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off right okay very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and i've always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time yeah uh-huh sure but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well i'm going to to going to carefully take those hoses off you bet well that that's what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasn't busted but the it wasn't soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where oh really yeah if it got hot It it spread out yeah and and not just normal driving didn't do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside yeah yeah it was real aggravating but uh i i couldn't even even a week's a week's time is is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it yeah sometimes if you're a tinkerer you luck out My wife's uh-huh uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in uh-huh and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by it's not the evaporator the big filter on one side uh-huh i just pushed that in and i heard it click yeah and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressor's not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity right that's true and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know that's tough if you don't uh at least give it a shot i've got girls daughters and uh-huh i've always said i'd teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really haven't gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And i'm going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year yeah i said This summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said so you can learn the basics you know well yeah and and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation yeah without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble right i have the there's one expression i don't like uh the country expression you know if it ain't if it ain't broke don't fix it  all right you want to start out well it'll be real easy for us because we're both my husband and i are vegetarians so yeah so that's the first thing we look for is if we can eat there or not oh are you really oh are you strict vegetarians we're not vegan vegetarians we do we're ovolacto we do eat uh eggs and and milk products i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian where i didn't eat any animal products at all uh-huh um-hum um-hum but um it was it's really difficult in the area if you don't have you know the products that you can get and if you go out to dinner there's virtually you know there's not a whole lot of things you can get there's very few places that you i'll bet that you could uh yeah i think maybe if you were somewhere like California where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants and stuff but here basically you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant you know where you can get foods that uh-huh um-hum you know where you have a little bit more variety as far as the pastas or the the corn meal you know or something um-hum yeah and you wouldn't have the meat products in that and some but yeah yeah you have to watch that too all you know some of the restaurants here they will you know like you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or you know animal fat to cook with yeah uh-huh uh-huh so but so that's that we don't really eat out too much we we tend to eat at home and actually you know i think we we we get a have we have a healthier diet than the average person yeah uh-huh how long have you been doing this um i've been a vegetarian for uh two years now my husband has been one for oh just over a year now and uh so uh-huh do you feel that it has improved the way you feel definitely and it it makes you more aware of what you're eating because you you have to be i mean you you i think you you think um-hum um-hum you you balance the foods uh you know you're more aware of what nutrient you know value each thing has and minerals and you're just more aware of food for energy for energy sake um-hum um-hum i always thought it would be be hard to figure out what to eat if you were a vegetarian how how well that's just it you you do have to figure it out and and you know to get proteins and things and when i was a vegan it's you know you have to consider calcium and iron and things like that you you're not even getting through your milk products your egg products yeah um-hum uh-huh because you don't eat any of those things if you don't eat any of those but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables i mean there are there are there are you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products a lot of people don't know that well the thing is that milk products our bodies don't uh is that right uh-huh don't uh the the lactose that kind of milk it doesn't our we we tend to uh what's it called we don't synthesize the the calcium the same way uh-huh we throw more of it off our body out other words yeah we we slough some of it we we send we send some of it out because it our body doesn't accept some of it um-hum so we're not utilizing we're when it when it gets rid of some of that um that we can't use it get rids it gets rid of some of the calcium um-hum whereas we eat say broccoli you utilize all of it you utilize your your body accepts all of the broccoli um-hum all that's in it uh-huh so it's like it's like say a person using vitamins as opposed to uh vitamin supplements as opposed to eating regular food why uh-huh your body just doesn't accept vitamins and the minerals in the the vitamins in uh-huh uh supplements that it does in regular food you know so but we both we both feel much healthier much healthier and i couldn't consider going back to eating that's interesting uh-huh after you have been on this yeah well now i changed for ethical reasons and my husband yeah uh-huh has changed he feels more ethically about it but he he in the beginning began for health reasons um-hum but um now he he feels like i do that he looks at the things that he eats and he realizes what they are before he eats them and he you know uh-huh uh-huh he thinks more about them then yeah plus he eats we both think more about i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating um-hum you know as far as a living creature and now we both think a lot of well what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies too so um-hum um-hum so you kind of have a combination um-hum yeah uh-huh now see we i live in a farming community um-hum so of course we have a lot of animals and that type of thing raised in our area well we do too i mean i was raised in um we're in cattle country and people here buy a half a cow and put it in their freezer you know and that um-hum um-hum oh yeah yeah that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but uh-huh you know i suppose if you really believe in something it's you you adjust your life because your mind you your you inside yourself you just it's not right you get adjusted to the taste um-hum um-hum um-hum so but um um-hum so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most oh yes most people would yeah now we wouldn't have that problem because we're not vegetarians so what do you look for when you uh i think the main thing that i look for is uh cleanliness uh you know the in the appearance of the people that work there and the uh quality of the food that they serve uh-huh do you normally when you're traveling do you look for places that's established that that you've been to before or are you willing to try new places if oh we try new places but when we a lot of times we do eat where we know yeah like a chain restaurant or something what um-hum what the quality because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop um-hum and uh we do do that a lot and i guess i'm getting old older also i like to be served i like to sit down and have my uh order taken as opposed to like a cafeteria kind of right situation yeah so i suppose you'd say i well i i don't know whether it's age or what it is but i have well no i don't think so i think it's just your because i i prefer to be waited on too i just if you're going to go out to eat why not have the whole service you know why why not get the whole yeah yeah i guess because we don't go out that much i feel like it's a treat um-hum you should feel have a treat and i like the light meals not all restaurants have light meals on their menu yeah uh-huh you know and i oh light menu you mean like cooked light or uh L I T E like uh uh things that aren't as heavy a meal oh i see uh-huh it that you get more uh fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as uh they're not breaded and they're not fried and they're not not a lot of gravy and things like that you know i i like those too i like those too because uh some seems like sometimes it's yeah uh but not all restaurants uh-huh you order a meal you order their dinner meal and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat or or i know it's too much yes or or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain and maybe they're afraid that people are going to complain or something i um-hum i don't know what it is but now for instance we we had a Scout dinner last night we went to and it's it's they uh well they'll serve you at your seat and usually usually the salad bar is included so you have to get up for that but they have so much food that you not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself you end up eating much more than you need uh-huh and i think that's a shame i mean i must admit sometimes i do like a buffet but uh but i think that they just tend to make you you say oh well i've have got all i can eat or or you know it's one of these situations where uh-huh uh-huh nobody's going to restrain what you eat the amount that you eat and i think that people that we just tend to eat overeat yeah um-hum uh-huh yeah you can eat as much as you want and you like the food you know yeah uh a lot of times the foods like uh Haas's carry a bread bar that is just out of this world and you know you and soup and uh they just and fruit and vegetables and they they just yeah i don't know that you i know i always overeat no matter i go with good intentions but i somehow along the way when i come back to my seat i have too much and i eat it because it's so good yeah well at least it's fruit and stuff there maybe it's not too bad yeah and i like reasonable prices of course too i don't like to you know go to anything that's real expensive yeah i think that's a waste of my money just for food it does seem like it um-hum um-hum yeah but uh we like uh we do like international food so we tend to i like cooking we like Indian food and uh i love Italian food and so do you uh-huh uh-huh uh Chinese uh Chinese we've got a good Chinese restaurant in town i i really like eating there and yeah and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems yeah you know you can eat a whole big plate of their food and you really don't feel like you've eaten too much yeah you're full you know you're satisfied but you don't feel stuffed and miserable yeah yeah that's one thing that i wish we had more of uh because where we're from it's it's pretty limited and it's most of the restaurants are oh they tend to be you know American style food and we don't have too many where you have to go all the way to Dallas um-hum um and so really is a treat because uh you know we don't make a trip sixty five eighty you know sixty five to eighty miles depending how far in Dallas it is so yeah yeah  okay so well what have you had done recently to your automobile that you're just really excited about really depressed is a better word i actually it's being done as right now as we speak um-hum i had uh i guess that's something i could kick myself about i uh and i guess this all started with a leaky water uh pump and uh let the engine get overheated and uh right now they're pulling the heads off my engine and uh having to do uh replace the head and the exhaust manifold and so forth it's uh oh that's major major isn't it oh about five hundred dollars worth so far i guess around is that all in there oh yeah well now this certainly isn't something that you could do yourself is it or would want too um well it some people could probably do it themselves uh i'm not one of those um-hum yeah i'm not about the only thing i can do mechanically with a a car is put gas in it are you i know how to take care of it but i wouldn't attempt to do anything although i did used to try and change the oil yeah well actually i did start i did some things myself when i before i found out what the problem was or how serious it was i tried a few things like changing the spark plugs and um-hum pulling the PCV valve out checking uh some of the things that might have been wrong um-hum i do you know some minor stuff but i don't really like to do uh car work all that much um-hum i'd rather do woodworking oh that's more interesting would i would think yeah yeah i had the uh brakes changed on my car and what went in what i went in for i thought was rather a routine um not real expensive but you know maybe expensive but it turned out to be a four hundred dollar brake job wow and they they work okay but the noise is so loud there's such a whirring noise and they tell me that that should have gone away in two hundred miles but i yeah you should of you should of never been there to begin with i don't know i would suspect really well i've still got it after about seven hundred and i'm taking it back in next week um especially for four hundred bucks but well i didn't know see that's part of the problem you if you're not aware and um and you just uh you know you just never know and you know you feel like you're getting taken of advantage of a lot of times i agree um i i guess you know the money has to be spent and that car has to be taken care of but you would hope that uh people would be a little bit more honest with you i guess maybe the key there is to get more than one estimate but i i get so tired tired of having to run here and run there you know yeah that's not easy to do too because uh you know a lot of them will pull it apart and start on it and then they want to then they add things on to it or whatever you can't always get an estimate i guess um-hum that's very true well i guess we've kind of covered the topic huh car repair we could go on for days huh current yeah i'm afraid so more than they want to hear yeah so well i hope you have good luck getting yours fixed yeah i'll uh i uh i hope so too i've got uh my fingers crossed i was expecting that i might hear something this afternoon but not so far and uh uh-huh okay but we shall see have a nice weekend thank you very much and the same to you bye-bye um-hum okay good talking with you bye  okay the i guess the latest one that we've seen is uh Awakening with uh yeah that's with uh uh Awakening i haven't heard of that one oh the guy that plays Mark uh Robin Williams and he played a terrific part in that uh-huh huh but uh that's one of the better ones we've seen in in the last oh i guess the last six months yeah we just saw uh Flatliners last night that was really good Flatliners i want i never did get to see that oh that's a good movie yeah this uh Awakening i think is is something along the same lines it's got some yeah it's uh about a doctor uh and it's a true story uh-huh uh there was a bunch of people that were uh they first of all they they thought they had Parkinson Parkinson's disease uh-huh they would tremble first start trembling real bad but then they would just go almost go into a coma huh and uh they they could tell that they were responding that they could hear you uh-huh but it was just a blank stare you got and they were just almost frozen in in in a position huh and they tried some uh tried some drugs and then all of a sudden that one summer uh the drug that they gave them brought them out of their coma and that's where they got the word awakening uh-huh uh-huh but then they lapsed back into the coma but uh and Robert DeNiro played the uh played i guess uh the co-lead part he was one of the ones that were in a coma uh-huh when did this movie come out oh it's been out i guess now for or a month and a half or something like that huh i haven't heard about that one but if you get a chance see that i also want to see uh that uh Sleeping With The Enemy or Silence of the Lambs oh that's a great a movie yeah we went to see that i've heard that that's good oh that's awesome yeah yeah if you don't you don't mind the the gross parts of it yeah well i heard it's not really that that uh gross it's not like Friday the 13th or something like that yeah uh-huh oh yeah just the subtle kind of stuff though yeah yeah yeah it uh Flatliners is a real good movie too i recommend renting that yeah it's got some uh interesting things about it because you know you know what the plot is basically that they kill themselves and come back yeah but they they're trying to experience uh life after death yeah then when they come back all sorts of strange things start happening to them yeah we don't see as many movies as we used to um-hum uh we got a VCR so we go to Blockbuster video place and rent the movies yeah that's what i i just did today i got uh Darkman have you seen that uh i haven't i'll guess i'll watch it tonight huh-uh yeah there was another good movie that Robin Williams played in uh that really surprised me it was uh Dead Poets Society oh yeah i liked that one that was good uh but it uh it's not typical Robin Williams i you know i expected some comedy or something like that but he he's a good dramatic actor actor when he wants to be um-hum um yep so what other movies have you rented recently uh that Awakening i guess is the last movie we've been to in a couple months like i say we we uh our son one of our sons gave us for Christmas some Blockbuster uh gift certificates uh-huh huh and uh we just go up and find some old movies that we haven't seen yeah uh some of the old classics what kind of movies are you into mostly uh some some some of the like the uh Agatha Agatha Christie uh movies Murder On Orient Express and some of the others yeah yeah that's a good one course the new releases they're i don't know what the rule is now but i think they had i don't know if it's a year or what before they put them on uh VCR so you can rent them yeah yeah it's about a year actually i just uh they just put one out that's only been out for um a half a year it seems yeah but there's a couple out that i would i'd like to see i want to see that Silence of the Lambs i want to see uh uh Sleeping With the Enemy um-hum yeah i haven't seen that and uh i can't remember some of the others oh we went and rented uh Field of Dreams yeah have you seen that one yeah that was good yeah Kevin Costner yeah it was okay but uh yeah i like nature movies too i like used to be uh Walt Disney would put out what they called True Life Adventures i'm not much into baseball yeah like like have you seen The Bear yeah i saw The Bear that was good that's pretty good when the bear comes up and attacks them scares the hell out of them yeah yeah but some of the old ones that he put out like uh The Living Desert uh-huh and uh oh there were several i can't remember them all but he would the show the animals and everything that live in a particular region or whatever um-hum i remember he done one on the desert and he done one on the prairie uh but i i like True Life Adventures um yeah so does my girlfriend hm yeah she's she's um a veterinarian i'm not i'm not much for the for the gory Friday The 13ths and and Nightmare On Elm Street and all that other stuff uh yeah that's what my sisters like now i do like a good mystery you know like Psycho or something like that but not the gory where they just all they show is blood and guts they get a yeah um-hum yeah i never did see that uh one that won uh so many Academy Awards that uh the one Kevin Costner Costner directed and starred in which one was that the um about the Indian uh Dance With Wolves or something like that The Wolves oh yeah yeah that's pretty good that's a very good movie i didn't see that i've heard some people say it's good and some people say it's they didn't like it course i guess you you can get that on any kind of movie you see yeah um-hum a long movie though yeah i heard it's over three hours long but uh plus movies cost so much now unless you go to the early movie yeah that's true down here i don't know what costs you up there but down here man and wife you're going to spend if you for your tickets and any popcorn and cold drink you're going to spend close to fifteen dollars that's about what it is here too those three dollar drinks three dollar popcorn yeah and that they're awfully small too yeah and uh it used to be the candy counter and stuff would have the small bars but now all they have is the big old family size bars oh yeah so yeah i just got some free passes for movies because i'm graduating yeah so i can use those where where are you attending school NC State NC State yeah graduating Computer Science how'd y'all do in basketball this year oh we did pretty good yeah oh y'all usually always have a good basketball yeah next year we're not going to have anybody though because all our seniors are leaving hum yeah well this is football country down here yeah although Arkansas had a pretty good basketball team uh-huh yeah as always but uh well well i was trying to think of something else i i do miss uh i'm i'm fifty seven years old and you don't sound like you're that old uh-huh no twenty two but uh i remember when i was a kid kid and you'd go to the movies and you got to see a movie and usually a double feature um-hum you got to see a newsreel um-hum and usually a serial like Flash Gordon or or uh Zorro or something like that line um-hum and then a cartoon at least one cartoon sometimes two cartoons yeah and you could spend almost all afternoon at the movie just watching movies and other stuff but now it it's the movie and the previews and that's about it and the ads and the ads throw a Coke ad in there yeah but a lot of times we would go to the movies just to see the cartoons and the serial um-hum because you always wondered how can the guy get out of this and then the next yeah cliffhangers and the next week you'd find out how he got out of it cliffhanger and into something else yeah but uh okay well i enjoyed talking with you all right and good luck in your schooling yeah okay have a good day bye-bye bye all right bye  okay do you exercise every night or not no i do it in spurts do you yes and i've i should do it on a regular basis but uh for some reason i think it's tough to get into a a particular routine yeah i i'm on uh a right now i'm on one of those jags where i i exercise at well i i run every night oh and uh i just i was surprised i could run i didn't think i could i thought well i maybe a half a block i can run but i have really amazed myself but what i do i walk oh about a half a mile and i walk uphill yeah um-hum and then i run all the way back down by the time i get down to my street i've worked up a pretty good momentum and i can just keep right on running until i get home and uh i'm not right now i just got through doing it so i'm a little bit out of breath i'm really not as winded as i would thought thought i was going to be oh a very appropriate topic then yes sure it was fantastic i think gosh i just got back got in from running and i thought well i'll place this call real quick yeah yeah but i have a little dog i run with so i'm and she's getting old i don't know if i probably not good for her but it's good for me i think it's probably as good for her anyway yeah i think so they're they're natural i do a lot of uh hunting oh do you and have a bird dog and i enjoy watching that dog run more than i do anything yeah aren't they pretty i not they are they're just beautiful and the native instinct that they have is just amazing to watch uh-huh is it a pointer or it's a setter um-hum setter yeah i think they're the prettiest yeah that's a good combination pet and hunting dog both i had a a Greyhound i was race i was running with but uh oh my you are ambitious he was i found i just i tried uh i finally had to give her back to the Greyhound Association she was just too big for me she she weighed seventy pounds and uh if she would run with me you know and stay with me but if she saw something she wanted if she wanted to get away she could have she would have drug me i mean when i walked with her people you know would laugh because she drug me when i tried to walk right and when i tried to run i was afraid she'd really take out running and just have and they can run i think uh forty miles an hour and uh gosh uh she got away from me a couple of times and so i'd rather run with a little Pekingese any old day they're my my more my style yeah are so you just run in your neighborhood yeah yeah i'm i'm too chicken to get out any place else yeah i do you belong to a health club no no i've i've done some of that and the YMCA and other types of things too uh oh have you i just don't enjoy running i i enjoy walking fast and with hand weights and things like that but yeah oh okay well that might be my i have a walking tape i use i bought me a little head set you know and a little walking tape which really helps but but i wanted to run for some reason and you know and i i didn't really think i could yeah uh-huh because i i remember years ago when i tried my side would hurt real bad and everything but i i'm on a health kick i've decided uh my cholesterol was high and my triglyceride's high so i've i've uh done that and i'm on uh i everybody says i don't need to lose weight but i feel i must so i'm going to try to lose ten pounds and i've lost four of it so i'm really oh good yeah running there's no question that running will will get your attention as far as uh weight control but yeah and i do it every night except for i i do volunteer work at the hospital one night a week so i don't do it that night but the other uh six days a week i run hum do you run with anyone no just my dog yeah i had a neighbor across the street that was going with me but she can't run because she said her ankles hurt or her knees or something and so i uh what i do i'll walk with her up the top hill and let her take my dog and then i run home um-hum if she's home she's a flight attendant so she's not home very often and so when she's home i run with her but her walk with her but but do you do you have that feeling of boredom sometimes in running or i would if i didn't have this radio on my head yeah i i think i in fact i haven't been using my walking tape since i've been running i've been using just my radio and if i didn't have that to go but i have to what i do is i have to set goals for myself i say okay i'm going to make it to the end of that block and then when i get there i'm going okay i've got to make i just go a block at a time yeah if i didn't i i i don't think i could make it and i need feel that running you know three and four mile i don't think i could do it i could you know i a mile is real and it may not even be a mile i'm running it feels it looks like a mile to me but it may not be um well you ought to get in the car and measure it one day yeah i think i think i will this weekend i but i'm almost afraid to i'm afraid that it's oh all this for nothing you know oh i could go a little bit further but i just don't you know golly i'm not a spring chicken any more and i don't want to have to my daughter got after me she said now you are taking identification with you and i said no i'm just in the neighborhood she says well mother what if a car should jump the the road and hit you or what if you stumbled and fell and knocked yourself out and they wouldn't know who you were your your daughter is wise we had a i said well she is smart you know we had a friend uh who was jogging and passed out and collapsed and had a heart attack and fell over and they took him to the hospital and it took a while to to find out who he was and where oh yeah um-hum yeah i realized she was right after that so now i uh i carry a little ID with me that shows who i where i live anyway and i put my daughter's telephone number for emergencies so um-hum yeah you know Nancy i think there are a lot of uh people now who are paying more attention to uh physical fitness and i think it's a good idea yeah i oh i do too and i go religiously for a check up every year and uh my triglycerides were three hundred and sixty five now this what makes me mad i'm i i don't eat beef i don't use salt i watch my diet all the time and i uh it was three sixty five it's supposed to be a hundred and fifty my cholesterol was two hundred and thirty five well i've gotten that down to a hundred and ninety and my triglycerides have come down to two seventy three but they told me that it takes about three months for triglycerides to come down so it's coming down and uh-huh and i think this and exercise and really watching your diet does it i've been on that diet that what's that Tommy Lasorda thing uh diet oh uh yeah i know what you um-hum ultra fast ultra slim ultra yeah slim fast that's it i've been doing that and it's not too bad uh i don't need right have you tried niacin huh have you tried niacin no but i'll tell you what i'm doing i'm doing the uh omega fish fish oil calcium lecithin lecithin um-hum oat bran uh vitamin B6 have you tried oat bran no but i'll that's my next step i'm okay my wife uh went on that on a very strict basis and it really brought everything down um-hum uh-huh did it well they they say that the nurse at works said the uh the fish oil would uh bring it down and the lecithin is supposed to bring your cholesterol down um-hum so and my doctor really was more concerned with uh my triglycerides but he said well my God Nancy no wonder you you have high triglycerides look how look how your weight's jumped and it jumped seven pounds in one year i'm you'd think i was i'm a a size eight i said that's not fat i know you know logically that is not fat but i do realize i need to to lose some weight but um-hum well i think keeping in in physical shape helps the mental shape too oh i do too absolutely and i feel so much better about myself when i you know get into good shape when i lived in Orlando i went to weight watchers and i i went from a size twelve to a size six in three months yeah do you play tennis or golf or anything no i'm not real sporty yeah years ago i used to play tennis but i'm so bad i ended up you know just chasing the ball all the time i'd like to do tennis again but uh but yeah i enjoy that and that and i i think i use that as a phase of of my exercise program yeah well that's good exercise do you exercise uh do you play tennis very often uh when it gets warm yes yes oh do you now see i'll quit running when it gets warm when it gets hot i know there's no way i'll get out in that heat and run or even walk right oh i'll probably balloon up early morning and late evening yeah it'll it'll have to be well you know early morning is a good time i know but then you have to go to work all uh i shower at night but i i may just have to change my schedule yeah early in the morning about five in the morning five thirty in the morning when it first gets yeah uh-huh oh very very comfortable then right isn't yeah that's what i'll have to do and i'm really scared to go out at night after dark oh yes yes i not in this day and time and you know when i grew up it was different but nowadays you i wouldn't i i'm not foolish enough to do that well i see people with mace and and other things yeah is that is that your dog calling you to go running again yes she doesn't like me on the telephone she's so jealous okay so well it's been nice talking to you and uh it certainly has and good luck keep it up you too bye-bye bye  okay you've do you have a uh monthly budget uh-huh well um we we do but not an official one i mean basically we know we have i i think i'm a little crazy in that we keep so many different savings accounts uh-huh uh-huh we'll have our checking account that's just the the money that we use and spend right and then we have a savings account which is money where we work our credit cards in such a way that we charge everything and then we write it out like it was a check uh-huh so we're never we pay off our bills in full we're not paying any interest but it's not a big surprise if we get a large bill because we have it all written out already right and then we have another checking account another savings account which is like for heavy duty savings you know that's just taken out of our paychecks every week uh-huh and then we have a a fourth sort of CD type arrangement um where you know it's in a CD and we can't get to it so i guess our budget is just what's in our checkbook we don't say we have x amount for entertainment x amount for gas it's just we know some weeks we might be able to go out for dinner two times some weeks one time some weeks three times um so there's nothing really that we have written down for a budget uh-huh but i'm a saver i would rather if i had twenty extra dollars i would rather save it than spend it and that's my philosophy and um yeah sometimes i i you know i think that that's not necessarily the best way to live but i i always think that you're going to need it for a rainy day you know how about you right well we're very very similar we i have worked yeah for a goal of saving three months' salary wow and and we put that uh in a account um-hum and we just leave it there that's our emergency account if the car breaks down i mean we can take money out of that but you know then our goal after the next month is to rebuild it up to three months' salary um-hum um-hum right now we've only we've recently done that so now we have extra money we don't have to slap in that account so we're looking into mutual funds or uh just uh common stock you know anything like that that we can get a higher return on our money um-hum uh see we do have the checking account we have Carla works for TI so she has a CODA plan you know where she puts in if they put in a dollar she she puts in a dollar you know TI pays fifty cents oh oh that's great it's sort of like a matching fund then she gets like eight percent interest on top of that so that's been uh um-hum pretty juicy for last couple of years um-hum yeah that's wonderful and one nice thing that my company does um and i know this is going on all over the country but they allow you to put into um a certain fund um-hum whatever you think some of your major medical expenses are going to be for the year such as any prescriptions um if you wear glasses or contacts any expenses you might have for that any dental expenses you anticipate if you have kids day care that sort of thing um outside of a major medical hospitalization problem anything that that might be medically related uh-huh and so you claim that amount at the beginning of the year let's say you determine that's five hundred dollars uh-huh they'll withhold five hundred dollars from your paycheck um broken up into fifty two weeks so whatever that is divided by fifty two yeah and what what in in a sense happens is you end up paying those bills in pretax dollars yeah do you have something like that no well they may have we just haven't taken advantage of it it's really wonderful in our case we don't have that many medical expenses thank God and so i only claim two hundred dollars uh-huh yeah so i my salary in a sense was lowered by two hundred dollars right and they break that up into three dollars and eighty five cents a week that's taken out automatically and then if i go and get my teeth cleaned for thirty dollars i pay the thirty dollars and then i send it in to the it's Blue Choice i send it in to them and then they send me a check back for thirty dollars but the nice thing is that that thirty dollars i wasn't taxed on right initially because it it almost looked like i never made that thirty dollars and it's really wonderful if i this is the first year we did it and uh next year i i'm just going to claim a lot more if you don't spend it all then you do lose it but i feel we could have benefitted from even two hundred dollars more from it huh so but uh it's a nice little savings account and then they they tell you if you'd like you can put the money that you save by not paying taxes into a savings account and they'll do like what you mentioned about matching it and that sort of thing yeah but um so if you don't use it in one year you lose the hum yes if you don't lose it so if you decided to claim or or put aside five hundred dollars and you only spent four fifty they let you know each quarter and they'll let you know you have three hundred dollars left two hundred dollars left but if it gets to be the end of the year and you haven't spent that fifty then you do lose it yeah well it's time to go get your teeth cleaned again yeah right or just buy a new set of glasses or or whatever oh yeah that's that's true too but i i don't know how people can really live on a budget our i mean a budget that's really written out uh-huh um you know this amount of dollars because you your life just fluctuates so much and i mean each week is so different some weeks you're just going to go over that and some weeks you're going to go under and so to me it's just easier to yeah well there again we both have the natural tendency to save and like so if we have the extra money we're going to slap it away as opposed to someone else who goes out and blows it i don't know yeah that's true that's true right that's true yeah a very good point so for those people that are in debt like you said you pay your credit card off at the end of the month and so do we because i hate interest yeah right oh i hate it too so i mean but some people don't care about interest well you you know some people look at their their credit card limit as a loan in a sense and they um yeah you know if their limit is twenty five hundred dollars if they have a hundred left they'll spend that because they think they have it yeah and then will just end up paying interest for the rest of their lives practically right it's a vicious circle yeah it really is yeah credit cards are good if you use them correctly um-hum but they can be very dangerous if you don't oh they sure can that's for sure especially yeah that interest is terrible i know and you know they send these applications out to college kids and college kid gets an application that says y ou've been approved for this amount of credit uh-huh automatic approval and they get them and then these kids start charging and and they get themselves into some deep trouble before they even start making money they're already in debt you know let alone loans and stuff oh yeah no kidding but but yeah that sounds like you uh now what are you doing you've got your big master savings account that you're going to use to retire on or something or well it'll be a long time before that's something we can retire on but um it's yeah it's just uh something that's automatically taken out of our paychecks each week and uh it goes for an emergency we had a disastrous storm here about seven weeks ago and uh-huh Rochester was in a state of emergency for three weeks and everyone lost their power and we had to pay over five hundred dollars to have a tree removed oh man and it wasn't covered by insurance so that's something where you you don't plan on it's not something that you can you know you're not saving for a trip or whatever it's boom here it is and you just have to pay for it so it's an emergency fund but when we got married we you know obviously got some money and that that's what's put in the CD oh and to me i i try and forget that we even have that because i don't want to think about that um yeah but it would be nice to just not always think about saving like have a have a twenty dollar bill and think oh maybe we'll just go out and buy something with this and it'll come yeah yeah we i just did that my wife's birthday was yesterday and yeah so ah really i'm very tight you know with my cash and we haven't really we don't go to malls and shop because they're too expensive and you know we'll buy things here and there but she had we haven't really went shopping for her um-hum oh yeah it'll um-hum oh and you know but she's been really good and she hasn't really said much and i go well look you know today we're going to go out and get something so we went out and blew about a hundred bucks but you know for us that's a that's huge for me you know but you know some people do it every weekend oh isn't it great oh i know you mean um-hum oh it's incredible but we really do i i i like discount stores i have no problem with buying an a no name brand of something yeah um i'm not into labels and that sort of thing yeah our fire our smoke detector's going off making French fries uh oh you're not cooking are you um my husband's making French fries or burning French fries one or the other but um that's funny i feel fortunate that my parents instilled in me you know a sense to save and and you know watch where your money goes uh-huh and i that's very valuable yeah yeah well that's good that's good sounds like uh you know what you're doing yeah i hope so we do you too was your wife always like this or was she did you have to did i have to train her yeah no she she's really good she uh she didn't uh you know she doesn't go out and buy clothes without me knowing it and like Blondie in the cartoons you know she doesn't do anything like that she's not big on sales and all that she's just really she's really great she's really content and just uses what she has and then um-hum i know kind um-hum that's great you know she just you know some day  hello oh hello hi hi uh can you hear me yeah hi my name's Wanette Miller i'm in Berkeley California who am i talking Berkeley California yeah this is Carla in Sherman Texas well hello Carla how are you good how are you doing i'm doing fine so you want to talk football eh yeah that's what they gave us well i guess you better push one yeah okay okay yeah um so tell me do you like football what yeah yeah i love football football professional how could you be from Texas and not like football right right well i'm not really from originally from Texas but uh professional football is my favorite thing to watch really yeah so well then in in that case you're probably a devout Forty Niners fan yeah exactly i do like uh what's his name like what's his name what's who's the quarterback out there Joe Montana oh yeah yeah i do like him yeah yeah well i don't know if you know this but do you know that that both Roger Craig and uh oh what is that linebacker's name oh Ronnie Lotte uh-huh they're not coming back oh really yeah they've signed with another team so they're not going to be as good this year huh well i don't know those are two heavy duty players oh yeah you know Roger Craig and Ronnie Lotte i can't imagine you know so uh yeah it's just amazing you know you i i i i hope that living there in uh in in Texas you you of course don't let anyone know that you like the Forty Niners do you not at all not at all i'm i'm really a a a bandwagon fan i think i like whoever is good that year oh yeah well that's all right too yeah i you know yeah so i so i liked the Forty Niners last year but uh i like watching the Colts play because i'm from originally from Indiana and oh oh wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute if the Colts the Colts the Colts i still have trouble adjusting to that the Indiana Colts yeah the Colts yeah yes i guess i guess that sort of dates me but uh uh i i still think of the Colts as Baltimore yeah yeah i know a lot of people do but uh we like Jeff George so it's fun to watch him play being a rookie and all last year uh-huh oh yeah yeah yeah for sure uh-huh but i imagine speaking of football teams you guys have the what happened to Dallas what what whatever happened to Dallas well they did the wrong thing by uh releasing Landry a few years ago i yeah i thought they were going to lynch those people i know really i i liked Tom Landry you know i have no respect for the for the new coaching staff since they ousted him well you know how do you get rid of an institution like that and and and and justify it i mean oh not i know not at all that really was kind of sad i got sort of a raw deal on that yeah really So uh you you you said something you know uh in in college teams you guys have some some have you got anything promising this year as far as college teams like like uh Texas A and M well or you keech up keep up with collegiate well i have to admit i don't keep up with Texas i keep up with uh i'm from Purdue oh yeah oh absolutely and and so i keep up with what's going on up there they're going to have a new coach this year from Ohio State uh-huh and uh they it looks looks to be promising for Purdue within the next few years so we're looking forward to seeing their program turn around uh yeah well Purdue's been kind of out of it for a long time yeah i i i didn't know Purdue i didn't even know Purdue still had a football oh yeah you don't hear about them much in fact you don't even hear about their basketball team much any more but you know that's how it how it goes i guess yeah well it will be interesting to see well especially you know um uh here here in the in the bay area you know this this used to be the home also of the of the of of the Raiders and yeah a lot of people here still feel that the Raiders are are are are you know in are in Oakland but uh i it's it's going to be real interesting to see what happens because uh there there're a lot of changes are happening here in the bay area as far as that they're talking about maybe getting a new stadium and with those guys leaving i mean uh-huh Feagin and and Ronnie Lotte i i i can't imagine a more devastating blow to a team you know the the uh the the top running back and the top defensive player uh leaving is right gee going to be interesting to see what happens what are they going to do about Bo this year uh Bo well i don't know what they're going to do about Bo Bo is is is pretty much out of it yeah yeah i think Bo is you're talking about speaking about Bo Jackson right well uh uh uh uh it just doesn't sound like that with what's wrong with him that you know we're going to find out what Bo's made out of oh yeah some people think they're predicting that he'll make a big comeback well uh i'm sure he wants to but i would be i'd frankly extremely surprised yeah i would be too i really would that kind of you know that that kind of injury is not not something that well i i hope he does you know more power to him i think that'd be just absolutely wonderful so do you i i guess uh uh i i've talked with a lot of folks from from Texas it yeah uh-huh a lot of folks from Texas uh on this thing and so it's it's it's i guess all you folks just kind of got into this thing huh but right TI uh somehow got us on it yeah well that's great i mean it's kind of fun i've met some great folks i really have and had some great conversations yeah yeah i bet they love to talk about uh pro football don't they oh yeah indeed definitely or any football yeah well i i i i must admit i as growing up football was really a great part of my life i grew up in North Carolina and uh-huh south and and uh played uh football was just you know you played football for North Carolina oh yeah yeah i played football played played in college a little bit but certainly didn't go in the go into pro never never where where'd you go to college i i went to Arizona State oh did you yeah well great what year was that then well it was uh long ago it was it long ago huh uh yes i got out of there undergraduate in seventy three uh-huh should have left in seventy two but i was having too much fun oh yeah those were those were Vietnam War years and you just didn't want to get out too early oh yeah definitely i understand that you hung in there as long as you could anyway well listen Carla it's been a pleasure talking yeah you too and i hope the Forty Niners do well this year thank you and i hope Purdue does too thanks you hang in there okay see you later you okay okay bye-bye  okay all right so uh automobiles huh yeah what uh uh-huh uh right now i have a Nissan Sentra and it's my first car and so i'm really i really have grand designs on on my next car yeah uh-huh yeah yeah huh uh-huh yeah uh is it a how long have you had it uh just the about two years now yeah yeah so about two years now how long will it be before you're ready to buy another one oh probably another year another year or so i'm i'm working in Waco and so i probably won't buy another one until i get another job yeah i see well so but this one i mean i like this one a lot um if i were to get a new car i it may be a Nissan a another uh Nissan yeah yeah that's you uh you like driving that uh that particular brand of foreign car huh yeah yeah we we drive uh American cars right now our our daughter drives a uh something uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh a Toyota but we both drive my wife drives a Cadillac and i drive a Chevrolet right i've always heard that the foreign cars are are the you know foreign cars or the Toyota and Nissan they have good mileage it's better and they last and last my mother has a Toyota and she's she's going on about a hundred and fifty thousand miles yeah right yeah uh-huh on it and it's still trucking so i she's sticking with it yeah yeah um i think i probably want uh a kind of a sportier car the one i have now is gray and i like black yeah uh-huh and probably like tinted windows and a nice stereo system tape player i don't have a tape player in mine which is really killing me yeah oh yeah yeah that that makes a makes it a little different i i i would i thought it would make a difference when i got my car it has a tape player in it but i don't use it a lot uh yeah uh-huh uh-huh but i do listen to the radio all the time i like having that stereo radio with the it's got the equalizer in it right right right the problem with that in Waco is there's not many stations and so you pretty much depend on tapes and CDs etcetera and so on because there's not a whole lot of stations to listen to um yeah right uh-huh yeah yeah do you do a lot of driving or just just what pretty much yeah i not in my own personal car i drive a lot in my uh company car uh-huh um my personal car i usually just drive to work and back or to the mall or something but not a whole lot i do drive back and forth to Dallas a lot in that car yeah yeah well our and that's probably wearing it down quite a bit i guess we could say my wife's car is the family car and we don't you know she drives it to and from work it's about it's you know what the most of its driving is my car is my business car and i drive quite a bit you know in my for my business role uh-huh right uh-huh uh-huh if you were to get another kind of car what would it be well i probably will stick with an American car American made car i i like the size you know the little bit larger car uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh and uh we do tend to travel a bit and it's we just enjoy the you know the ride better for for longer trips right right and uh so i do tend to like riding in American cars i've just never had one so i i can't really compare yeah yeah so yeah i've had i haven't had a a foreign car myself you know for my own personal personal use in a long time i had a little Volkswagen Beetle one time right uh-huh the big problem with a foreign car my father he drove or he always forever and ever he's had Audis and those German cars and they're so expensive to get fixed um-hum yeah right yeah and that that's a big big uh minus sign for the foreign cars yeah yeah i have some uh i have some business acquaintances that drive Jaguars and uh you know i really like the looks of those but uh-huh right uh and i rode in one of them uh not too long ago and it it has a pretty good ride at least riding in the backseat was pretty good you know so uh-huh and uh so it you know its when i when i move up a little bit in uh in price range that you know that's what i've kind of got my eye on is you know is maybe looking at one of those but yes uh-huh yeah i think i've got my eye on a Maxima when my price range is in reach uh-huh yeah yeah so what do you think about the about all the new vans that are out well i i'm not uh really not too interested in a van myself i have seen you know seen them running around town uh-huh yeah uh i'm not too crazy about the looks of them and they look like some of them look like they might be dangerous you're so so you'd be sitting right up on the front with a lot of glass uh-huh right up uh-huh but it it it would seem to me as if i was sitting in a bullet that right of some sort and i'm right in the front you know it's yeah yeah but then you know there's a i think one of them does have a a little more of a front end on it uh-huh but then uh then some of them i like the looks of that better you know to have have a little more vehicle in front of you between you and the oncoming traffic seems to me it'd be a little safer right uh-huh right uh i don't know i think i'll probably be hanging on to my Nissan for a while i guess here yeah so move up as i move up yeah yeah have you how how about uh how do the tires last on that car have you had to put tires on i so i haven't had to put any tires on it and they're they're still they still have tread on them and everything i probably will have to change them here soon but yeah i think that's yeah i think that is one of the things that you find on the foreign cars is that you know that some of the things that might cost you a little more but they last longer you know tires brakes and things like that might right right uh-huh might last a little yeah this car i haven't had any problem at all except for uh a couple of weeks ago the it completely like shut down and it really shouldn't have done this because it's it's relatively new car uh-huh yeah and it completely shut down it wouldn't it just started going it went in drive and just kept driving i would put it in rear it kept going straight so i just drove it to the Nissan place and they said that it looked like i'd bumped something underneath the car huh and i knew i hadn't bumped anything but i had taken it to Sears for an oil change a couple of days before and i'm thinking they did took a screw out or bumped something or something and yeah yeah they might have let it let the the uh lift down with something underneath it exactly that's what i was thinking because i know i haven't done anything to it and so i really haven't had any other problems except for that which i don't think would have been a problem yeah yeah so had i taken it somewhere else or something well it sounds like you you you it sounds like you've got your plans all made though anyway to stick but yeah i haven't had any problems at all stick with that car yes yep well it's been uh been interesting interesting talking to you and uh well okay thanks uh-huh bye-bye oh yeah it's been good talking to you too okay thank you bye-bye
