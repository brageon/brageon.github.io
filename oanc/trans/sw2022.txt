 uh actually it turns out to be an interesting topic because i'm now in the middle of a job search graduating here and realizing that one of the things that's not really well represented in benefits often is flexibility because my wife will have some set of benefits where ever she's working and the ability to mix and match in a useful way particularly with things like medical and dental it's something that i've been uh looking for that's true one of the really disturbing things for me is uh is the way that the government mandates that all insurance policies include particular benefits uh even though you could you might never have any need for them uh here in Georgia they just passed a law for example that every health insurance policy must include coverage for mammograms and pap smears doesn't matter that you're single and male you still have coverage for mammograms and pap smears and uh it's that kind of thing that uh uh that bothers me that's amusing yeah yeah i think we have a similar thing in California and i think that at the moment you can't issue health insurance that doesn't have coverage for substance abuse and certain other mental health issues and uh drug treatment yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're and the result is a lot of people won't provide it at all or over charge even if you're a Mormon you still have to have uh coverage for smoking recovery you know yeah uh but but in general your idea about flexibility i think is a very good one because uh uh if you if you have a a full gamut of of coverages um uh uh there might there might be a lot of things that the company is willing willing to pay for but that you're simply not interested in and what you rather prefer to do is say yeah don't get some of those programs but shuffle the money over to another place to lower your deductibles or something the other things they do seem to be willing to spend money in strange ways for instance i know where my wife works she can get for something like five or ten dollars a month sole health insurance but right it would cost her an additional sixty or seventy a month to include me on that policy well assuming that we both work at places that feel this way we may very well miss out on the convenience of going to the same place because those two places will never get together and agree okay one of them will pay for all of the uh the dental and optical and the other one'll pay for the medical um-hum instead it's it's very much designed towards self only insurance i don't know if all employers are that way but a lot of them i have seen are yeah i think that uh a a lot of them are that way they uh they they deal they deal with coordination of benefits and and no no particular illness who's the primary carrer and who's the secondary carrier but um uh everyone tries to be the secondary carrier and it's very difficult to to get it worked out uh i know at at Hayes uh yeah the coverage for the employee is is completely paid by the company and to get your entire family covered is thirty eight dollars a month well that's pretty good it is i'm very pleased uh i think uh very pleased with the benefit package that we have that has uh uh a dental check ups are completely covered um there's a lot of particular things in the medical package that are covered from the first dollar particularly if you chose low cost alternatives like out patient treatment rather than inpatient and uh things like that um they have good educational benefits if you want to uh try to improve your uh you know go work further on a degree or or get a master's degree of something uh uh course that's something this university at at least the graduate student negotiated plan was very bad about this idea of low cost alternatives um-hum i know in one case there were doctors around who were affiliated with the university who you can go see and all your lab work is covered under their research so in fact you're saving them you know hundreds of dollars in in billings by going to a research uh physician yet at the same time they will only pay based on eighty percent of the customary reasonable charges for the physicians visits and won't take into account the fact that by seeing that doctor you're saving them you know a couple of hundred dollars over going to somebody else and a lot of things like that um-hum um one thing i was wondering is something i've noticed that that they don't publicize much but a lot of companies in particularly organizations school and government organizations have is legal uh services of some sort yeah we don't have that either hm uh in in some ways i think it's it would be very good thing uh you know to be able to get your wills done and yeah and uh advice just by picking up the phone or without having to actually uh you know pay somebody extra  hey Steve um they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think actually this is my first experience with recycling program but um instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about um-hum um i'm starting to split stuff split split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there well here in Saskatoon um much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products uh we're in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people uh there are areas where we could uh actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies type of places where they uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh we're able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are there's a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so we're able to uh take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then but the deposits only on like drink stuff right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing okay okay and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have one one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well oh okay and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so uh it's fairly fairly extensive but again it's uh it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city so is they you're giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you well actually there's there's the opportunity for both oh okay generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to recycle recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then i have a then then they in turn will get some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well that's very cool you know there's a i i heard about a a similar program in New York City where uh i think it's called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think it's mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one location one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and and get more money to these people that desperately need it um yeah um i guess partly because of our climate here in Saskatoon at least the majority of Central Canada uh well i want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to be referred more to Ontario and Quebec yeah but um we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfor welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing um there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although um scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes do they do it with newspapers as well they have done it some um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers they're actually at virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected hm um some of the  so what do you think about caring for older folks Dale well i think um the elderly is a really neat population to care for uh-huh they've got a lot of special needs and at the same time um majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have right very definitely and so you've got a real balance to make there uh-huh what about you well i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old They aren't really that old but they are sort of wearing out My mamma is a dialysis patient um-hum and she is only about sixty four but she's had some pretty close calls and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now and so she's phasing out and but she's also a very very very independent person and doesn't like having having people uh not being able to do things for herself when she wants to uh-huh uh i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home but my daddy keeps talking about it i don't i couldn't possibly couldn't never see him in a nursing home and my grand daddy also doesn't like wouldn't want to be in a nursing home he's ninety i think right on ninety right now oh really and he's living by himself My grand mamma died a couple of years ago oh okay so but he's you know as long as you can have the families take care of the people i'd like to see them stay at home yeah but it gets hard my my grandmother is in her mid eighties uh-huh and she's uh suffering from a low uh well uh progressive Alzheimer's disease uh-huh so she doesn't remember anybody right and uh she remembers things but they are things back whenever she was real young right and so with she was living by herself but my uh uncle has moved in with her to take care of her and it's creating a lot of problems right especially for your uncle i bet oh yes yes now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in Philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with Alzheimer Do they have anything like that in Dallas in Dallas um yeah i've i've heard of several things and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or uh to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up right So they are pretty limited right oh another interesting thing another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives oh really to make sure that they would take care of their responsibilities um-hum i don't think that was mainly with Alzheimer's patients but just patients people in general who were not as independent as they use to be um-hum um-hum well it's it's it's a really day care programs are really neat you know and if the people if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that that is one of the best things to do but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them uh-huh right and i think that's in a way somewhere some an area where some of the day care uh programs have left off because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those uh-huh right to uh get there and to participate in the activities right cause i know there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas uh and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work right and sports right but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly that's true You can't play those things yeah you can't do it but you can sing songs and uh well that's true tell stories about the old times i guess you know you were talking about you're was it your grand mother uh-huh that was having Alzheimer uh-huh uh being able to tell old stories You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way and they love to recollect i mean they just you know and they will just go on and on with these stories and they have such a memory do they like to listen to other people recollect though my grandmother doesn't she she wants to tell to tell you about her story over again so right which is fine you know so well that is good because we  um the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a uh long term financial plan and a monthly budget the only thing i do now is uh put the data into Quicken i don't know if you're familiar with that yeah i've uh have some friends of mine who use Quicken and uh i considered using it once myself but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date so i i kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken at least for now um-hum hm i i've found that it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife or i'll write a few checks and then we'll uh uh not bother to total it um-hum and then it it comes comes in just to do all the arithmetic so it helps with that yeah well i have similar problems but uh we just have the one check book and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we'll get behind like you say but uh it doesn't really seem to be too too tight if we remember just remember to keep everything up up to date and balanced um well how do you handle the the long range or medium range planning on finances uh actually we haven't had to yet yet uh uh until just recently i guess we've got a a daughter who's eighteen months and another one on the way so um-hum we need to start doing more of that just for uh you know saving for college and things like that we tried a way try to put away between two and four thousand a year just for that for yeah well that's pretty good if you can do that i know um i have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but um we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away for college so um-hum we're gonna be starting a regular payroll deduction in the fall and then the money that i'll be making this summer we'll be hm putting away for her college fund hm sounds good yeah i guess we're we're just at the point my uh my wife worked until we had a family and then you know now we're just going on the one income so it's a lot more interesting trying to um-hum find some extra i think payroll deductions probably the only way we'll be able to um do it just you know kind of enforce the savings um-hum but uh it'll be interesting to see well our situation is just a little bit kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently uh took on a full time job well almost full time hm so it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for uh long range goals like college and um significant travel and that kind of thing that sounds good but uh uh i was just curious what uh part of the country oh ah Wisconsin okay how about you um Cincinnati actually i was kind of wondering if they'd be collecting people with uh the western accents or something like that i don't know how many people are uh going to be involved in this but um-hum uh well that's interesting i'm uh uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading Telecom Digest or was there another uh a colleague of mine at uh at work got some information over um the computer network called internet oh okay yeah that's how i got it as well but uh and he just forwarded that on to me and um it sounded like it'd be an interesting project to participate in so i um-hum sent yeah it'll be interesting to see what they sent back some E-mail it'd be interesting to see how the data base well i guess we're talking about the experiment and um-hum probably try to get back on the topic but uh it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to uh dollar figures i guess um-hum you know we could talk about some of the long range goals what other long range goals do you have besides college yeah um well i think either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point um-hum uh i guess we'll have to factor that in if we're if we're not working for employers that happen to fund that it seems like every year my employer scales back you know a little bit of their tuition reimbursement um-hum i mean they use to reimburse it a hundred percent and now it's uh now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class and uh it's it's a real shift from what we had before uh because we're  anyway uh how about you what do you do with your budget what do i do um at the moment it's utter chaos um right now i'm just uh i i don't really have a budget per se i'm i uh it's called living within your means uh-huh you know which means at the moment um paying off the Visa bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse yeah that's true um but uh no i don't really have a budget at the moment um but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i don't usually don't exceed that unless i unless the Visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that that then it goes through the moon so yeah that sort of a problem yeah so um what'd you we're trying we're trying to um so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is so not much on that side of it to add to it we're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but so you can afford to get a house yeah we'd like to do that some day we have this dream yes but we don't know how long it will be a dream we we're kind of real we're really happy that we don't have any debt but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this um economy right now so we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month yeah so what do you and your husband do we're missionaries actually yeah uh-huh are you really and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota hm and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here no kidding and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home i see so overseas where would you be going so Africa Nigeria really yeah really how long would you be there about four years we're career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year with with what church um we're with Wycliffe Bible Translators oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as i recall so yeah they could very well and there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was so um are you uh are you uh active in translation um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh um-hum came home and got married and we will go back back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators well i always wanted to do translation but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak it's easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could you're free to travel anywhere you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but there's i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did um-hum you know complete a survey in one area i'd switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten and how to do market stuff but in about um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but it's uh Senegalese French so uh i'm terrified to speak it in um in France in France yeah because they're real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didn't know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said i'm not going to tell you what you said so since then i have refrained from speaking any French except in Senegal um i don't know what i said to him but uh i didn't ask him either must have been terrible the um was it Henry Macon said that the the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die and i it it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that free style English is just takes on new  okay well lets see i i guess i'll i'll mention it i always one of the things i always considered was real important about job benefits i always uh i know they can't do anything about it but i always thought location and quality of life in the region was important towards a a job benefit at least it had a lot to do with what i chose is in in my job and and and besides uh you know uh i guess uh uh salary and uh the work but see those are the things that they can't really do much about that's true unless it's a large corporation that has a lot of different branches uh it was important for me to pick a job uh to choose a job that was in the northeast uh because i like the region and my family is here at one point i'd interviewed for a company that wanted to send me to Boise Idaho and that really seemed like a negative benefit to me um-hum yeah the uh i was uh i actually was from the midwest but i uh i always liked the uh concept of going to a warmer client climate uh so um-hum uh i generally leaned towards the sun belt uh i've worked in uh San Diego and i've worked in Atlanta so you can see that i've moved moved father south since then uh i used to live in Ohio when i when i was going to school and uh it's still it it becomes a very strong benefit i uh i interviewed with uh companies in uh Baltimore and uh Boston and uh just the the amount of time that it shuts down that that winter shuts you down for activity always used to bother me because i really never got into the winter sports but i like to be very much into the active intramural sports that was important to me um-hum uh other job benefited uh job job benefits uh uh i like the idea of uh companies being flexible uh uh with uh time schedules as much as possible i mean i you can't do too much and i understand that i agree with that uh i found though that that uh it it will benefit both the employee and the company i work for a firm that does have a very flexible schedule and i can't remember the last time that i just worked forty hours a week so the uh it it works out that if i have to go in late for a reason or i have to leave early for a reason no one raises an eyebrow but because of that i'm not a clock watcher if i if i knew they were expecting me there at eight thirty every day and i couldn't leave until five i i think i'd be uh uh have a greater tendency to wait until the clock hit five and then say i'm out of here you're out of there yeah you then you then you punch in a clock and all you are is an hourly as needed person and then you say well you know why should i give them anymore right but what they uh if they respect you as a professional you treat them like a professional at that i i i take it then that you are also a professional a salaried employee yeah that's correct that's correct uh it usually they end up getting a lot more hours than i i i uh than the classic forty hours a week sometimes i hate to think about it if i would actually add up hours and i figure if i were getting time and a half what i was really making per hour right oops but uh well let's see what other i i've always liked i've always liked some vacation i i've i've been fortunate i actually had a another um-hum uh the company i just just transferred jobs about a week ago so but uh for the last five years i was in a company that had four weeks vacation wow now that was a real nice benefit it gave me a lot of flexibility uh but of course now i've gone to zero amount of years in the company so now i'm back to the um-hum to the uh original two weeks that was a tough benefit to give up right uh the company i'm working for now starts everyone out at three weeks vacation yeah that is a good benefit and i i thought that was great except during the first year i ended up only being able to take about a week and a half of it right because of the amount of amount of work that you had to be done right i was i was so busy uh and it we've got a very small department and i was just uh wearing so many hats that it was very difficult for me to take time off and when i did take the time off i'd uh get calls from work anyway so it's only been uh in the  so it says how do you keep up on news um i suppose i had longer to think about it so i'll just uh answer the question i right okay i get almost all well the majority of my news from radio and news letters which is kind of unusual but it's a pretty cost effective or time effective way to do it because on TV you have to to put up with all the happy talk and the commercials yeah and um then on uh like newspapers well they just take too long to read i use to read news papers very faithfully but i just ran out of time so i tape record National All Things Considered from National Public Radio right and i i when i ride the bike my ride my bike to campus i i have it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right uh-huh oh okay and how about you uh that's interesting i've i've never heard of the news letters angle i'm also an All Things Considered person Weekend Edition whatever um-hum um-hum uh i generally enjoy it although sometimes they have a tendency to do twenty minute features on things i'd just had soon not hear for about two minutes hm all the all the AIDS cases in Miami for example yeah yeah exactly yeah that's right well i mean the the only thing about them is that they the the their news uh most of the time slanted tends to be pretty slanted to the left and you just can't tell really what's happening for i mean take for example the economy where they've not not not them alone but most of the news media but probably they more more uh strongly than a lot of the others have all these programs about bad economic news and as soon as the news gets good it just disappears you know just just don't report it to the same extent that they do about the bad news yeah although i think that's probably uh true of most news coverage in general good news isn't news right hm i don't know but i think that for example after the uh after the uh Iran Iraq War when uh oil oil prices came way down i think it would have been news that oil company profits decreased as i'm sure they did you just didn't hear about it right so um i i get pretty upset with them actually a lot but the only thing is there's no other game in town except for monitor which is you you know about um about the Christian Science monitor program uh yeah on television or radio uh no no on on radio they have an hour a day news program but that's yep oh excuse me i was just going to say up here they they broadcast that i think between five AM and six AM which is a a little before i get up so i usually miss it i'm sorry right yeah that it i i don't think they well i mean i know they don't broadcast it here at all and the only way that i can ever listen to that is when i'm in another part of the country so right uh you know i mean they're they're really the only game in town and if you want to get different news for an hour or a little bit more than an hour that's that's about the only way to do it which i find kind of unfortunate now there is the McNeil Lehrer Lehrer news hour but that's on TV and then you've got to be sitting there yeah like like you i often i rarely spend time watching news on TV the uh i gave up on network news years ago and it just doesn't usually work out i have time to watch something more in depth like McNeil Lehrer so yeah for me it's pretty much a diet of uh All Things Considered and i like to look at the Wall Street Journal at work which uh i think does a fine job it too has a slant but uh um-hum yeah well at least it's not the same slant is is All Things Considered huh yeah exactly and so that's that's true yeah but now i like the Wall Street Journal if i subscribed well let's see if i subscribed to a newspaper i probably would get it it's it'd be that or USA Today but um they they have good in depth articles mostly on things that have to do with you know credit cards or other things relating to to financial things or or financial planning but they also have some good in depth articles beginning on page one yeah i think uh what is it the fourth column of page one is uh kind of famous in it's own right just for human interest stories or business interest stories i mean um-hum right i was discussing actually one of those stories with i just happen to i don't know how i acquired a Wall Street Journal it just happened uh last month there was a story on recycling uh i think actually that was a column one story though um-hum but uh that talked about the way that uh some communities are trying to recycle so much that they don't have anybody to buy the stuff from them to reprocess and in one locality i think it was Portland ended up burning the stuff some of it some of it because there's nothing else they could do with it right back to square one yeah so it was it was you know good to find out a little bit more than than you would in certainly in any story on network news i mean not just that was the only thing but it was it was good uh discussion of the markets for various recycled products yeah and that's that's the kind of thing the Journal does best i find i don't have time to read through the whole thing certainly but i find if you just  so well what what are you guys doing with recycling uh well i mean in DC there's a law uh that was recently passed that like um you have to it's a law i think that organizations have to provide recycling i guess recycling bins they have to recycle it's a law to do it yeah they just they just did the same thing up here uh the whole county built a uh uh incinerator actually only two thirds of the county built it right and they also of course they had to the New York State EEC the environmental people mandate that you have to recycle things so anybody who wants funding or doesn't want their landfills closed and sued has to uh recycle it's like um i mean personally i've never been a recycling nut in terms of like i don't i don't go out of my way and i think like they put uh receptacles around campus and the dorms and that makes me um more apt to do it because it's there it's more convenient right yeah a lot of people up here the exact same way you know they won't lift a finger and uh it hasn't gotten around here that you know you go to any store or something and there is a trash can there isn't a bin for glass a bin for right it's it's really just on the verge it it hasn't quite happened yet but that you know i was on vacation a couple places uh uh Utah had some bins yeah i mean i'm looking right here there's a waste bin for waste i don't know i guess they recycle i guess they can recycle normal waste i'm not really sure and there's trash cans too i mean generally when i'm right when i if i go by the waste bin i'll put something in there if it fits they've got cans and bottles um and bins for paper so you wouldn't walk around for a long time with a can in your hand because you couldn't found a uh a bin for it no no not really i mean toss it in the first place that it that you could find yeah i mean like the right now i'm in uh our student center studying and i'll go out of my i'll walk up get up from my table and walk out of my way i mean well they're right near the trash can so i'll i'll toss it in the bin but um as far as if i'm walking in the street drinking a soda and i finish it i'm going to toss it in the nearest trash can probably i mean it's convenient it's it's there if the the recycling bin is not there i'm probably i'm if it was there i'd use it right well i think well maybe that's a good way to uh promote recycling is just to make it more available yeah yeah exactly i mean even in my in my dorm it's in the basement but i pile it i let i let them pile up in the trash in my uh in the garbage in um a giant bag a a shopping bag and then uh take it down in the basement and toss it in the uh recycling trash can um but yeah i mean more receptacles uh around on the streets even would would um make people do it i mean if it's there they're going to do it still i mean some people won't even go that far out of their way there are people who are pretty ignorant and i mean or are really set in their ways yeah i guess you know my mom she always recycled everything yeah so i'm use to it but if i was use to just throwing things away it would be a really tough habit to unlearn yeah so maybe you know the next generation will be a little bit more uh conscientious than we are yeah i'm sure they will i mean with uh the way things are going i mean uh it's going towards a more green type of thing green thinking should call it people more aware more aware they need to save the environment and all that course you are on a college campus where people are more aware than the general public right oh definitely i mean there's been plenty of uh up roar about the uh Marriott using um styrofoam cups and styrofoam plates and that kind of thing now now that's really tough because you read stuff and you can't tell whether a styrofoam plate is actually more or less wasteful than a paper one or some other plastic yeah cause i mean yeah the paper ones are have plastic coated and they're probably even worse i don't really know yeah who knows what's not harder to recycle and uh you know if you put them in a landfill they take up the same amount of space yeah because the paper doesn't break down either well i think it's possible to recycle styrofoam but it's more expensive um they do have reusable cups that people can uh i mean basically you've got carry around this cup if you want to if you want to be uh environmentally um conscious and they i believe they give discounts on on drinks if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive you have a discount on your on your on your drink instead of the regular price or whatever well that that's good i mean God forbid you should actually you know have a cup and then wash it out once and a while and reuse it yeah right yeah like imagine that  okay okay um so what do you think um about putting an elderly in a nursing home well i think that it it varies on on the individual basis hm uh sometimes it is there's no alternative uh you do not have uh um-hum uh family available or family that's uh you may not even have family that is uh in and who around that's true yeah so sometimes it's not an alternative and i think uh but i think also sometimes it can be uh a benefit if it's for a short time sometimes in a nursing home hm um-hum um especially after if it's after an acute illness to get over a uh or to rehab after uh an illness that's true i never thought of that yeah sometimes you know it sometimes the nursing homes are good for uh just short periods of time that's true until they get over that hump of whatever it is they're dealing with um-hum because too often the acute hospitals will are sending them out much faster than what they're really able to yes they really are they don't like to keep them longer than a week but so so there is some good to it uh sometimes too it's used as a dumb job you know the families well the families do not necessarily yeah what do you mean uh know what to do with them and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home yeah that's true so you see uh there's both sides to it too what do you think yeah and it depends on how how sick the person is too and what you're capable of like if you have a family to take care of you know of your own yeah yeah um i would personally like it if my parents were to get ill i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help that's not always possible that's true but um to the best of my ability i'd like to do it until it gets impossible well i think that's also where you're gonna to have a lot of people who are going to it's there's not a choice it's because there it's not economically feasible even to put them in a nursing home right um-hum yeah so that that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the uh either Medicare or insurance to cover it that's true yeah so but i think nursing homes can be good just depends on what kind they are you know an you need to check them out ahead of time yeah and then there's also some that are set up for specialties uh um-hum i know some elderly unfortunately some elderly have to go to or have i guess it's Alzheimer's or where they wander or or um um-hum confused or have some mental problems yeah that they're and you need a special nursing home for that you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around and you need people who are trained for that type of problem yeah right and know what they're doing with that yeah so so there's different types of nursing homes i think yeah well my uh grandmother's not really in a nursing home but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it and she really liked the idea of of moving there she's not ill yet um-hum but um she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided that um she's eighty five years old that eventually you know she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden she's very independent so she's in this nursing home it's out in the country and um she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook gives her a little bit of her own independence but she still has uh a security there uh-huh right some support and then there's also a sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then so if she ever does become ill um it'll be like family around her that's right and i i've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of uh activities going on for the ones who are more active yeah um-hum yeah she so it's not sort of like uh uh a sick place um-hum no she loves it she had a great social life and she travels and um it's in in Missouri in the in the mountains and it's beautiful and uh i i hope that i have something like that when i get older yeah i think i think of the um i think the the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the the uh elderly uh person who's going in um-hum and the family that's going to be uh effected effected by it oh definitely it's and uh you know sometimes it can those choices those choices can be made in advance and sometimes the choices uh because of the nature of the illness when they're um-hum right  uh guy uh some of my things i i'd like to have a short work week oh okay you know and and we need you know better health insurance and you know cause okay we can start off there let's just get started i don't wanna well you know uh talk about it now and then be bored when we get to it yeah okay okay so i just press one then right okay ready right yep okay so so you think uh i i think a short work week is real nice uh i have a thirty seven hour work week how about you well right now i'm i'm just a student i only work part time but i i've work in the job force before and uh-huh forty hours is just too long you just don't have any time to do anything it it seems like Saturday Saturday you you get off but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday and if we could have us if we could have a thirty two hour work week well that'd happen is that for every four people we'd give another job uh-huh right and then that way that everybody would have a three day holiday okay and that way that more that that would make a a bigger market we'd have uh more recreation people would have time to do it there'd be less of a stress level we'd have less we'd have less crime we'd have to we'd have to build less prisons we'd need you know less police force yeah it all makes sense to me although there may be more crime i mean if people have more leisure time it's not clear in that it it that's that's that's a that's a possibility one of one of the problems they're facing now a lot of people now is that the health insurance yeah is that the small businesses can't afford can't offer us health insurance uh-huh and it it it's too costly and then what is what is happening is that they're on um a policy where they have so X amount of of users in it okay and so they get a specific rate well what happens is that if if people start becoming having chronic illness and and and things like that what happens and they where they have to spend out a lot of money for one particular it's called a a group well what'll what happens then is that right they cancel because they just can't cancel the indivigal so that they have to cancel is just like life insurance they have to cancel everything um-hum so what they do is is that they they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage right so but i'm i'm you know i'm i'm satisfied with my job i'm i'm an engineering student and i work for my instructor and i'm right i'm not a typical student i'm i'm older i'm i'm in my thirties okay and so i have a lot of job experience and yeah my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose but in the in the same token right it's a really really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have you know nobody breathing down my back and one of the things that i i really hate about jobs i don't i don't like bosses that that you know wanna yell at you and you know and are are down your back and all this and that i i just really can't deal with that so yeah uh what kind of what kind of jobs have you done well i do work uh research in computer science and i've just been doing that for a few years now so uh-huh uh i my job has most of the benefits i want um what i really like is i like being like they send me to conferences for instance but probably not as much as i'd like but uh you know that's just nice being you know having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of uh they also a really important thing to me is when they uh they pay for continuing education like i i get night courses that they're they'll cover right now and that's really good yeah that's great you have what you might call knowledge power you know when when you work at a company yeah right whether you know it or not is that you're categorized some people can be let go and replaced like uh say uh a a typist uh somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone a receptionist but if you're a person that's doing computer type things and you have the you have the knowledge you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system well then you're you're vital to the company and you get more of the benefits so yeah that's where i'm that i'm i like i'm into computers too and that's one of the things that i've found in in any one one of these jobs and anything i've done is that to have knowledge when you have the knowledge you're you're not gonna um you know be let go you know be one of the last ones to let go anyway right but what i  okay so uh what are your camping experiences like lately they haven't been much but as a child i used to go camping a lot with my my parents we would uh we lived in Mississippi then and we'd go out and camp for the weekend and fish and uh-huh but we camped like in tents not in uh the mobile home or the oh yeah you roughed it right that's what i consider really camping basically yeah i the only really camping experiences uh i've had i guess was probably with the Cub Scouts or the Boy Scouts when uh i was younger uh we used i remember one time we went to uh uh-huh uh there's a lake called Lake Lanier here in Georgia that we went to and we camped out on the island and we kind of got familiar with that lake yeah we setup we set up all our you know we we canoed out to some island and uh that was a lot of fun set up because we were all we were isolated from everyone else but um uh-huh that's pretty much i haven't been lately i have i've i've wanted to lately but there's a i'd like to i need to get some equipment first and i don't really have the money for it now i've i've been looking into like buying uh uh a tent of some sort but they're really expensive like the good ones they are uh-huh so that's kind of put a cramp in my camping style so late lately i've just kind of for outdoorsy type stuff i've pretty much been you know one day trips where i'll i'll maybe drive up to Alabama somewhere like in a northern Alabama i'm into rock climbing a little bit so so if one of my roommates has some ropes ropes and stuff and sometimes we go up there and oh that's neat climb around on the rocks and stuff but usually it's a one day affair it's not a overnighter type thing but i'd like to i'd like to really get into that kind of thing yeah well lately about my only halfway experience with camping is we uh my husband races cars uh-huh and in fact we come to Atlanta for about ten days every year and and that's part of my camping experience is we camp out there a little bit sleep in our van or what have you for a few nights and um oh yeah yeah kind of cook out of it and what have you but the last the last true camping experience i had is when uh i drove across country with a friend of mine he lives he goes to school out in California and we drove his car out there and uh we drove you know we took kind of a scenic route we went through uh uh the Grand Canyon and oh sounds nice and uh someone one of us had a tent but not all of us had sleeping bags and it was kind of a it was late summer but it get it got it got really cold at night a lot colder than we thought it would so the sleeping bag was just big enough to um-hum was just small enough so that it didn't actually cover everyone so it was kind of uh a wrestling match for the for uh you know warmth so we we we we roughed it until about four in the morning and we were all just freezing so we got up and got in the car and uh drove on we were on a kind of a schedule tight schedule anyway so we couldn't stay too long but we drove on that morning to uh Las Vegas so i think that was probably my last uh true camping experience yeah well well whenever i mention camping anymore to my husband he says i'm too old for this he says i i like my luxuries anymore but i think i'd still like to you know do a little camping that like i say i it brings back memories of my real young years and uh yeah he said he'd lived on a farm too long and that was too much like camping anyway true camping well this time of year it's gets really beautiful down the springtime in Georgia with all the dogwoods and i bet there's all kinds of it's real north there's really some real beautiful spots to to hike and stuff in north Georgia you know up in the kind of getting up the mountainous you know the the uh-huh well i know when the leaves change there too would be a pretty time except you can't really depend on your weather yeah it sure is that's true like today it's it's pouring it it takes the leaves around here i mean it's beautiful when they uh when they change it it seems like it happens so fast that if you don't get there at the right time you're gonna miss everything um-hum and the first year we came up there the leaves were changing and since then we've been coming about a week or so too early but uh i would think that that would be a really nice place for camping yeah they're getting they're getting started early this year i'll tell you that much the so the dogwoods are already starting to bloom have they oh well that is really nice well i'm sure there are a lot of camping places around here but we get so wrapped up in everyday life we don't get take time to go out and enjoy them um in the spring when the bluebonnets are pretty here i think that's our biggest deal there's just fields of bluebonnets and um-hum that'd be nice what we call Indian paint brushes it's it's really nice i haven't been through that part of the country so i don't really know what i don't really know what it's like over there mostly nothing  live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state and uh it's just coincidental that that's the way it is but my feelings happen to be that i'm against capital punishment uh and i feel that it's barbaric actually it seems out of date with civilization as really even if the the crime is extremely extremely serious i think so because i think what we're talking about is is uh life making and life taking decisions and i i don't think any one human being has the right to take away the life of any other human being not that it's a a religious feeling or anything like that but it seems hypocritical to me that we'd say in the case of murder for instance that uh because you took away somebody else's life and because that is so very wrong we are going to take away your life i don't see that that makes any sense really well it's not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals so if some person just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people does he really have the right to continue living and be a burden on society i don't think it's a matter of the of the murderer's rights i think it's a matter of our uh penal people's rights and i don't think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment uh to deter other people from doing such heinous crimes uh for instance i think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody who commits any murder of any sort and i also think that uh other things that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as putting prisoners to work and making them earn their their pay yeah i agree with that part yeah definitely but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if they're uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesn't matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldn't change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i don't see it as much of a deterrent either well some criminals would see it as a life in jail doesn't particularly sound too harsh to someone who's been living on the street you know for all his life and then uh jail jail time would seem like uh you know a break or a a paid paid sustenance for the rest of his life yeah and i think that's unfortunate that is probably the way it is today and i think that ought to be changed uh i think like i said i think people ought to be made to pay for their stay and not make it pleasant for them i think hard labor should be required even among people that are are are not able yeah make it make it harsh as possible to perform hard labor you know if they if they died naturally from working then i guess that would be okay because that wouldn't be uh putting anybody to death forcibly yeah but uh i i can't see i can't see executing people it just seems so barbarous barbaric in these times uh well i live in California i'm not really up on it i i think we don't have capital punishment either huh-uh in California i i thought there was but i could be wrong yeah what amazes me is how many people speak out in favor of capital punishment even here in New York people really want to see it uh be put into effect it seems more so than those of us who feel the way i feel uh uh at least are vocal well saying that no they want things to stay the way they are lot of people want to see capital punishment made legal yeah i'm one of those guys okay um i guess uh i guess we did what we have to do and i don't see any instructions as far as doing anything else so i uh it's nice talking with you okay you too you too bye bye okay take care bye  right now i'm at um University of Pennsylvania i'm a graduate student oh and the benefits that i get are very minimal yeah but i do get my health insurance paid for but i don't have any kind of disability insurance or um yeah let's see no disability insurance no vacation well i get in a way i get vacation pay because i get to set totally set my own schedule uh-huh but not any real significant benefits my health insurance is very minimal right um i'm i'm a co-op student at GTRI uh-huh uh i go to school at Georgia Tech and we don't have benefits to speak of we don't have health insurance or paid vacation and you're undergraduate student or graduate student um-hum undergrad undergrad yeah um-hum yeah here they for the grad students at least in physiology department which my degree degree granting department is biological engineering but physiology and the biomedical departments at least pay the health insurance engineering doesn't even do that oh yeah yeah but i don't know i think that it would be great if instead of having health insurance and all those things tied to a job the way they are now uh-huh uh-huh so that some people can get them and some people can't and it's like having two classes of income some that is taxed and some that is not it'd be great if they had right everybody responsible for their own health insurance uh-huh and either that or what they could be responsible for their own health insurance but if they did take the company benefit then that would be taxed like other income um-hum so then that would everybody would know what their real income was and that their benefit that they were getting from the company was costing them something and that they might want to look around to get something better somewhere else uh-huh well that's a good idea i had never thought about it that way so i guess i would like to see something like that and then i guess the going beyond just the idea of benefits having instead of um a national health insurance system having a sort of like an FDIC for health insurers so if if you're health insurance company goes out of business you don't lose everything if you get sick um-hum yeah right right that's that would be a wonderful idea but on the other hand in in the current state of the current system i'll uh-huh whenever i get out of here i'll look for a job probably an academic job that would um you know benefits i don't know how important that'll be usually academic jobs you get TIAA for your retirement plan right uh-huh which is a it's a mutual fund that allows you to transfer your benefits with you with whatever job you go to um-hum and i didn't know that a lot of an academic jobs give you that but on the other hand state retirement if you work for a state university can be very secure in taking good care of you really i know my daddy worked for the federal government uh-huh and he was in the soil conservation service and then after he retired from that he went taught school for a while and he had taught school early in his career so he got the um-hum um-hum federal retiree benefits and the state retiree benefits and the most important for him has been the health insurance because my mama isn't particularly well wow um-hum um-hum she has um she's a kidney patient on dialysis and he was saying that um-hum now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs Lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture um-hum and her drug bill is now down to two hundred dollars a month wow so and that's the lowest it's been in quite some time and so health insurance can be a real big important thing to get yipes um-hum right what kind of job are you thinking about getting when you get out oh i'm i'm just not entirely sure i have only been working here for one quarter this is my first quarter here and uh i'm not really all too sure what kind of jobs are available and uh i haven't gotten them yet i'm going in a few um um-hum and i i i'm going to be doing research for a professor next quarter and see how i like that see uh uh-huh if research for a school would be something i would consider hum what kind of company are you working with co-oping oh oh it's the Georgia Tech Research Institute it's affiliated with the university um i see and uh we do research uh the one i'm in the lab i'm in does research in microwaves and antennas and uh we do a lot of research for the federal government uh-huh so a lot of our uh expenses are you know covered by the federal government so right  um so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time generally i don't think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they they're entrenched they don't ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean uh-huh uh-huh i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too um-hum i know some senators and i don't know which ones but they've been in office since the the nineteen forties and um-hum i they they've never had a job i mean they've never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they don't you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year um yeah um-hum which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know i'm going like i i don't understand how they're supposed to be my servants and yet they're paid more than i am and they work less uh-huh you know less than i do uh-huh uh the the only problem the only problem i see with term limitations um is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that there's a very large you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you can't just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person uh i think i think there really is a there's a lot they need to learn you know when you get there i think i think that's true however i think that's always been true uh-huh i mean that's true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover every eight years or four years yeah but and uh they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short uh um-hum i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you don't you we aren't having a massive ballot every four years um-hum yeah uh the other the other thing that that uh bothers me about our system is just that um in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there so it's you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well we're going to just we're i'm i'm just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesn't work you know it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time uh-huh i think i think that that's true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the C i A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for uh-huh a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isn't in West Virginia i hate to tell the senator the senator from West Virginia this information but uh-huh it really doesn't uh the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and uh-huh uh-huh the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but that's a two hour drive uh and uh you know it it's a i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I i don't remember but i think there's yeah uh-huh well i mean i don't see why it makes a big difference the CIA because you know officially they don't do they don't have any operations within the United States other than administrative yeah that's officially uh-huh i mean we all know that that's not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turnover or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain uh-huh but i think that uh all with all the perks that we've given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they aren't paying their their restaurant bills and they're bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks uh um-hum  so how you like New Jersey uh it's pretty good you know you get uh closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants right i guess uh i don't know what part of New Jersey you're in but i guess it's uh fairly industrial yeah it's when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial right uh-huh but i'm i'm about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you don't notice that that other part of New Jersey exists actually very yeah yeah right yeah you you go even a few wide miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air right but uh well i don't know about you but i've always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean there's a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that oh definitely definitely it's uh you know there are a large number of them on the road they're all yeah yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair that's yeah that's that's a big issue is you know a lot of states don't have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that oh even even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year yeah and it's like you get the car that's in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that sure right i guess from what i hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in California yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets yeah so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline right i hope i i'm hoping that comes along quick uh i was reading a an article in Time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going and i guess it's it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know that's not due to uh it's not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the CFC's but it it is coming from cars though uh yeah i think that's a that's a contributor definitely i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluorocarbons chlorofar chlorofluorocarbons right right yeah i guess right now what they're what they're primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating CFC production but well it it it go ahead no it's the type of thing there that uh you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial um-hum so they're on the different part of the cycle of the US the US used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today right and that's one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if if that makes any sense uh in terms of or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh i don't know that's that's kind of an interesting situation there uh what they don't realize those third world countries what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles and it's it's increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places yeah so it's kind of an interesting situation it's not not a real good one actually but no well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction yeah which is the main source of what's clearing out the atmosphere and uh-huh replacing some of the pollutants yeah yeah you don't get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between Atlanta Washington DC area okay so you've got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think well not not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the with the inversion and Los Angeles and all rest of California which is just terrible it sounds yeah Denver's definitely yeah that's one of the worst sure yeah Denver's that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does i guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the world for that uh-huh yeah but i've been pretty lucky i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem although uh i'm really kind of based in Orlando Florida and there you can tell that it's getting worse i mean it it definitely it's not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can yeah there it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it exactly yeah and there's not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but it's kind of it's um-hum  it sounds like you feel like taxes are probably too high well i think there's a big waste of our tax dollar it does seem that way i was trying to think of whether we pay more tax now than we did ten or twenty years ago but it doesn't seem like we get as much out value for the tax dollar we don't uh we it there's there's too much um uh pocket stuffing uh going on as far as different companies contracting to do things for the county and do uh projects for the state and you know course they they prove that all the time on over the TV uh-huh you know yeah it does seem like the special interest groups are what what keeps taxes high but i right that uh i just i just pay you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property uh-huh i just i mean when i tell you little piece of property i mean i've got five and a half acres it's out in the country and if i could get what they're charging me for taxes on that i would sell it in a minute oh boy you know so that that's why i just don't uh there's a lot of you know a lot of expense as far as our taxes and all the all the hidden costs that they spend our money on that that they shouldn't be spending our money on but uh i i'm i'm very uh i'm a single parent so i'm very touchy about taking every damn dime i make yeah that does make it difficult it does really does are you you are you accountant an accountant or uh well i used to work in finance but i i don't any longer uh-huh i was also trying to think of whether our tax rates are high compared to other countries i seem to recall that uh many many other countries have higher tax rates than ours but they may also get better value for the dollar that's the real question right well you know i've i can handle the i can handle the tax money the amount of taxes that i pay i can handle that uh-huh but it you know when you hit all the uh bad roads and uh and you hear of all the misuse of the money and that right that's a that's a bigger right that's what's irritating problem to me than than having to pay them It's also irritating that you we keep hearing a lot of lip service about how how to make it better and how to spend it more wisely but they never to seem hear that that it changes or improves right well i think i think one of our uh and this is really not the total uh thing uh not totally on taxes but one of our things is our on our uh the our Federal Government is our uh why in the world they don't get rid of one of the houses either get rid of the senate or get rid of the Congress you know get rid of one of those housing systems and uh because that's costing that's costing the taxpayer multimillions multimillions uh-huh and uh but they govern each other and they they vote their selves in to staying in where they are you know and um i don't i've never understood uh you know why i there is one state what state is in the United States that only has one housing i meant one governing body um i don't remember hearing that okay there is there's one state i've i in fact i don't know whether it's New Hampshire it's a northern state um or New England state that has one housing body and uh one governing body and um uh-huh you know they their taxes are are more well spent but uh no i've you know i disagree with a lot of things but um a lot of things i can't change but uh what state what part of the country are you from i'm from Texas but now i live in California okay i'm course i'm i'm from Texas too but i i'm think my the two counties that i pay taxes in are two of the highest tax rate counties there are anywhere around here which counties are that where where do you live so i live in uh my i have some my little piece of land is in uh Benedict County and i live in Smith County and what state is that in Texas still in Texas still in Texas you hear this Texas accent yeah i can't get rid of it course in Texas at least you still don't have income tax well i think we pay it in other ways i think we i really think we pay it in a lot of other ways it's funny to me too that uh why the government taxes has a tighter higher tax rate for a single person than they do for a married couple  hi this is drug testing for government employees only or was it for everybody this is for everybody for for private and commercial sector uh my feelings are is that i i don't really think that they should test for drugs that you if you gonna take a job you know and then they say well we're we're gonna we're gonna test you you know periodically or something like this because the job is of the security nature or for the you know and the public safety or something that's might be one thing but i really believe that the employee should have the right of of before he takes a job of making that decision there's just uh there's too many false positives and your your your privacy is is just taken away from you just you don't really have a a recourse if they say well it's it's do you have a positive you know and you say well no that's not really true and they say well okay well here you have to go and and here you go pee in the bottle and and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if if if if if if it what happens this time and they they just that the testing part part of it is just really bad is i didn't i didn't really i don't really know much about this are i didn't realize that false positives were such a risk yeah they are they are they it's one of the reason is because of the cost and when you have such a magnitude of people and you have a company and you're trying to you're trying to stay afloat and you're you're you're you're having to get these tests and these tests are very expensive so what happens is that uh-huh sometimes you get so you're getting through a a testing company that's that's we would might say just for terms is fly a fly by night company something like  oh let's see um crimes and circumstances actually i'm i'm against capital punishment um probably not for the reasons that a lot of people are i'm against it because i really don't think that uh there are any crimes that warrant executing a person and the reason i think that is because i really don't have the belief that uh any particular person's life is worth so much that you ought to take this other guy's life for it i think you can either you know put him in jail for you know for some very long period of time or if they're really you know mentally ill then i don't think they can really be held accountable for their actions anyway um-hum so uh i just i i'm just basically against it uh i also i also don't have enough faith in our our criminal justice system to to avoid getting the bloopers in there once in a while well that's probably a pretty good objection um yeah actually i'm i'm in favor of it um well this ought to be an interesting discussion uh um i my basic reason is that uh if someone uh willfully takes a life of another individual um i think that they have in most cases forfeited um their convention by which they agree to abide to when when they enter into society um you know they have there's a a convention that you know you shall not kill other individuals um and if you can kill with impunity um then that kind of makes you king of the hill in a society that that can't control you uh and if you've shown that that you have such an utter disregard for other individuals that that you kill uh cold-bloodedly or whatever then uh it's probably uh a good thing to remove remove you from that society um and one probably one of the more effective ways of of doing that is through the death penalty uh because it's a highly visible sort of action um and it also sends a message that you know this this sort of behavior is not tolerable within the society and you will forfeit all your rights uh if you engage in such activity uh-huh well is isn't locking somebody up i mean equivalent to that so well um yeah in a sense that you know that individual is removed from direct contact with society but that individual then becomes a burden to society a non productive burden yeah do you i uh because they'd sit there and i mean their quality of life is horrible uh because they're rotting away in a jail uh and the taxpayers are paying you know for them to sit there and twiddle away and and make license plates or something yeah yeah actually see i'm i'm sort of uh there are there are some other things i'm against i'm against also i think i think that jailing people for a really long period of time is is tantamount to sort of cruel and unusual punishment which i'm also against well yeah so and so so i'm sort of in this quandary you know i mean either you have either either you execute them and uh you're done with it or you know you throw them you throw them in jail for some incredibly long period of time and then i think well i wouldn't you know you you don't want to be cruel to these guys and they say by throwing them in a jail where they're you know they're constantly abused or what other other brother or uh other other cell mates you know um-hum so so you kind of get into this hotel phenomenon you know where you got to set up you know some incredibly safe rubber room but you know then when you set up the rubber room you know it's so uh it's so antiseptic that it's almost drives the person crazy if he isn't crazy already and so isn't that cruel and unusual punishment right right exactly exactly um on on the other hand i think there a lot of individuals who probably haven't really signed up to the idea of you know our concept i mean most western people's concept of civilization you know um-hum and i i mean western in the sense of just you know western philosophy i guess um okay but you know i i kind of don't buy into the idea that uh that to have a society you necessarily have to to you know terminate somebody if they have stepped across that line because i think there are probably a lot of instances where um you get into a situation where somebody hasn't really signed up to being in that society and i mean they kind of consider it almost they're protecting themselves or something and if society well for instance if society sort of forces themselves on somebody you know you hear it once in a while you hear about these incidences where uh how so uh some guy is you know off there in the wilderness or something you know and and and he just doesn't wanna be part of society um-hum and society kind of invades his turf you know makes him wanna or you know makes him makes him sort of abide by their rules when he really wasn't even known to society before and he winds up you know shooting somebody or you know killing a cop who's trying to get him to you know come in to pay his there's a million there's a million things you know that i can imagine million scenarios that i can imagine where the guy would be sort of like hey i don't wanna be in this society you know leave me alone you know and he'd fight back and if he killed somebody you know he'd get the death penalty you know  um i don't know um does your do you have recycling in Atlanta uh yeah i see seen some uh there's some trucks that come around kind of like garbage trucks they have like four different big containers on them and they'll go and uh and collect collect it but i think the i think it's pretty expensive to do uh-huh do you have to do you have to do the sorting or do they do the sorting for you well from i can tell what i've seen of it they have different color containers and uh you sort of sort it out uh in your home and then put it out on the curb and they and they just throw the matching color uh um-hum into the different box container yeah yeah yeah up here like New Hampshire doesn't uh well where i am uh we don't have any recycling we don't even have a bottle bill or anything like that and that's uh-huh that's not real that's not real popular with the states around us because yeah the the extra nickel or what is it extra thirty cents for a for a for six bottles everybody everybody comes across the border to buy the cheaper the the cheaper drinks yeah yeah but i i i i think that well i do some recycling like i save my my bottles and things like that but i don't think i do as as much i think i could do more yeah and i there's a big problem here with like landfills yeah uh like they the the landfills are just are just like filling up with stuff uh-huh and i think that if if they were to recycle if i were to i guess if if there was like some kind of a program i would do it because just so that we could save the space in those things yeah well uh it's kind of funny i saw um a special on a public public broadcasting station down here and uh they were talking about recycling and they they uh i i forgot exactly where this was but they were showing just piles and piles of plastic and glass that uh was at a recycling center but it was costing them uh about forty dollars a ton to recycle and they could only get about ten dollars a ton for it yeah so so you know there was just uh no nothing in it for them i i was and uh i i don't know when i was in when i i was last year i went to a class and and uh we would we they they brought it this guy that uh that made let's see he made he made a lot of money working because because like in in the states like Massachusetts and Vermont and all the states around New Hampshire they put in this bottle bill do you have a bottle bill down there i'm not sure i that's where it's like every every every every can is stamped with like a a nickel return on it oh and it's like you you have to like if you can turn the can in to to any store and they have to pay you a nickel for it um-hum but what happens is that then all these cans come running you know some stores get more cans than they sell and they have a big problem with that but yeah yeah the law says that if they sell they have to collect yeah but anyway this guy like all the like the beer distributors were having like the biggest problem and uh um-hum he he he actually like made a business that just went around from like distributor to distributor uh collecting like all the cans and he said like some things like the aluminum cans uh-huh they they could make money on because aluminum can be they can just throw that back into the pot right and that just gets melted back up and that's not a problem but um like the plastic ones you said like you were saying they they lost like big money on because they can't recycle they can't reuse the some plastics can be reused but most plastics can't be remelded remolded or melted melted into into other things uh-huh and it just becomes more of a pain than it's worth yeah but i don't know i i wonder you know should should they be making things that like just can't be reused yeah uh it kind of i i don't i don't and well should i be buying things that can't be reused yeah yeah it's uh uh something i think about a lot too is you know when you're buying everything is you know if it's not convenient people don't want it and usually convenience means waste i yeah well you know i i can't something i can't figure out is it do you every do you every did you ever see those big old Coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green yeah yeah at at what point in time did it get to be at what you know i didn't i thought they were great but at what point in time did it get to be worse yeah  so you don't oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost you know there there's a there's a there's a trade off of our civil rights against i guess our employer's right to to having a good job or something uh i don't don't really see the employers as having a whole lot to do with it i've already it the um privilege of being a victim of random drug testing i spent four years in the Marine Corps and had to pee in a bottle on command um-hum and it was really a really aggravating and time wasting thing to do um the thing that i really hated most about it was the total waste behind it all they would get maybe between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would you know we'd lose the whole morning what is that that's a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me i wasn't happy with it at all in fact after i got out i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesn't seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate um concern over somebody being under the influence while they're at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well yeah uh well that's that's a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isn't this isn't exactly disagreement with i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that there's a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is they're they're on now that's implying that um as a punitive kind of a thing as well you definitely want to discourage that is that kind of what you're saying well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that there's there's an even greater chance that they're they're going to get caught um having drugs that that that that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dad's in the other room perhaps you're going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because he might be coming in any minute you know yeah well i guess that's a good policy then if uh you're definitely for eradicating drugs from society i'm not so certain that that's a a worthwhile goal right now it looks like there's a lot of problems with um you know keeping drugs illegal things that are really scary a lot of people are dying and there's a lot of bloodshed and that that disturbs me i live downtown and uh man um-hum right diagonal across from campus is uh Teakwood Homes it's the oldest housing project in the country Roosevelt opened it and man there's shootings in there nightly and if it wasn't for the uh you know the the high profit margin i don't think it would be going on i don't think that uh we'd have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well there's at least one nasty bloody violent crime per year um over here where one of the students is a victim well the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um uh-huh in thinking that that it's we're not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park is that the park yeah and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the Swiss have they decided to close it down yeah i just saw that in the news here recently so uh i don't know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there aren't going to that there isn't a perfect solution yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US the consequences of that and it's ultimate uh repealment that's a good point that's a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down yeah and it's funny how today in movies and all we really glorify those gangsters and that lifestyle it's kind of spooky yes we do we do i guess i guess even today in today's movies a lot  ever um hello hello yeah okay so we're started i guess i'll press press one again um-hum there uh i'm surprised it's not telling us that that uh we're going but at any rate um had do you have such a program uh where you work okay no i don't and uh i can't say that i'm unhappy that we don't uh or happy you know either way i guess not being not being involved in it uh well i'll tell you the truth when it uh when it was introduced to Texas Instruments it was a lot of hard feeling now my initial reaction was benign i uh really didn't feel as a matter of fact i was sort of sympathetic in the sense that uh uh you know we we want to stamp out um drug use um-hum uh and uh the it's certainly no good for the company to have employees who are on drugs um-hum um and i don't really consider it uh an invasion of privacy uh in the sense because uh drug use is uh a dangerous influence on other people in society um-hum um there was i was in with a group of fuzzy heads however who um were rabidly opposed to it and i i gradually became um-hum proselytized uh by this group and the to me the big sensitive thing is well there there're couple things one is the is the insult of it perhaps as a um preemployment test is one thing but to come in post facto and say to uh employees who are tried and proven uh that they've been asked to do they're gonna have to submit to drug test is sort of a slap in the face um-hum oh yeah you know i might i might see a case as well where it might be warranted in um someone who obviously had a problem with it um someone who had um well i won't say behavioral problems but uh you know noticeable signs or you know got caught on the job you know uh in that case if they really wanted to help the employee it's sort of an enforced uh enforced clean period um but you know and of course there're problems with doing that you realize because uh this requires a very strong minded management and uh uh a supervisory it requires the supervisor to be brass balled in in a sense to go to a an employee who appears to possibly be under the influence of drugs and say you've got to take a drug test yeah i'd uh as opposed to just randomly requiring it of everyone that's true that that sort of singling singling a person out i guess i could see that side it of it as well well you can see i really haven't given it a whole lot of thought i'm i work for a privately held uh uh systems integrator and uh we are family oriented as a company and uh we we don't have uh any any problems that uh anyone knows about if you know what i mean there may be problems but no one is aware of them so it it's sort of a an invisible thing for us um um-hum right there's no real requirement for it um i did work for a company where i had to take a psyche profile once but uh that's another story was that on a need on a need basis or no all uh uh um everybody had to take one oh i see all right but uh thank you very much that's uh that's another that's another matter entirely but yeah i guess uh i guess i would say now now that now that uh you've presented that case i would have to say that uh random if if it were gonna be done random would be the only way to do it otherwise you're unfairly singling someone out uh right um i guess the other objection that i was exposed to at Texas Instruments was the um unproductive unproductive nature of it that basically uh drugs is not a problem at Texas Instruments and the corporation i think are going through this exercise mainly to remain in the good graces of their customer the government um-hum uh rather than to improve their productivity by stamping out drug use because the the likelihood of finding drug users in the TI population is very very low oh sure you have to be sharp and um and so uh people saw it as actually sort of a passing on of the the testing uh requirement from the government  okay so well what kind of uh programs do y'all have up there for recycling um around here we can recycle almost anything um we have paper and cans and uh newspaper i guess um-hum um and then i guess plastic and glass it's a little harder to do but you we can recycle those as well is there a curbside service or do you have to take it to a distribution or a collection center there's curbside but um for items like glass and and plastic it's only like once every three weeks or something crazy like that oh okay so you have to know what night they're doing it and you're not allowed to put anything out any other night so right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of plastics um but it's not real convenient like you said for lots of other things um and it it is kind of nice though because you can put everything in together and you don't have to sort it out which is nice right oh yeah so you don't have to split anything up no oh okay uh you just they gave us a little bin and you put everything in it there's a little separate top basket thing for the newspaper which is convenient but if you want to recycle anything other than their list you know good luck well uh-huh um we have a couple of collection places around but they're pretty inconvenient to get to and and those you do have to sort and and most people don't have room you know in their house for ten or twenty different bins for all the different sorting things you have to do right well i uh the last place i lived was really it was in New Jersey as well but it was um it was really a lot hard harder to do it because um it's different depending on what town you're in basically every town is different which i think that that's crazy that it should be coordinated by the state or something but right well what's kind of interesting is here when the program started they yeah made a big deal about it but they only gave it to like five thousand houses which in Atlanta is nothing you know and it was interesting because it was the only reason we got it is because we're sort of on the outskirts of this uh-huh right rather plush area so you can tell where they put the recycling uh program in place so Atlanta really hasn't spread it out very much at all yet i don't think um i guess are you are you budgetary restraints oh yeah are you living at school or are you outside of school um no i live off campus oh okay so it's not just the school that's doing it or yeah pretty far off right no it's it's the city the school Georgia Tech has it's own well has been trying to get it's own recycling program uh uh operated through the student government okay but there they've tried and tried to get an area allotted to them for a collection center and the school keeps saying no because uh there's a lot of people in in town homeless people who collect cans right right for a living and they're afraid that that's going to attract crime onto campus having a ready supply of cans oh okay i thought they were afraid of putting them out of work or something no well i don't know what what you know what their their philosophy was on that okay but uh that so they it's kind of a crime that we have all these students wanting to do this and no no cooperation to to get that program going right but a a friend of mine and i had also thought a while back about doing some recycling on our own to make some money and i think it was interesting i found out that glass is only worth like a penny a pound um-hum and when you start figuring how much glass you need to make you know if you figure you can fill a big trash can with glass and get a hundred pounds well that's great but that's a dollar so it's not a real profitable thing for for people to do yeah well not for individuals but like my company uh started doing recycling because it became mandatory in the state i i think it was mandatory in the state but they did it and they started a recycling program uh-huh just of paper i guess right and in two years they saved like four million dollars wow um they that's how much money they got paid for their paper yeah well now i know that i know that the same thing applies for aluminum it's much more profitable than glass and uh-huh um but i just thought you know we had thought wow this would be a nice little sideline because there's every we'd been going out to the bars around here and we'd asked at three different places and nobody recycles uh-huh so we thought well you got this ready market you know right these bars with all this glass and beer bottles and yet there's there's almost no way you could make money at it right because the labor and the cost of gas would eat up any profit you'd make because glass is you know but i'm sure that as far as aluminum uh-huh  so do you work for an employer who uh gives you health benefits yeah we get um i have i have good health benefits actually oh yeah yeah i have uh all of them and they're it's pretty cheap per month and they i get to pick my own doctor and they have really good benefits uh-huh uh um do you have any any interesting benefits aside from basic health coverage uh besides basic uh no i have um some a little bit of uh life insurance benefits um do uh do you get any kind of dental or optical coverage uh no the the uh no optical the dental is fully covered um uh-huh except unless it's major uh-huh but anything minor or just checkups that's all covered and uh is your whole family covered or do no that's just me but they can be i have that option but it's more money uh-huh but they're not they have their own i see so through your husband or oh no me i'm single it's just through me uh-huh oh i see it's it's uh so it's and it that makes it cheaper too since i'm single okay do but do you have children no no oh okay so that's real simple yeah here uh yeah it's just for the individual and if you want to cover your family you pay a little extra but not much yeah not much not for the good but it's really good the benefits are good uh yeah i think it's pretty significant benefit uh really uh um-hum makes you wanna stick around yeah yeah they have they uh it does yeah that's just what you wanna hear about uh people who are individually insured you know once you get sick you can be booted right out yeah um-hum yeah uh which seems kind of unfair uh do do you work where you have benefits like that yeah yeah we have we can choose uh a couple different plans they made they try to make it real flexible where if you don't use much you actually get cash back oh really um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an HMO uh well i used to have that when i was single and i was i found it very convenient uh and we have some optical and dental coverage that's i guess it's optional but i think we can get one pair of glasses a year yeah the um-hum yeah really well that's good that's so yeah it's pretty good actually uh i think a anything under a hundred dollars we can get one pair of glasses a year but if you want something really fancy you pay the difference uh-huh see that's see i wear glasses not all the time but when i read and stuff and um i wish we had some kind of optical uh-huh coverage but there's yeah it's nice there's none whatsoever and it can get expensive yeah it can uh at least it's not like medical where it can really go through the roof you know at least somewhat limited um yeah let's see you have any kind of uh child care benefits or um yeah for the um actually if you're i believe i i read up on some of it if you're pregnant anything in uh-huh they have really really good coverage they have um like well baby care it's it's pretty much covered uh-huh that's a problem sometimes i understand when the baby's not sick but you know you have these periodic appointments and um-hum especially when they're younger yeah the doctors end up having to come up with some ailment to cover the uh yeah the appointment even though there's not really one um-hum yeah some seems more honest and though and the pregnant mother has uh full coverage for well mother care uh-huh well that's good that's good and do is there any kind of interesting uh what i mean what happens after the baby's born is there some uh some maternity leave policy um that's what i was trying to i think there is i don't really remember how long it is uh-huh but they do give you a certain amount of time to be home and get adjusted i guess uh and um most of the benefits are pretty good the hospital benefits and and they let you pick your own doctor you have your choice actually if um it's better they give you a list uh-huh and if and if your doctor's on that list then most of your benefits are better because those doctors are in a chain that works with the insurance company i see so they they're preferred providers or is that a yeah but you can have your own doctor right and you pay a little more or certain things aren't as well covered but at least you have that option yeah yeah um-hum that's nice because once in a while you find someone who deals specifically with you know what you have or or somebody just somebody you've dealt with already a um-hum yeah and and a lot of times because we just switched my company my uh company just switched insurance companies and before and uh-huh we did not have that choice uh-huh  any so how do you get most of your news well i kind of uh i watch the um national news everyday for one i also read one or two papers a day and i'm a i'm pretty much a news junkie and i tune in to CNN a lot oh wow so when you say the morning news or evening news or national news is when uh every evening at six thirty i believe i watch the national news oh okay well i would probably be a junkie or something watch CNN a lot but i don't uh i don't uh subscribe to cable because because of the poor service and also uh uh-huh because well i uh i give to the United Way and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that uh-huh as opposed to paying for cable yeah i take away a uh a addiction or something yeah well i uh overall i i the quality of the news you get off off of most uh sources i would say is pretty low it's usually you get pretty incomplete coverage and that's one of the reasons where i why i try and get as many sources as possible because if you hear the same story from three different sources then you get a much clearer picture of of what is going on you would hope it's still you know hard to say that what you've heard is what really is oh what what uh newspapers do you read well i read uh the local newspaper and i also try and read one of the uh major dailies like the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times or something like that uh for a while there i i i uh subscribed to New York Times actually actually a couple of newspapers because uh you know my fiance well she was unemployed for a while so she you know really needed to look at the the want help wanted ads and so often they they try the newspapers are trying to compete with a lot of other sources of newspaper of news uh-huh right and i don't know New York Times is okay but um i don't know when you read a lot of this stuff the the quality of the writing is definitely gone down in the last ten years or so but uh-huh uh i mean they they say it's like the sixth grade reading level but i swear it's at least second or third grade sometimes right pretty low but i don't know um i think if if you listen to like NPR or something like right i i really like NPR a lot that's pretty good um and i like listening to that on on uh when i get a chance when i'm in the car a long enough time to to listen to it because i right yeah i miss NPR a lot also i really like them because they give uh instead of being as your newspaper or your TV news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb they go really in depth on topics which i think is good and they also uh their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than say your major network news and that kind of thing well McNeil Lehrer McNeil and Lehrer i guess he's leaving one of them is leaving uh-huh uh they're they're pretty good too um i guess a year ago you're probably watching CNN a lot right had that invasion or whatever it is right yeah sure was uh but i i don't know i guess a lot of it's still a lot of hype look at the the Smith trial i mean that was a joke uh uh-huh yeah that was but then you also have things where you uh where they broadcast the Clarence Thomas hearings basically the whole length of them which i thought was really really good oh yeah the NPR doing that yeah i know the i had uh some visitor and he was just in just i don't know fixated on that you know just listened to it constantly uh-huh um and i guess that's good when it's live if you if you'll really want that but that's not really providing you news it's it's more like a media event rather than reporting right well but the but the news news news that you would get from any other source is being generated from that event which is something that's good also about C-SPAN which i i tune into every once in a while oh really that's kind of boring to me i think yeah it it is really kind of boring but you know that's if if you don't watch it there then you're going to hear somebody else's canned uh report somebody else's view about it and that's what you're supposed you're supposed to if you watch the news you're going your opinion is going to be formed about on what somebody else thought about it as opposed to actually watching it yourself and forming your own opinion opinion which i haven't would be much more in favor of forming my own opinion as opposed to following someone else's yeah yeah i guess that's true but uh one of the ways that i get information is uh everyday when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this this thing it's free inside the company and it's called Intellect and and they basically uh type out abstracts which are really really literally i've i've actually read the actual articles they're pretty good  okay supposedly we're recording right now uh it's kind of interesting because nearly thirty minutes ago i was reading an advertisement for the new Infinity i forget what model number it was but one of the features they were touting was a freon free air conditioning system that's interesting i hadn't seen that i know there was a lot of talk about freon contributing to the the uh hole in the ozone layer and other various pollution but uh other than uh making the air conditioning systems tighter i didn't know that there was any work on uh alternate coolants yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too um actually i was kind of i'm surprised kind of surprised that that has become as much of an issue as it has because you know we know these things are designed to be closed systems either whether the problem's due to leaks or due to failures i would think that um um-hum yeah if it was designed with reasonable prudence stuff wouldn't get loose and um i mean you don't want it to it's not cheap and the thing fails when it does so i'm kind of surprised it became as much of an issue as it has the uh the the times that i've seen any sort of of loss is uh at a time when maybe i'd have uh the the uh freon checked in the air conditioner or maybe topped off and it seemed to me that they'd practically waste almost as much as uh they'd put in the car but i've noticed in the past few years that uh the controls on that are um tighter uh people are a lot more concerned about that um-hum yeah so what what do you what do you see as the other biggies being in that realm you know what else could be something that is a bad thing well obviously cars uh and trucks contribute quite a bit and personally i'll uh i carpool uh most of the time with someone i work with but my schedule doesn't uh doesn't make for a consistent carpool yeah yeah i um traded cars recently and went from a car that got seventeen miles per gallon of worth of on on premium and didn't really wasn't happy with premium wasn't high enough to a car that gets about twenty four miles per gallon on uh the cheapest garbage you can put in it so i probably contributed my share there and um kind of interesting course um there is talk about legislation that would ban the manufacture of an engine that required leaded fuel at some point and um this i believe has i read has put the general aviation uh world going nuts because a general aviation engine can cost in the neighborhood of thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars to overhaul and if it flies a hundred hours a year um-hum that's moderately high so the amount of dollars spent per unit of pollution saved um are very very tiny as compared to a car where it's a relatively inexpensive engine and it's running for a lot longer per year um so it's a question of um now apparently uh the EPA thought about this again and decided that these that that general aviation engines won't count and they'll allow them to continue to burn leaded fuels but there's some concern over if this is the only market is anybody gonna wanna bother making leaded fuels that's a that's a good question uh the leaded fuels have obviously been out of the automotive industry for quite some time and there's always talk about uh about regulating the emissions that a a car engine can produce and tightening down on that and of course the uh the large auto makers in this country spend untold millions to lobby to keep business just the same as usual it's an old joke about the uh finest Congressman money can buy sounds like another issue um you know i've always viewed it as um the pollution issue as a property rights issue if um somebody dumped their garbage in your front lawn um regularly you'd have legal recourse but if he dumps it into the air surrounding your house you really don't have any and um i think therein lies a big part of the problem is that it's it's viewed a little differently from physical pollution there's a big issue in Rhode Island right now uh there's a company that wants to build a coal fired uh energy plant very close to to downtown Providence and they are pulling all sorts of tricks to maneuver around various controls and inspections and regulations apparently the the regulations  well Toby have you ever served on a jury in a criminal trial no i've always wanted to and uh but they never uh my name never seems to come up well i'm not sure whether you're the lucky one or i am because i have done it and uh uh what did you think of the process well we had a hung jury so i i came away really disappointed in the process or the least the people involved i was very frustrated about that how hung was it i mean what was the vote i i think it was something like oh ten to three ten to two or nine to three or something like that uh-huh which really means that if if we hadn't of had to have unanimous decision we would uh would have completed our mission if you will yeah yeah but it's i don't know i i've always thought that the fact the the fact that it has to be unanimous means that there wasn't any doubt in people's minds and if it uh if in like in your case if there's two people who who weren't convinced that the fellow was guilty then or innocent i you didn't say which way it went i think it was ten people no it's the funny it can go either way if there's two people that aren't convinced one way or the other then that's um you know i don't i think one one change that might be worthwhile would be to say that you need unanimous verdict to find somebody guilty but but if you don't get a unanimous guilty verdict then they're innocent because the prosecution didn't prove their case to all twelve people yeah um well the the crazy thing about this trial was that the guy said yes i did this i did this armed robbery but he wanted a jury to decide his sentence and we couldn't even agree on a sentence huh huh i i mean i was ready to put the guy guy away forever but i was dealing with people who said well if it were my son i'd want him to have another chance i know that's ridiculous um here in Georgia the only time that the jury gets involved in sentencing at all is in capital punishment cases oh is that right otherwise the judge does it the judge does all sentencing for everything except capital cases here do you think that's appropriate or should it be changed i think it is appropriate i think that the judge probably has a much better uh feel for uh what sentences other people who have committed comparable punishment crimes have received and what the guidelines are and uh i i think that by the time you get to that point all the facts have been settled the person's been convicted and the punishment should be well a fairly objective uh thing uh i don't know if there really needs to be all that much discretion in sentencing once you've determined what crime the person is guilty of yeah well and i do not know if it is this way it all states or not but in Texas there are severe limitations on what the jury can know know about the the prior history of the alleged criminal um-hum and also what they can be told about the effects of sentencing Like if you give somebody fifteen years they'll be out in three weeks or something like that i maybe it's not quite that radical but but those things are not those are things are kept from the jury yeah here in Georgia when they have the jury involved in sentencing like in a capital case the prosecution is not allowed to say that if you if you give them life he'll be out in seven years that's against the rules yeah why uh but in with the judge making all the other sentences uh course the judge has open to him all of the previous criminal history uh uh and uh obviously the judge knows what all the guidelines uh or what all the effects can be of parole and things like that uh-huh um well i think the the the reform of the jury process that i would like most to see is for juries to be required to be informed of their right to judge not only the facts of the case but also the law itself uh juries and lot of people are not aware of this but it is it's part of the common law and it they really is in Georgia it is part of the state Constitution and it is in the Constitution of a lot of states that if the jury uh believes that the law that someone is being tried on is unjust the law itself is unjust the jury can refuse to convict the person uh and this is sort of the people's uh last line of defense against governments huh  so do you exercise yeah i just started about uh two months ago consistently doing it um well that's good yeah i uh i walk jog three times a week for about an hour oh huh yeah so i've just gotten up to um being able to jog one and a half to two miles and then um about mile and a half of walking yeah so well i do a lot of walking at work because i'm outside a lot so oh oh okay what kind of work do you do i'm in the Air Force oh okay so i'm outside a lot i work on airplanes so i do a lot of walking there yeah okay so you consider that your exercise uh yeah yeah uh but i need to work on getting into an exercise program really hum what kind of exercise program would you think you might want to get into uh just basically the the uh uh up my uh you know heart rate and respiration and stuff just to keep it um-hum going because i've noticed i've been getting a little tired lately maintain it oh well what kind of things do you like to do like um do you like to run or play a sport or well i kind of bicycle ride i kind of like bicycle riding and and running a little bit i don't you know really particular like running but um-hum yeah well it's kind of hard on the joints yeah there's a lot of other things to do um-hum bicycle riding is pretty good for you yeah you don't have to put any um shock no it doesn't shock your joints or there's no pounding or anything yeah huh yeah so you think you might get an exercise bicycle oh i might i got a a regular bicycle out in the oh out in the garage but it's it's been kind of raining and stuff around here lately so there ain't been much of a chance to go riding a bicycle yeah yeah that's the problem with with that is like if you wanna be consistent and then the weather's bad you can't really or get out when it's cold or whatever yeah yeah yeah so i have an exercise bike at home but i don't use it it just kind of sits there in the corner yeah but you got a good exercise program going on it looks like but yeah and the reason that i'm doing it is because i have a friend doing it with me otherwise i wouldn't have the motivation yeah so your motivation is having somebody do it with you yeah well it's you know i'm a student and i'm in school all day and i'm really tired the end of the day and a lot of times i just wanna go home yeah you know and and eat but knowing that my friend's waiting for me you know i meet her at the stadium where we work out um yeah it makes me go and then after i do it i i'm glad i went and i enjoy it and i have more energy yeah after you do it yeah so and we encourage each other so yeah well i went on a trip once and me and the the guy i went with we went to the gym three times a week and worked out so oh that's great that i got into that and then when i got back home i just couldn't keep into it because yeah you know it's it's hard you let other things get in the way and and the you're busy yeah yeah and if you have a family and yeah i got one son and he kind of keeps me a little busy around the house and yeah it's kind of hard to it's like you have to schedule a time and stick to it but it's hard when yeah you don't have somebody to do it with you it's easy to just say well i'm not gonna do it today but i'll do it tomorrow and then you never do it yeah that's and plus my work schedule because there's times i go in at all different hours and it's kind of hard to keep a steady um-hum oh yeah that would be tough so yeah well that's what hurts me a lot about getting into a exercise program um-hum yeah well maybe you can you can um i don't know do a lot of walking like you are and do calisthenics or something i don't know yeah or get an exercise bike and in the house yeah well i've been looking at them uh Nordic Tracks oh yeah i hear they're supposed to be pretty good huh huh yeah i have a friend that has one and she said it's really really good it works a lot a lot of your muscles yeah um-hum and uh she just does it thirty thirty minutes three times a week oh and that's not too much time no not really well that's part of what the brochure said too you know twenty thirty minutes a day and or three times a week or however yeah yeah um-hum you see if you just keep that up you know that's not too much time and then i bet it'll really improve your you know your cardiovascular system and and all of that because they say even if you just do that it increases yeah your life span i don't know how much but  okay okay i thought it was supposed to give a recording but anyway um well i i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for for my wife and for me and um um-hum i embarrassed to say it's pretty trivial all we all i do is uh keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month but i doubt i do it more than three times a year um-hum do you use a computer and no i work with them all day yeah i'm in computer science yet i i do everything on paper uh i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers oh uh-huh yeah mine is really simple because i got all our bills paid off when um he was a Marine he went to Saudi Arabia and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off so really the only bills i have is rent utilities insurance um-hum you know so they come in i pay them and that's it you know that's about the extent of it you know yeah i i don't really have this major budget or anything i just really i'm real thrifty i take care of you know two children and me and um just real careful with the money you know um-hum what little we have so that's what i do yeah it's a pretty straightforward it's almost i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making no you know fancy budgets it seems like if you're getting to that level you're you're not in real good control huh-uh you know i mean i i i've never liked credit cards and a lot of debt you know you buy something on credit and you pay twice as much for it when you get done uh-huh yeah you know so actually i'm i mean i like using credit cards for everything but just paying off the bills uh-huh because that way it's a record of everything and i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else because they come in at the end of the month i don't have too many weaknesses i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them uh you know it's so much easy easier you know if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person it's like oh well that's on sale let's go grab it you know so um hum and if you don't have the money then use the credit card so i got rid of them credit cards yeah i guess if that's you know if that's a weakness that's a good thing to do yeah that was my weakness it wasn't bad i mean i didn't have like thousands of dollars you know and like that just i just learned that that wasn't for me you know um-hum sure so but i self employed you know i have my own little cleaning business type thing so um i keep do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that or no it's not hard i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and um you know what it's gonna have to go for that month and uh-huh you know it's not that not that hard not at all well that's good to know so i always do my own income tax you know do you yeah i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to to do it huh it seems like it's absurd the number of people who had to having to pay somebody to do it read all you got to do is read a book mean read the little book they send you fill in the blanks and go i mean it seems absurd that people will pay you know some bucks just to get someone to i yeah just the form yeah yeah and a lot of them it's dumb you know i guess if you had some really complicated stuff but i don't so i don't mess with it yeah but i don't use a calculator either you know i don't i don't have that much that many you know things to add up so i i don't trust myself with using a calculator or computer to too much stuff like that because i wanna make sure that that i i keep on top of the numbers and understand what's going on i know too many people who use a calculator if they make a mistake they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention oh yeah and and we have a i i bank at NCNB here and they have a number that you can call in and i always call in like once every other week or so and i will um check off what checks have cleared and do you do that yeah we have the same thing you do too and i always check them off and you know check my balance and my book and you know because i always want to know exactly what i have yeah you know i do that real often sure i do that so anyway  okay uh let's see when it comes to to uh sentencing i i'm a little confused because the the only things that i read about sentencing and juries well the only things i know are the things that i read and the things that i read are are either how should i say it they're they're written by people that that have an axe to grind so if somebody thinks that the judge is judges are too lenient why i read all kinds of let's throw them all in jail and then if i i've you know i've i've read other things that i i wish i could see a uh an informed uh discussion as opposed to just what i see these days as one side you know some one side's mad uh-huh and uh so i uh i i guess what i'm trying to say is uh i have mixed feelings because sometimes i think that the judges um are overstepping their bounds and they shouldn't be the the juries should be the only ones that uh have a say in it and other times i think well no the juries are out of hand the judges need to step in yeah uh you know the it comes down to a hard call because um i now i'm personally have never served on a jury uh i've been in school and so that's waived my jury duty and so exactly some of the procedures that they go through for the jury uh as far as sentencing goes i'm not real clear on but from i understand there's sometimes whenever the juries make the verdict i mean the uh the sentencing and sometimes they don't on the case i've remember reading a a discussion about a jury that that uh heard a case and they and they awarded uh uh how should i say it they agreed that the one person was guilty and they and they agreed that the fine should be so much and then the judge came along and set aside the judgement which the way the article was written was a terrible injustice oh really uh but like i say i uh there's i rarely see uh both sides of that i just hear about it from one side i don't hear the other side the the one thing that i am kind of upset about is the fact that juries are selected uh-huh uh to be the lowest uh how should i say this they have any opinions at all they're weeded out been one or the other of the uh of the lawyers oh yeah yeah and so to be honest with you i've i've uh i don't think that's right and if i ever am called to be a a juror and they ask me if i have strong opinions i'm i'm just i'm not you'll you'll probably be weeded out huh well i i i if i answer honestly if i answer honestly i'll be weeded out if i if i just like looked at him and say uh no i don't have strong opinions because i feel like you know i want to be part of the process uh-huh and uh like i say it bothers me that that the that the lawyers can weed anybody with a college education or anybody uh oh let's say with a with any college educations you know much schooling or certain uh uh backgrounds like for instance if you're a if you've go to church once a a a month or something like that why they don't want you on the jury or you know things like that it it bothers me that that that we're judging people on the basis of of uh what do you call it uh on on on what they do and and no well what i'm trying to say is the jury jurors are selected to basically be from what i've been told milk toasts if they have any opinions if they could understand anything an engineer could never be uh a juror for instance because he's he's uh he's not easily uh persuaded or or or how shall i say this this it's easy to hoodwink or it's it's hard to hoodwink him that kind of thing persuaded yeah yeah yeah so that's what i'm kind of worried about well i think in a way it also depends on what kind of trial it is um because sometimes you know if if it's dealing with with a more technical thing such as like a malpractice not not like a criminal suit you're going to have to have somebody that that can understand the uh like the medical or the legal implications right uh that's what you want but on the other hand if the lawyer thinks no i don't want a bunch of people in here who are going to be able to weed their way through you know uh you know to weed the good from the bad they will absolutely go for people who uh how should i say it the scrub the scrub women and the the janitors i'm i'm uh-huh uh-huh trying not to be prejudiced against them but you know any any education will disqualify you in in many cases i've been  okay so what are what are your views on on capital punishment i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is but on the other hand it is very very expensive to maintain you know Texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country yes and it's eating us alive budget wise and um so are they currently practicing capital punishment in your state yes we do practice capital punishment but the nature of the uh courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed yes that's similar to Georgia yeah and then i was reading in the paper just this morning it's interesting because i had forgotten i guess that i wrote this little topic down that it costs more to execute somebody than than it does to keep them that's probably true considering because of all the costs of the appeals and all that you know yes yes um i guess in a way that it it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if well i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people yes you know who would see it right that would be the intent of it yeah but i'm not sure how successful that is well i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner if there weren't so many appeals yeah if if the person who's gonna commit the crime knew that they were gonna be punished severely possibly capital punishment quicker maybe yeah um-hum what what kind of work do you do uh i'm a research engineer i work uh for with Georgia Tech hum well see i'm a school principal um elementary school yes and in a very poor section of town with predominantly predominantly Anglo kids and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals hum in spite of everything we can do and see i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people that i mean course you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there um-hum but i think if we would make a bigger investment in kids we'd have fewer decisions to make um that's probably true but i guess down the road you know there's other factors that but pumping pumping pumping more money into the school system is a good thing but it's not gonna oh yeah well i'm not talking about just in the school system oh i see see i'm talking about like in in uh i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared uh i know institutions don't work that well but it's a bad day because because i have all these kids through my office i have a school of five hundred and thirty seven kids um-hum five hundred of them are good solid kids and i have the same thirty seven in my office every day um and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible some of them in the penal system so that's a difficult situation and you know you just see those kids going down the road now not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment but some of them have already been in youth centers um and that kind of thing and if we had something to do before they get to be full blown adult criminals and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action um-hum i think that's one reason we have problems in school systems uh and some of them are our problems but a lot of it's because everything society wants we're supposed to do um-hum but that's another subject but well that's probably true what anyway i dealt with two or three kids today that are gonna end up where somebody has to make a decision what to do with them hum yeah i guess that's not an easy solution there's there's no easy solution for that um-hum i don't i don't know that there is an easy solution but if you could find a way to prevent some of it and i'm not sure what it would be um-hum it would be money better spent than do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to Harvard that's true i'm sure it is yeah statistically that's true hum yeah i don't i don't certainly capital punishment isn't gonna solve a lot of problems but um-hum are you for it uh i'm for it in in some cases yeah i guess i am for certain crimes yeah in certain crimes what kind of crimes would you do use it for um premeditated murder um-hum crimes of that nature i think should definitely any mass murderer type individual i i would consider it for sexual abuse of children on going you know not one instance but perpetual abusers of children hum um-hum well you always have castration well you know somebody elected that recently yes i read about that and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it you know um-hum but uh  so Julie how do you feel about AIDS research i think we need we definitely need more of it definitely i'd agree too but i mean it seems like it just makes economic sense in that you know um you know it would have made even better economic sense to to to have had a lot more research done a longer longer longer ago oh yeah yeah for certain you know because you know because um the country's gonna wind up paying for the treatment of patients exactly exactly does does like do do health insurance policies like for companies and things do they cover um-hum diseases like that i think they cover AIDS but what they do is um if you know you apply for for to get a a insurance policy they'll um check to see if you're HIV positive uh-huh and if you are not only will they not give you um a policy but they'll um they have like there's like you know a database of people that have tested positive so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again um well that's but that's why they should have started started doing stuff before i mean still you know since it's dormant for such a long time there's still probably a lot of people you know before the tests ever really came out who are who are draining a lot of money right now you know yeah i think a lot of it was was just that you know because because of of the audience you know because because the majority of the high risk groups were in people that no one really cared about right right that right and all these God fearing people were like well you know God is trying to kill off all the et cetera et cetera um-hum um-hum yeah um yeah one one one humorous one humorous retort i heard heard someone you know who claimed that you know AIDS was you know God's punishment was that then lesbians must be God's chosen people uh-huh yeah but um boy that's a good one so um yes um do you think we're do you mean do you think we're actually doing enough right now to no i really don't i did i did like a research kind of thing on AIDS research and stuff and uh really we're not doing much at all i mean most of what gets raised i mean it's not really federal movement most of what gets raised gets raised by um uh uh you know uh conscious yeah communities and things like that you know like uh San Francisco has uh private organizations um-hum a real um strong AIDS support group and all that kind of stuff and and uh get they get donations from the community you know they're real and from corporations around the around the city you know for AIDS research and that kind of thing um-hum um-hum um-hum and uh i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level you know rather than just in the places where it's you know where it's predominated so far because it's you know it's bound to spread um-hum i mean it seems that you know it's just you know of it's just gonna reach a steady a steady state a let a lot lot higher point than it will if we you know we'd nip it in the bud just to quote quote Barney Fife right yeah i don't know i don't know i I i don't know what the likelihood of that is there you know people really waking up especially with the ultra conservative um-hum move our our political system sort of seems seems to be taking uh-huh um-hum i would probably agree with that yeah yeah um so do do you think it's more important to spend money on research or for support of um people God that's a good question Fish i don't know um i think i think one of the main things that's really important to spend money on is education not support or or research per se but but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the the work place and out of society you know kind of like lepers would you know and it's really it's it's really not necessary um-hum um-hum uh until until the uh disease reaches its final stage you know becomes really infectious um-hum and uh uh uh i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people to understand you know try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that they're not you know they don't they don't have to be just completely um-hum cut off from from a community and that and uh um-hum i guess i think that that um research is i guess the most important just because i you know it it really needs to come to an end um-hum yeah i don't know i don't know Fish what do you think about that subject uh i think it's i think it stands a really interesting question of um  personally prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to uh to drive kind of fast i guess but i'm finding that as i get older i'm thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxurious luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have um-hum what kind of car do you have right now it's a uh Dodge Daytona it's a Shelby Z they only made them for for one year it's really just a variation on the other Daytonas that they have out but i'm real happy with it um-hum um-hum it's uh an eighty seven and it's the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i heard things about uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i haven't had any problems with it yeah i know my father-in-law has have a has a turbo charged uh engine on his truck and he's had some some problems with that oh really but um he put the turbo on himself and uh uh there was some problems right from the start with that uh-huh how old is uh how old is the truck well i think it's probably about an eighty seven also uh-huh excuse me but i guess my tastes in vehicles are just a little bit different um um i've been more into just kind of a family car small uh not real big car uh um-hum but lately we've been uh trying to get something that's a little bit more reliable so we've been going with uh Toyota vehicles lately uh-huh and i'm more into pick up trucks lately i i got myself uh myself a pick up truck last spring oh and i'm more interested in the the off road that kind of thing hauling things around oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep Wrangler uh um-hum and uh it's funny though because it's this is actually my wife's car the Jeep and uh but it's fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things um-hum but we're still finding that when we end up driving other people places that it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didn't have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel right which we do a a fair bit of traveling yeah i know we do a lot of that yeah on the road traveling and we we have a Toyota Camry for that kind of traveling oh yeah that's a little bit more comfortable it's it's not real fancy but it's a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles we've had prior to that yeah sure it's uh i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have um-hum but are you pretty satisfied with your Jeep as far as repair and reliability on it yeah we haven't had it for very long we got it in September right around uh Labor Day i guess it was and so it doesn't have a whole lot of miles on it yet um-hum but uh up here in Rochester New York it's nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like today where we have about six inches of snow coming down out there yeah yeah we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so yeah i was a little uh surprised to find i i'm not the sort of person that's going to go out and shop for exclusively for an American built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best is American um-hum made and American built but i was reading in the paper the other day that uh surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American aren't always and in fact they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either Mexico or Canada yeah which isn't that far away but i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that we've had because the Toyota we have now was built in i think Tennessee really and the uh before that we had a a Volkswagen Jetta which was made in Philadelphia or somewhere in Pennsylvania i think yeah so but you wouldn't think that just off the top of your head you'd think they're German or or Japanese made no yeah yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system uh decoding the vehicle identification number so you could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built yeah i read that in the paper the other day yeah found that interesting but it was interesting we used to have a Jeep a long time ago when we were first married and i i swore i'd never get one again because we had so many problems with it it was just a a a never ending uh stay at the the repair shop it just oh really oh no oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there  see i don't have much time myself for that kind of thing but uh i have my father was uh quite handy he died recently but uh um i have done limited things like for example i've built uh uh tree house for my kids and uh well that's a project i really enjoy doing it i just don't have the time um uh-huh so well we do a lot of our own repair just we enjoy doing it and uh kind of like you though it's finding the time to do it but oh things like uh the inside of the house i always do the it all the painting in it um-hum and uh in fact come think of it we did the outside the trim of the house and that turned out to be quite a job since we have a two story house um absolutely and uh well have you ever done any remodeling well not really we added a room upstairs or finished off a room upstairs but that was a that turned out to be quite a job too it was a game room and uh it took us a long time i mean i'm talking about a year to finish that you know it's very interesting my uh father and i built a a home a uh new home for ourselves from basically from the ground up when i was a teenager uh-huh and uh it's amazing how these things work one of my most um amazing amazing things is to me is that what appears to be the major part of the work basically putting the structure up happens very quickly um-hum but then you know comes the inside and the trim and the electrical work and the fixtures and the appliances and it seems like ninety percent of the time it was very frustrating takes a long time to get that house done uh-huh the fitting i think is what is took us so long you know the measurement and fitting it trying it taking it down fitting it again that um i see yeah uh so we have recently built on a a extra garage to our house and uh we had a lot of well we had the concrete and stuff poured first we didn't attempt that we talked about it but decided that was gonna be a bit much and uh but we did all the finishing out on it and my husband has a workshop in it or uh he races cars and we needed a spare garage there hm and that turned out to be quite a project uh we're looking at uh a lot of small things to do around the house now like uh i think we are on borrowed time on things like the hot water heater it's that we're gonna change out our self that uh um um-hum i've learned to do some plumbing do people change out these things before they fail or well we do because uh we've had one fail and it was quite a mess for us that uh-huh it can cause a lot of damage i know yes and so uh we can tell that it's going out because of the we're running out of hot water and stuff we'll have some it's an electric heater and uh we figure some of the burners or heated elements are going out and we priced them and kind of felt like it be just as cheap for us to go on and change it out and and be done with it than this waiting for it to flood us and like it did before um-hum and uh and you can get them at discount stores fairly cheap and uh we can do it ourselves it's not that much trouble just unscrewing a few pipes and screwing back some more yeah the small those small projects are manageable you know i i fix toilets and things like that but when it comes to major uh-huh uh projects putting in stairways uh in extra stairways or putting on an extra room or something like that i just absolutely do not have the time to do that um-hum well it is time consuming yeah the the frustrating thing is that i enjoy doing it oh um-hum but um you know i work twelve hours a day seven days a week as it is so i can't just don't have time for  so um you know my feeling is that uh it's really being used today it it you know it it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal right i think i've seen some statistics that say that uh it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life right because you you you've got all all the prison expenses plus all the legal expenses right um and you know it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent um for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes crimes that would be eligible you know really care well that's committing them mostly is you know either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or right i mean it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon you know i'm invulnerable i don't need to care about this you know i i i'm never gonna get caught yeah but yeah but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis for example someone like uh Jeffrey Dahmer do you want by putting him in prison for life there is still a possibility that he will get out again yeah one one way or another whereas if you kill him there is not that possibility yeah but but the other side to that is if you put him in prison for life there's a chance that he might do things in prison or you know and somehow redeem himself yeah i don't think he could ever redeem himself but in some cases yes well you you know so that you know the the question is you know the other question problem with capital punishment you run into is what are you gonna do about people who are later found to have been innocent you know there are cases where you know twenty thirty years after the fact they're getting evidence yeah especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence and then oops i'm sorry i guess we killed the wrong guy yeah it's it's yeah once you've made a decision that way it's a little difficult to go back on it right you you can apologize nicely but you know you know i think you know the the price you know it i've heard quotes you know it's better that a thousand people go free than one person be unjustly imprisoned i think it is really the the philosophy of the way our legal system works oh yeah yeah it's all the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is uh based on the uh person who is accused yeah and you know the i i think that you know and the way it's being used now it's like you listen to Bush's you know well where are we gonna impose drug you know it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in Tsongas is also saying you know capital make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer right and again i don't think these people care they risk their lives everyday yeah that there there they see that the profit margin of drug dealers the profit margin's so high that yeah the the risk is almost not there yeah and and you know uh especially you know i live in in Massachusetts you know we're we're we're gonna get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something yeah so you know but you look at our our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to to like Texas or someplace that does you know it it it's impossible to make a case that it's it's affecting it in any way i think it's mainly people like they get the vengeance of it yeah well it's also i used to live in Georgia and you know the the big thing down there was all right we have capital punishment because you know but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed it's very racially related and ethnically related oh yeah it's mainly lot of blacks also a lot of young people you know your a a a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen right and you know i i think when you listen to like the uh the the victims' families and things they're always talking about you know uh feeling justified or feeling you know like they've gotten something out of it i mean my thought has been once the guy has been imprisoned if he goes to jail forever or whatever or if he gets killed it shouldn't make any difference to the uh to the victim's family the only thing that should really i mean obviously if someone of mine who was close died i'd probably feel differently but right you know the you know what the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society right and that and you know also by keeping them in prison you do have the possibility though we don't currently do this of making restitution right i mean the you you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family right and the the other thing is that you know i was reading through a book on uh genome human genome research and now more and more things like schizophrenia um-hum and what if it just turned out to be genetic or biochemical in origin so if someday we can go to Jeff Dahmer and say well the problem is you you've got an endorphin imbalance and you know if you take this regularly you'll be a sane and productive member of society right uh-huh you know you really get back to the question of you know is someone responsible for their actions yeah well i i think on some of it you have to say someone's responsible for his actions i never like the uh society made me do it yeah the defense that well i never liked the uh insanity defense  well i've recently dropped my subscription to the local paper well not exactly local it's a pretty big one the Atlanta Journal Constitution because i was thoroughly and totally disgusted with the quality of the paper was really pretty poor and i couldn't see spending half an hour a day looking through that yeah i did the same thing actually i uh don't have a i'm not subscribing anymore yeah i try and watch the news as well we get uh cable here and watch Headline news but it's such a i don't know there's really very little depth to it they seem to be really out to try and entertain more than uh you know pass on any real information it's pretty trashy i'm not happy with it are you unhappy with the uh with the how should i say it uh the one-sidedness of it or or the uh the i think more the uh the just the the real lack of meat behind it i think there was an article in some local news magazine recently that mentioned it talked about the uh uh level of uh reading ability or something or other and things like President Bush's uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with Michael Dukakis back during the old uh the the last election nonsense and they were talking about how Dukakis his statements were like in a tenth to twelfth grade reading level while Bush's were down around an eighth grade level and by that uh being able to convey to that larger much larger of an audience you know he was supposedly that much more an effective communicator and i think that's the same problem with the news is they're trying to communicate with maybe so many people that it's just coming out really pretty poor my my problem is that they just don't uh how should i say it i i can either get uh things on one side or the other but not uh a meaningful discussion um that relates to well how should i say i either get these highly polarized things yeah i agree and sometimes they're i say okay we're going to we're going to do uh uh we're going to be fair so we're going to present two highly polarized articles which which is uh better than than one but uh uh-huh yeah that's like uh trying to maintain a temperature in your house by running the heater and the air conditioner at the same time so uh anyway so we're uh one of the problems the other problem that i have is that that uh as you said uh a lot of the articles are they're either fluff uh well actually out of the press they're they're fluff or they're uh pretty shallow but yeah course i have i also have the option and i guess you do too of signing up for one of these uh specialty magazines which is like in the case of uh science you know you sign up for uh yeah they are good Nature or something like that but i'm surprised at the the the range and quality of things that are out there like Scientific American there's such a broad uh spectrum of science and yet it's really in depth at the same time but when it comes to news uh it's a i find it i i think the reason perhaps for that is that the uh the uh press like everything else is is becoming a uh how should i say is becoming they're not neighborhood uh press anymore yeah and national they're worried more they're more like U S A Today type things uh pretty shallow and and can we make it uh and they're run by you have ten newspapers that are run by uh held by the same company uh yeah yeah i agree we recently had Newsweek at the house but went ahead and dropped it decided it really wasn't what we were looking for and we started subscription to U S News And World Report but it hasn't started arrived yet going to try and evaluate that you know another interesting source of news is the is E-mail the network news do you get that oh yeah that's yes that's one of the most interesting that's how i found out about this yeah me too i really if if i when i move when i go to my next job i'm really going to be uh upset if i don't have access to that well there are some places here in town uh for people that are uh having uh withdrawal pains so to speak uh there's a bookstore that has a uh uh subscription type thing where you can pay the guy forty dollars a a year which is pretty small potatoes oh that's cheap and you get to call in across a modem yeah call in on the modem and you can read your news i mean read your mail and uh and uh look at the all the different internet uh oh man uh groups excellent yeah that really seems to be a a one of the cutting leading  um so what is your what why do you people don't vote in the elections well first of all i think they understated the turnout It's i don't i don't think that in a national election it's ever been under fifty three percent well it's it's it's almost half but it's been you know it's somewhere in the fifties for sure so it it it understates it a little bit uh-huh why do people not vote um well it's the analysts usually say they don't think it will effect anything they're certainly wrong about that yeah um i think that that it's easy if you if if you think things are going bad enough to just turn off to the news and just not pay any attention It's the less you pay attention the less you know about what's going to effect you yeah yeah i i think i think apathy is is real big thing i mean just in the fact that you don't think you're going to have anything done i to me it's really hard to find um uh-huh any information on the candidates i mean i i voted yesterday and and uh uh-huh half half the people you know you really have to hunt to get information on them and you know as far as the local things go and if you know if you don't know them then yeah oh yeah that's right yeah and i i i agree uh i have made calls to various organizations the night before elections well one thing i do i usually do is go to the library and study for an election before it really yeah and and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things and that helps a little bit yeah that's a good idea they don't ask their they don't ask enough questions they ask on one or two issues and and many people can respond with platitudes yeah what you really need to do excuse me is find interest groups that that you know who's interest whose issues you are interested in and then find how the if they have done a candidate survey and lots of times they have and then you have something to base it on there was a back when i was living in Pittsburgh there was a group called the association for public justice i don't know if you've ever heard of them perhaps huh-uh huh-uh perhaps not i it's it's it they they really didn't you know it it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too uh-huh and they put out this this uh survey of candidates where they asked them like uh eight questions uh all the candidates for all the offices now it wasn't that great in that they didn't tailor the the question for you know for the particular office so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at the national level and vice versa yeah but uh other than that it was a very good way to to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that yeah i that's um i don't know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church that uh it it asked uh uh-huh it went all the way down well it went to some of our constables but mainly it was in the Dallas area not in the Plano area uh-huh but um it asked it had all sorts of questions about uh economics uh education and and uh uh family and things things things like abortion presumably yeah yeah but it had other things like um do you would you support um huh i know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was was would you support uh a a two thousand dollar uh tax credit for women that stay you know at home and and so it had kind of a variety of of um yeah right right of questions and it it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know support if they could support oppose oppose or or you know be undecided about it uh-huh i do do do you know what group did it yeah it was it was it was uh i thought it was really good but you know it course it doesn't go through all the candidates and some of them you know you think well this guy's this guy won't have any won't have any um uh-huh yup uh-huh say so about any of this anyway but it's kind of good to know their opinions anyway they you know run for a different kind of office once you're in politics you probably stay in politics i would think uh-huh that's right because yeah yeah i mean once they yeah that's right that's that's one point that was made that that you know uh i read one article saying even if you don't that abortion makes any difference at uh you know at a at a really local level like City Council or something like that these people will in the end they might get elected to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected these little to these to little offices yeah so you got to look at their views and and that was a point that i hadn't considered the reason i ask about the organization is i just got uh started working last year in an organization called Christian Coalition which does just what you were suggesting and i was wondering if it was uh-huh and that may have been who had done it i'm i don't remember um if it was theirs yeah i had like three or four different things i was looking at uh and that was that that was probably the most helpful i wish it had been more detailed i know that um uh-huh see the candidates don't like to respond to all these questions i you  so uh where where do you get your current events i'm i don't keep up on current events very well at all okay what i what i do on my i keep up on current events by as i walk by the newspaper stand if there is a headline that grabs my attention then i will stand there and look at it for a minute then walk into my office maybe once every six months i'll i'll find something that's interesting enough that i'll buy the paper and then usually i read end up reading a lot of it uh-huh um do you watch any television uh no oh yeah i do i watch i watch Star Trek and sometimes i watch the Equalizer i never watch the news oh uh-huh huh my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes i'll get get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and uh sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport i'll i'll be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and i'll read parts of it uh-huh uh-huh but uh i don't make any deliberate effort to keep up on current events i probably about one of the least informed people around how about you well um i used to read the whole paper every day wow and uh when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and you're like you want to talk to people about so what do you think about the situation in West Pakistan like this the parliamentary government's not going not you know not going to stay in there and people sort of stare at you uh but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day uh-huh um and i sort of glance at the front page uh i also used to listen to um public radio tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh uh-huh now i listen to the radio maybe five minutes in the morning and i don't get to listen evening some i'm pretty pretty uninformed uh but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio yeah we have a news station here that i listen to sometimes on the way to work but it's a short drive uh uh-huh yeah oh that was the other thing i used to drive to work i used to have a long commute and i would listen to every morning on uh uh-huh public radio there's a show called Morning Edition that lasts an hour and a half and um-hum they repeat the main headlines every half-hour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that i'm just walking and riding the bus um wow i i miss that uh the uh the well during the during the Gulf War we turned on the TV a couple times did you watch watch any more during that in the Gulf War yeah uh that i have to say that during the Gulf War yeah i watched a lot of CNN the whole Iraq thing uh-huh i really did uh because i was pretty interested in that and i have a a an Iranian roommate um-hum um-hum and uh so he had on constantly oh yeah i'll bet and uh so and actually i learned a lot from him about world situations and also i have a bunch of Persian friends because of him and so oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah yeah and they are always telling me about countries i have never heard of and political political situations that totally amaze me yeah yeah there's so much to know it is amazing and so um well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadn't really learned anything you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh like i i got more visual information but less less content real information in a way they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was was military clips and uh-huh yeah and it's almost as though that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it yeah well they have to show something you know they have to show something and that's all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate uh i think in part at least because they had to uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling i never thought about that the information per hour well technically the information on the TV is higher but the actual content is less right it's it's an interesting question about you know the bandwidth of the television  let's see mine's pretty easy actually uh i just got done reading a a magazine or a couple magazine articles about the uh new Saturns uh-huh um and although i can't afford it right now i would just like love to have one oh really you like uh so you're an American you want to buy American well no regardless of that fact it's the best car in the class for the best cheapest amount of money i'm interested in having it for uh doing a little auto cross racing uh closed circuit racing and uh it seems to just blow the competition competition competition away um in terms of handling uh acceleration handling power everything yeah it just got like the top rating it was compared up against uh let's see there was like the Mazda M X three uh Nissan's whatever their two N X two thousand the Civic S I and it just you know it it dominated over all of them everybody all the uh raters loved it i like the i like the styling and i seen a few of them actually race and they seem to be really good cars for it what about Mustang GTs Mustang GTs uh can't afford it those so you're talking about ones in a lower lower end price price range right yeah i'm a graduate student let's face it i don't make any money so right well you can wait till you graduate and you'll have plenty of money you can buy whatever you want yeah yeah we'll see then yeah right now i'm stuck i i've got a a Pontiac Sunbird Turbo that it's fast but unreliable and trying to get it prepared for racing but it's it would be nice just like scrap it and go for the go Saturn right would you use that for city driving and racing oh yeah i'd do it i'd use it for both the nice thing about auto crossing is you can you can do both auto crossing is what kind of track is that uh just like a um um set up a lot of times and it's like really large uh parking lots okay and you put up set up the track pylons okay and pylons and things tight turns hard acceleration i've seen a lot of Mustangs uh compete and it's interesting they get dominated by the Corvettes that are also in their class oh really yeah i would guess so yeah uh what are you thinking about buying uh i think i'd like to get uh BMW or if i go the German route which i'm kind of leaning towards right now but uh or maybe a Honda i mean a a Acura Legend the Legend uh a Lexus uh uh S C three hundred maybe uh-huh something on that order i haven't really determined if i like the the Japanese or the if i like them enough to purchase one yeah you know because your BMWs your German cars have good reputations i think yeah well i was i was actually in uh a lot of the BMW's are produced in uh uh Stuttgart and uh and Munich and i was i was there this uh summer yes i i was really impressed by the uh the uh factory uh tours and such for BMW the yeah they their they have the whole philosophy i mean they they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better which is kind of hard to take yeah uh i mean as you're walking through that little tour in uh Munich it's kind of they're trying to brainwash you too oh of course of course they are they want you to buy their car yeah there it was it was interesting i was at i i also went to uh the Porsche and uh it was it was amazing how they were completely opposed oh really yeah the uh yeah the uh the BMW is really oh like oh we have all these like high tech things and everything is put together with exacting tolerances and and then you go to Porsche and it's like well uh these cars are completely handmade and no two of them are alike um yeah that's and so it's like completely opposed i don't know which do i like better i think i like the Porsche's philosophy a little bit better although it's not really practical no it's not realistic unless it's it's a toy yeah if you can afford that kind of a toy then i guess so let's face it yeah yeah but it it BMW's good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for yeah just work short trips no mileage no heavy mileage i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year wow yeah so it's pretty minimal that's cool lasts a long time that's mainly what i'm looking for yeah that's good i also i was impressed by uh by the Mercedes too oh yeah i really i really like the Mercedes the factory was nice and but but if if you have a problem with a Mercedes you take it into a shop they're going to they're going to hit you up for just all kinds of things and is it different for the for the BMW uh i think well something on the order of a three series it's probably different once you get up in the five series and higher then probably all your repair costs go up significantly right i can imagine that so i'm kind yeah i'm not sure if i really want  think about uh taxes well i think they're a necessary evil uh i wish the government would operate on the same premise that uh businesses operate on and that is uh you spend what you have and you you don't spend more than you than you bring in yeah i think that the general idea is to spend you know spend uh during a time of recession that you know for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy but they're running under the assumption you know the way they're running it now they're have you know running it under a deficit spending you know while we're not under a recession so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running so that's kind of a basic thing of economics i guess keep spending keep going into debt you're not going to payoff what you owe so i guess the the question was more like uh do you get what you pay for you know get what you pay for well i it just depends uh uh roads are very expensive uh commodity and so is uh utilities they supply and police and fire department uh you know they need to make a living yeah and there's so i think for for for many years uh we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are uh to a great extent public servants uh-huh uh we have not paid them really what they're worth in what they contribute to society i agree with that but uh then again uh it's the hard to justify with all the wastefulness of money that the government spends on all levels of of uh government including municipalities as well as state and federal governments i guess i'm i'm a student right now and i don't make a whole lot of money and so i i kind of don't pay a proportionate amount of taxes to i guess uh compared to what i get because i you know all my my education is state sponsored i go to a state sponsored school and uh my education all up through high school and stuff so i guess i'm kind of in debt i i suppose because i don't you know been paying taxes all that all that long my parents i guess however however however have contributed to that you know for the education side of it and everything but uh i usually end up getting money back i will this year anyway from a uh you're very fortunate we just try not to pay any more in than we have to uh we pay in a substantial amount uh yeah i am i need it too otherwise things uh-huh we don't regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax uh-huh and progressive tax i think uh does not give people incentive to make more money and what i mean by that the more income you make the more tax you pay more taxes you pay it should be i think a flat percentage and uh that percentage ought to be an equitable amount uh-huh isn't uh last year when they passed the tax laws for the nineteen ninety ninety one whatever nineteen ninety one uh-huh uh i added up all the taxes that we were going to pay on all these different specific luxury items and travel expenses and everything else uh-huh i totaled them all up and basically uh we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax wow now that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every for every item on there uh-huh even though there's uh taxes on different things but you know there's federal there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying uh like when you buy a tire you pay a federal excise tax well isn't uh-huh there's a lot yeah lot of hidden taxes you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your your tank uh-huh the taxes that people don't think about that yeah the the the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay i guess but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes uh-huh there was that which candidates was it Jerry Brown one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all the the tax codes they have now and implementing a flat i think a flat percentage something like that yeah if you implemented implemented a flat percentage it would encourage people uh to make more money and the what people need to understand in my opinion now this is just my opinion okay uh is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes and so if they penalize businesses business people are smart enough to say here's my break point i'm not going to work any harder and make any more or create any more jobs uh-huh right exactly that's because until like eight and so based on that who do you think you're talking to you're talking to an employer up until like eighty five or something was the  so uh how you how do you find out what's going on what's new well uh quite a variety of ways i guess uh like to listen to the radio back and forth to work at least back to work and in the mornings uh-huh do you listen you listen to the same station or do you switch back and forth well i have one station i listen to when i get up in the house then i listen to another one in the car uh-huh i listen to i actually i listen to the radio most of all i don't i don't buy papers and stuff i i listen a lot to national public radio yeah which is i know pretty much it's got in the morning it has like an all news format and then uh toward it it changes like it goes onto classical then onto jazz later on but on in the way to work that that's what i do is i listen to to NPR and what it says about about what's going on hum well we don't have uh well let's see i guess it might be available i just haven't heard of it on that one i i guess i have come to think of it but uh um-hum i haven't made a practice of listening to that one uh-huh watching some TV in the evenings uh what it's it's funny i haven't seen do you watch like CNN or do you uh or the well i usually catch the networks and i will occasionally watch CNN too depends on what you know uh-huh Jack do you listen i don't know do i i like it when i watch TV i don't really watch TV news all that often but what i do is i i like ABC i think i think they have the best news network yeah uh i generally uh i don't know i go to the NBC sometimes have ABC sometimes have you ever watched Nightline with with with Ted Coppell or is that i i i get to see that i get that occasionally but it's like i i he's a i think he's sort of like an upscale Geraldo yeah i watch that you know he i digs he he digs just a digs just like a a a little a little too much i i wish i could actually stay up late enough to to see some of the to see some of those things yeah yeah yeah yeah you get Time Magazine or Newsweek or anything like that uh i don't take them i read them sometime i read them in the barber shop or whatever uh-huh dentist office material yeah i actually i i kind of gave up on on news magazines they they haven't they kind of pile end up piling up yeah that's what i was just about to say about the newspaper i uh i take it then i quit it yeah it gets there laying around and don't get to read it's does get to be quite a volume of oh well i tried like uh i like i read the Sunday paper you know i that one i can probably i can find time for you know like on a i i really like to on a Sunday morning get up and uh listen uh get up material after awhile yep and read the Sunday paper like first usually i try to read it from like from cover to cover you know yeah that same here and that that pretty much gives you gives me an idea what's going on and in about like a two hours it takes me to run right through it i can figure out exactly what what what's happened in like the past week but that's about the only newspaper that i really listen to our our morning paper throws you a curve they uh you know that's what i would like to do i say well i'd just like to take the Sunday paper well we'll uh we'll let you have the rest of the week for free so what do you what do you do so you end well you end up with like a big stack of papers anyway on the on the way out huh yeah but i say well the heck with it we'll go buy it from that guy on the street well one of the things that i i can't do is i just can't find the time to read the paper all that much it just if i were to if i were to it would take like what half hour a day oh yeah to to to find the time to read the paper and that's why i like the radio the best especially especially in the car because i when i'm in the car and i'm on my way to work there's nothing else i can do other than like watch the road you know yeah i've gotten into some uh you know we have a uh news service on our uh network here on the computer oh and it its it slides in a window across the bottom well we have that at at lunch in the cafeteria but we also have uh one that you pull up on your screen you know we have a computer network here at TI that you can go to uh um-hum so do you is it is it Dow Jones Dallas and get the national they have a Dow Jones segment there where it covers us uh you know some most active stocks uh general average yeah friends of mine at friends of mine at other at other uh at other locations they have they have that and it's like you can actually see like the ticker run you know you can open a window on your work station uh and you can run and you can run the uh the ticker across the bottom and it it actually you know they they run a ticker for for news items as well as stock yeah that's actual that DJNS i guess and so you can see you can see the uh you can  from the from the scale of one to ten i i lean more towards no restriction we by the constitution we have the the right to bear arms and i believe our freedoms are being constantly eroded all the time and President Bush just signed a law that that banned a lot of automatic weapons and and such where they wouldn't do any more damage than some Winchester rifles or things like that what do you think about that well i pretty much agree with you uh i wouldn't say that i'm a ten because i do think that there are some types of weapons that should be restricted because of their extreme potential to uh uh to produce collateral damage if you know what i mean i don't think that people should have nuclear weapons in their homes or or biological weapons but i'm probably uh on a scale of ten i'm a i'm a nine in that i think that any any arm that can easily be carried by hand should certainly be uh protected for individuals to own and uh to use uh in particular i'll express my opinion on this uh this there's there's some people that think that the second amendment is you know only a collective right that it applies to the militia i don't believe that i think it it applies to individuals uh also uh i don't think that the our founding fathers had anything in mind anything to do with hunting or even defense against criminals or or target shooting what they had in mind was that people need to be armed in order to protect themselves from the government becoming too strong and taking away our liberties well that's a that's a that's a good point also we have to we have to be cognizant cognizant that our society's becoming more and more haves and have nots and the main the main purpose say for the police is to keep the have nots from taking from the haves and that is the purposes of of the gun control well the thing with the police is that they're only good to pick up the pieces after the crime has happened we have to to take precautions to defend ourselves uh if someone comes after you with a gun there's no way that the police are going to stop them uh even if have an opportunity to call the police uh because someone has threatened you they won't come out and protect you all they can do is investigate a crime after it's been committed it's very rare that they prevent one so it's important that we each as individuals have the means to protect ourselves and in this day and age that means having guns oh i i i agree i my point was that the police want to get rid rid of the people of of guns and what's happening is that i see i i i view this country as as as we have peoples and societies and cultures and things that are be oppressed that are oppressed and so that to to take the way the those weapons so they can protect themselves is that's what the means and that's what they're trying to do and by enacting all this legislation i i agree with you i think that uh although to to a large degree what the the politicians are doing is just responding or reflecting what the electorate seems to be telling them the problem is of course is that the majority of the people in this country have no idea what the right to keep and bear arms means or what it's for and all they see is rampant crime in the streets and they think that banning guns is going to stop that but that's that's simply not the case uh you take away the guns uh from law-abiding people and uh i mean it it seems like a trite phrase but if if guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns they're not going to stop the drug dealers and the criminals from from getting uh guns of any sort and what they really need to do is attack the root causes of of crime that's true yeah well you know i another perspective is that the people in this country i'll just for not lack of a better word i'll say they're spoiled they haven't been except for the immigrants have come to this country they're not cognizant of war and and chaos and terrorism like Lebanon or countries that have been invaded and if our country needs if our country's invaded we need the people to to rise i mean the the military and the police isn't going to do it all for us and if and if we don't have the the goverment  recording so what kind of animals do you have well i have two cats uh i have two cats because i can't have dogs um where i live i i've wanted a dog i owned a dog we had dogs when i was growing up all the time uh-huh and um you know our our cats are are very interesting and we never owned cats when i was growing up so this is a uh it's been a really really neat uh neat kind of learning experience for me they've blown all my uh conceptions preconceptions about cats so do you do you have pets yeah i have a dog and a cat uh-oh do they get along so oh yeah they it was uh a very hairy two weeks there at the beginning uh the dog was a little under a year and the cat was about six weeks old and it it was a hefty break in uh-huh oh did the dog the dog like uh know that there was a cat and well it was very it was interesting because it it's just you know part of their makeup they're psyche i mean they just hate each other automatically but after a while they they got to be good friends and uh hum luckily it's sort of a big cat i mean it's about twelve pounds and uh so he can hold his own against the dog and uh but they they i basically got the cat to keep the dog company and uh they they do that yeah yeah that's that's actually why we got our second cat i we thought our cat needed a pet uh-huh uh you know you tend to personify these things but our our cat thinks our oldest cat thinks that it it should be a person and our youngest cat actually thinks it's a cat so it works out pretty well um yeah well i'll tell you one thing i found with with pets um i i think cats are easier to take care of especially when on a situation like you go off on a trip uh you know it's a real pain with a dog because you have to have someone come over and walk them and let them out and that kind of thing uh-huh yeah feed them and all that and sometimes i think wow if i had two cats i'd just you know get a feeder and uh yeah you know an interesting story is i i i have a friend who has um a cat that actually knows how to open Tender Vittles bags so if they go on a trip they just leave the bags on the kitchen floor and the cat'll go and open one when it wants to eat oh that's amazing i'm i swear to God it's like you know the i guess uh it earlier uh earlier time it would have to figure out how to use a can opener but you know now it it's pretty self sufficient i just think you they say you own a dog and you feed a cat and i think that that's pretty much pretty much true yeah that is interesting i hadn't ever heard anything like that but uh yeah i it blew me away yeah we've been uh we've been pretty lucky too the uh reason we first got the dog to begin with was i lived i'm in school still and i lived uh closer to campus um-hum and uh as usual the neighborhoods right near campus aren't that nice uh-huh uh-huh and uh so we got the dog as protection and i guess it worked because we were never broken into and the but the people on either side of us were so yeah uh oh really uh we we usually had rifle cleaning parties on the front porch when you know you move into a bad neighborhood you have your have all your friends over play the Grateful Dead and clean your rifles and they pretty much get the idea uh but the dog i guess would work too yeah yeah well it is a big dog uh she's uh around fifty pounds she's a a very very skinny shepherd oh okay uh well she's not pure and we we tried to figure out what she was crossed with we know the mother was a shepherd but uh she looks like she's crossed with like Greyhound because she is just thin as a rail and uh oh wow well see they they say that the uh mixed breeds have a better temperament anyway all that inbreeding that they do that they have to do to maintain a pure blood line i guess makes them really weird yeah definitely and they're also prone to more diseases and uh skin problems and my sister has a a pure bred gold uh yellow Lab and that dog has every problem you could imagine you know it's allergic to fleas it's uh got another skin condition and just the dreaded hip dysplasia yeah yeah yeah that's uh so we we haven't really had much problems with her she's uh just extremely hyper and uh i guess that accounts for her her physique and she runs like a gazelle so um-hum it's fun to take her to the park and watch her run rings around all the other dogs trying to play with them and they look at her like you're crazy you think i'm going to catch you she's maybe she is part Greyhound huh so yeah yeah either that's that's uh that's interesting i thought about for a while there uh there's a a movement now to uh adopt ex-race dogs and right  so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all yeah actually actually uh mine's real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on um-hum and uh that's usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because i get a couple thousand dollars back usually oh that's nice but uh actually i uh i don't really begrudge uh the uh the government their due i do i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know there's a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes right and i don't think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them to the people who really need them but uh um-hum generally i think they're pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didn't have taxation so right i don't have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i don't know if they're unfair they're confusing and i there seems to be less ability to get those all together yeah we actually we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county um-hum and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was um-hum and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for really and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization right uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadn't been made and all that kind of stuff and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of you just bought it right square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and just just showed that you know our obvious for some reason our property had been valued much higher right and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the appraisal really they didn't raise the they canceled your neighbors' taxes uh they didn't raise my neighbors' yeah they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal that's really great so i you you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh that's wonderful yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of mad at the world and uh he he had sort of that that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away right um-hum and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadn't been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff right that just didn't impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean right and you just bought yours that's the best argument i think yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty satisfying satisfying experience that's wonderful but it was it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like i bet um-hum oh it was a it was a it was like a judge's chambers that that you really wow it wasn't it wasn't the county council it was the it was the county but it wasn't the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i don't know i don't even know how they get on it you know i i'm just guessing they're appointed um-hum uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here so you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time it'd be him you um-hum right well he did he probably knows it really well the real estate market yeah so that was probably help but other than that uh i haven't had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh uh-huh uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships right and fortunately it was not taxable at that time right now it is but they actually they actually hassled me over it though right and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain oh you got audited wow yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and you know i just i said hey i mean it's tax free i mean that's my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually work i work with a guy now who's i I i guess he was right  okay well um i know some in some of the one of the smaller towns around Dallas they started curbside recycling um-hum and that's going really well uh because they i think what happened what what goes on is they get like discounts they get charged not by the amount of trash they do well they get charged by for the pick up of the trash and not for the recyclables oh so it's so you get pay you pay less to have your trash picked up because if you presort all out all your trash all your recyclables oh that sounds great what are they doing out there well it's sort of a mixed bag up here uh some of the communities have started off with volunteer recycling uh one of the towns near here Cambridge uh had a couple years worth of volunteer recycling i never saw it but i know a fellow who was involved in the effort who said that it was amazing just hundreds or you know maybe even more than a thousand cars coming in on the one recycling day a month and they had dozens of volunteers sorting things and when the volume reached a certain level the city's Department of Public Works finally decided to do a curbside program wow um-hum uh my town Arlington has had a uh a similar volunteer program and they just got the Department of Public Works to do a uh a daily drop off at their yard where you know people can bring in glass and and uh paper and and whatnot and aluminum and tin and some of the other towns around here fact just about all the towns that border Arlington where i live have gone to the curbside recycling and i really wish we'd do it here it's just so much easier for people and i think it's it probably results in a larger volume of stuff being recycled if all you have to do is put it out by your curb once a week right as it is here i sort of resent the effort to you know collect everything until i have a chance to get down to the DPW yard and drop it off you know it's not a huge inconvenience but it's just one more thing to do um-hum and it's hard to find i know at least here it's hard to find places that will that recycle and so many things are recyclable like shampoo bottles and water bottles um-hum but no place will take them and you know i mean they're real specific you know you can do your newspapers but you have to take all the slick stuff out you know and well what do you do with the slick stuff yeah i mean they're so specific i mean in i know in Dallas they're having a real hard time right now because the drop off sites uh-huh people aren't there's a you know what they say that a couple people can mess it up for everybody right and there's some people that are not sorting out uh like their slick stuff out of their newspapers and uh all their plastic bottles or their brown glass out of their clear glass and the companies that recycle the stuff won't recycle it then oh boy and they'll just trash it so that all the effort goes downhill boy that's a real problem that really hate to hear that just regarding the newspapers the one curbside thing we do have in my town actually is every other week they'll pick up newspapers which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great really yeah that is great gee i i didn't i i just thought there was something in the slick stuff that that made it so they couldn't recycle it well that's great yeah i i guess it depends on the facility it's going to the thing that i guess the flip side of that and in our town anyway is that they won't pick up plastics now and even when they were here and in other towns around here they won't take the so called injection molded things which i guess basically are containers that are bigger at the top than at the bottom like yogurt containers typically oh okay um-hum and uh you know i don't know about Dallas but i think people around Boston eat a lot of yogurt so there's just a lot of lot of containers that uh that wind up getting tossed you know without being recycled yeah um and i don't know what's going on with in terms of capacity it's my impression although i haven't really read anything about it that so many towns and cities have started recycling with there might not be enough firms out there that are willing to take the uh or you know that'll pay decent money to take the materials right right i know well i know here at uh i i'm in i'm in college and um uh-huh we have more than one campus and i'm on the kind of like an off branch campus um-hum and on the main campus they've got a company that comes in and takes out all the recyclables all the copy paper and all the cardboard boxes i mean everything that's recyclable oh that's great  to uh trial by jury and whether it works or not is hey i like the current system yeah i expect it's um about as good as one can expect um i suppose you get an illogical verdict now and then but uh yeah yeah i figure the answer to that is to educate the consumers or the uh the the jurors you mean the people right just yeah i just got called to my first jury duty uh-huh i never been on a jury how about you hey two weeks ago first time i was ever called and were you did you did you show up and do it or whatever it was oh yeah i showed up but uh the case settled before they could uh make us uh actually listen to anything so i have no idea what the case was about or uh you know i didn't get to do anything my brother was on some real complex business case where they were um decide to asked to decide the exact amount to the penny of fraud in some credit card case you know wait so the jury had to like go over ledgers and financial records and well they went over it in the trial but they didn't give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh wait a second don't don't they have to enter that in as evidence and can't the jury request any piece of it yeah but they have to ask for it and then the the bailiff brings it and they can look at it then the bailiff takes it away again it's not like they can just spread it out in their jury room and then you know get out a bunch of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up it was right the the jurors request an IBM three seventy yeah right would you give me an IDMS IDMS system or something like that dear judge you know it was it was a very peculiar case i guess that one was didn't work very well um uh but whoa that i'm not sure that's the jury's fault no no i don't think so either um but i don't know what else they could've done yeah yeah um i guess i guess nothing else but uh TI suggests just giving it to the judge but uh well for sentencing i don't know does that make any sense i mean it depends on what i i don't know what the offense is i guess that's why we have juries is to take each case on a case by case basis and that's fine anyway um no i mean the jury there's problems with it as far as finding jurors as far as weird verdicts as far as just the timing the timing you know it takes a lot of time but uh you know i like it because i think you don't have the abuse or it's a sort of a check if you have one guy doing something he can sort of go out of control and it's a long time before he gets reigned in yeah or if it's an organizational problem you know where where you know the and he can do a lot of damage you know it's possible to imagine a corrupt judicial system where you know all the judges are are part of the system i guess that happened in Chicago once huh yeah yeah or just even one guy just before you get a chance to uh you know to uh purge him he could do a lot of damage yeah yeah i guess they do anyway i guess the only trouble with the jury system i see is it's really darned darned expensive and and you know time consuming and you know and and all these systems of where you can like ask a jury ask each juror what they think about something then kick them out and you know i guess they can manipulate it a little you know maybe some of the uh like the hype needs to be cut out but you mention expense yeah i think you get what you pay for yeah it's true no lie you know if you want a cheap legal system you're you're gonna get that kind of Kmart service or uh well Kmart's not all that bad there's got to be some sort of cheap what's the epitome of cheap these days beats me um yeah in in Massachusetts it's the judicial system their buildings are all falling down well i guess that gets them the sample good night sir all right good luck take it easy  okay so well do you live in a high crime area oh it's uh yes and it's the crime mostly in this area is uh burglary house break-ins in fact our car our son's uh car was broken into about uh-huh two weekends ago three weekends ago they stole a stereo i mean it was parked out in front of our house it happened overnight but there's a uh oh we we had a break at our place our house about three years ago bought an alarm system about within five days after that do you think that that will do it oh i don't think anything is going to be uh foolproof i think it's it's a deterrent i think if they have a choice between our place and one house that's not protected they'll go to the other place they'll go to the yeah but uh it's uh we live in uh well i live in Richardson actually you say Arlington do you mean Arlington Texas huh okay yeah Arlington Texas yeah yeah and uh the crime out here is mostly of the break in type and vandalism and sort of stuff like that i don't think there uh-huh you don't have much street crime no no as far as uh muggings and murders and stuff like that no that's pretty isolated pretty rare i think would knock on wood right um that's what i would think in that area yeah so what do you think you can do to uh yeah but oh you know i think a lot of the crime is committed committed by people that are trying to uh finance their next fix and uh uh-huh it's you know that goes back to a drug problem and uh nobody's been able to solve that yet i think it's uh right drug related and then a lot of it starts in the homes and uh the the uh breakup of breakup of the family unit's caused a lot of the problems i mean the dad is gone for one reason or another the mother's raising the kids right family unit you mean uh-huh they just get there's no discipline at the at the home so it just goes from bad to worse it just starts there and leads leads from that into the drug situation and then as i said they're trying to finance their next uh uh-huh fix next fix so they're desperate uh yeah yeah and that's what the uh seems like the uh genre of the crime these days is a lot of desperate people whereas i think probably fifty years ago the crime wasn't quite so intense that way um-hum right yeah probably wasn't as personal as it is today i mean break with the uh muggings and the break-ins of the houses and so forth then there there just wasn't as much of it i i imagine as as there is now yeah with the uh-huh well i mean i think the reasons were different back then more than they are now like you're saying the drugs can make people really desperate so that makes them also very dangerous yeah yeah yeah well i think the courts are to blame i i i just think they're they're overly lenient on these people and i was watching Larry King Live there and they were they were talking about rape and castration and so forth and uh uh-huh uh-huh there's always so much concern about the uh the rapist and the the burglar and so forth and no concern at all about the victim yeah yeah that's really disgusting yeah so uh it i think the whole thing just needs a complete overhaul but it starts in the family but it's everybody's to blame i think at least a lot of probably a lot of apathy on the part of people that haven't been uh victimized yeah uh-huh right uh-huh oh yeah because they have no idea what it's like right so uh it it it's just a big problem and uh yeah um-hum there's so many other problems to go around and economy's a problem and i guess at one time Russia was a problem and uh every there there's always one problem or another seems to be uh ahead of the crime problem but uh uh-huh right that's probably that has to be one of the top two or three well i think for the US i think basically from what i've read that the US has one of the highest crime rates in the world so i think that's a priority um-hum yeah you know i think we think we're real sophisticated we're really not when you come right down to it there used to be a lot of stuff on the highways and the roads when you're driving around dropped by people that are we're not huh that you makes makes you wonder whether they're not just jerks or not i mean they just do crazy thing they they're not breaking the law but they just do some crazy things and right yeah oh i don't know it's it's kind of disgusting but they we're really not all that sophisticated over here no if you come down to it if you look at uh the statistics on child abuse um-hum and uh violence against women and uh the drug wars and uh also um um let's see i think with like with rape it's one out of three women and one out of ten men or boys rape the the amount of rape and uh what's that yeah um-hum uh like with the drugs i think that one solution that i know i hate to say it but is legalization uh-huh because that's where all the drug the gangs get their power over the drugs because it's illegal uh-huh right and uh i there's a lot of complications that go along with saying that but i just nothing else seems to be working yeah yeah i was going to say it's worth a  you want to start or should i start uh yeah you go ahead okay let's see uh i think that uh i i think that trials by jury are a good idea i just think the concept of multiple attempts uh at trial is when uh with when they're always saying oh well uh uh i want to appeal i want to appeal i want to appeal i i think multiple appeal is what our real problem is it's not the not the the twelve man jury trials uh think that that i i would not be totally adverse to the concept of of uh of uh i guess uh uh judge trials either uh i think our our we have a real big problem with litigation we we spend too much of our time litigation in our legal system and oh yeah it's it's just incredibly incredibly complex uh uh i i don't have any problem with the idea of having the jurors although it is a bit disappointing to see the attorneys manipulate the process by uh raising so many objections to jurors so that they can try and get for their client um a jury slanted one way or the other i mean you can sit there and dismiss people for for trivial reasons and and that takes up a good deal of time too um the the thing i find sort of disappointing about uh a lot of this is that um-hum often a judge uh and and you hope you get one that's that's really rational and and looks at uh each case separately you'd like to be able to give them some flexibility to be able to sentence uh if it's a really awful crime to really put the person away for a long time uh or if there's a lot of intent there and it's obvious put them away on the other hand you know maybe to to change the sentencing slightly uh that you'd like be able to see them give a different kind of punishment uh not necessary community service that's getting a little bit overworked but but but rather some of other sort of of restitution rather than simply putting them away behind bars um-hum uh trial well one thing is we do not have a trial by peers anymore uh that's that that is gone gone gone out gone out the door for one thing the very first thing a lawyer attempts to do is get an ignorant jury as part of in fact as part of the process they're not supposed to know anything whatsoever about the trial oh yeah so particular so particularly for famous trials what that indicates is that the only people who are really at that jury are idiots people that have been on the moon right only ignorant people and that means low IQ generally wherein that's not that's not trial by jury now i guess that's that that's become less so i've noted that um uh the last couple times that i've had to go by jury they've actually selected intelligent jurors now i i i'm not so sure that would be true if it were a trial of uh of uh some notorious notoriety notoriety notoriety uh but in the case of the normal trials it's much much harder than it used to be to than to get out of it so they do try not to let uh excuses get you out of uh trials now oh yes my my you can delay it but you can't get out oh that's that and and that's actually pretty good my my mother recently uh uh had jury duty uh down in in Texas and uh um-hum the the judge would not hear any excuses i mean from anybody uh he didn't care if they had doctor's appointments or anything he said you're you're here in the pool and you're going to serve but when it came time for and and it turned out it was a rape trial um-hum uh and the uh uh the attorney asked my mother well uh how do you feel about this and she told him quite frankly that she thought that the punishment should be extremely severe for rapist and then um-hum the guy began to ask um what does your husband do for a living well he's retired Air Force ah was he retired law enforcement Air Force they they dismissed her on the grounds that they didn't want her that her husband could have been seen as being in law enforcement even though he was a programmer in the Air Force they wanted to stay away from anybody that might even have a smidgen of law enforcement so even though she was there to do her duty to serve um-hum she was dismissed on the grounds that she might possibly remotely have some prejudice and that's my mother's fairly well read she didn't actually know about this local case it was of rather small import uh but i would agree with you that that not necessarily does somebody have to be ignorant not to know but they'd have to have met um-hum  do you have any yes we do have a pet we have a a dog that we got from the uh well we call it the S P C A it's the uh animal from an animal shelter uh he'd come in there as a stray uh he's a Pomeranian and Sheltie cross uh uh-huh all right yeah well he was very well trained when we got him uh he's oh that's good you don't often find that i don't think no uh we suspect that he was hurt in an accident you know got away from somebody traveling through and hurt in an accident because right a dog that looks as good as he does and is trained as well is someone that has lost him and not have been able to locate him uh-huh and uh if they were local people they would have been able to find him sure there's a okay uh that's interesting yeah the only pet that i've had uh i'm a i'm a doctoral student right now uh-huh and in my in my earlier days as a student i kind of time shared on a dog with a a good friend of mine and uh it was an amazing dog it really was they had he had gotten it from the pound and uh it it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino oh yeah kind of looks like a Dalmatian a Dalmatian and we trained it from a pup and basically it right now it it's fully trained and it can do uh-huh a lot of things it will get beer for you out of the fridge and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff so it's really it's it's kind of a show piece anymore and whenever anybody comes over we all have to show him Domino you know oh i think so yeah it's uh she's been a real good a real good dog and uh just it's kind of a shame that i'm i'm gone i'm away from it now i i just i actually live in Florida uh-huh but i'm on an internship up here for a year and then i go back down but uh yeah Domino's a real good dog uh yeah what uh possessed you to get the dog well i i guess in one sense we felt that it it's nice to have a dog even though there are you know complications come with it and then with our children uh at the time they were oh grade five and and grade eight so yeah uh-huh it was an age where it was uh we thought it was be good for them to have the discipline that goes with with having a pet uh sure sure learn a bit learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that that's good that kind of builds some character a little bit yeah right uh well that's the idea i think the reality of it is that they perhaps uh it depends on the on everyone's discipline um-hum and uh from that aspect i'm short on the discipline because i don't uh enforce that the kids look after the dog and uh we've had him about four years now uh-huh uh but i think it does it it you know it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly uh yeah that's something that's important for sure yeah i think uh do you live in a in a in a fairly rural part of the uh or uh actually no we live in a in an area that's oh probably about two and a half miles from the university oh i see uh we live right might say we live right in uh in the middle of a residential area um and uh so that is not as good uh you know this dog being a small dog it's uh more you more acceptable but again yeah yeah it's not that big of a problem With Domino she was full grown i would estimate seventy pounds yeah and you know we we lived in Oviedo which is a small town it's a suburb of Orlando uh-huh but there's not there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around and she was a dog that loved to run so that was the biggest problem i saw and i think that's one of the uh the issues people need to think about before they get a dog is you know do you have the room for this dog to run around or can you know i guess you can't really say for cats me and cats don't get along too well uh but you know that whole space issue i think is real important yeah it's uh that's one of the biggest concerns it's like uh there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal but the same time one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of of the animal right yeah that that and the larger they are the more room they need to exercise sure and that's all part of your of keeping your part of the relationship you know showing the maturity and responsibility to recognize those uh those issues right well you know and also the whole whole thing with noise my mother oh she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs that don't train them uh-huh and you know we had we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had uh Brittany Spaniels and they're very high strung animals to begin with but uh  Wendy i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets if uh if that may be the case and any kind of long term financial planning or anything like that uh right let me ask you the question do you have a uh budget or a monthly budget or a long term budget that you stick to right now i'm in college and i'm on work study and so my budget comes from my dad's help um-hum uh-huh he helps me out a lot and i get paid monthly so that's kind of hard to have a budget my mother uh doesn't get paid much money so her budget is um just uh planning for IRAs i see i see well good i'm i'm kind of in a different situation but i i i went through that too when i was in school but uh i was i was working to get through college and and uh trying to make it through that but uh i'm married and have uh a couple of children and we have to uh pretty much stick to a budget i'm on a salary so i don't get any overtime or anything like that so uh-huh oh but we have a fixed income and we have to make sure that uh every dollar we have is is spent accordingly and um what we try and do to to stick to our monthly budget is we pretty much have you know the house payment we have the insurance premiums uh-huh um utilities and so forth and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside and we also try and set aside money for savings set aside money for the college the kids' education college education the future and uh um-hum set aside money for bonds and and we also set aside an emergency fund because that sounds good we've uh we've been married for about ten years and we find out that you know no matter what kind of budget you stick on there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something happen with the house that you have to have money for and uh right it's not enough to go in to take a loan out but uh you have to have money for right and uh then we have you know whatever's left over is disposable income disposable disposable yeah discretionary income that we use for the rest of the month so and it's worked out very well it's uh it's helped us so that we haven't been you know too long on the month and too short on the money and uh try and stick with that and nice thing about it i uh my wife is well that's good is excellent in that we both work together we both have a budget and we stick to it and there's no surprises in that well good with two kids that could be hard well actually i have four kids four so yeah i said a couple of kids i i guess i should have specified i have four oh my goodness four little boys yeah four boys oh my goodness it's just me and my sister you bet you bet all right and my parents divorced three years ago and my sister had gotten through college but i was still in high school and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together um-hum yes and then uh before the divorce she had saved for my college uh-huh but uh when we had the divorce she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house oh so now my dad's paying for all of my college and financial aid and scholarships i'm a music major so i have auditions coming up well good good uh-huh yes well what year are you in college i'm a sophomore you're a sophomore so you have a few more years right right i'll i'll probably have about two two and a half years left uh-huh well good for you good for you yeah i imagine it uh is a little difficult to stick with a budget during uh during school and so forth oh it sure is i i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks and i and i don't spend over that yes well great great and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on too oh sure there's there's always music books to buy lab fees oh yes oh yes well you're not a starving artist yet are you oh no no no i don't plan on being a starving artist that's why i'm in college good well good there there's enough of those in the world huh right good good i'm glad to hear that Wendy well that's usually because they're not real educated they can't afford to have a really good job who's who's not very well educated the starving ones there's enough out there that if you have if you're educated enough then you can make money oh yes yes that's true that's true i've found that out so that's why i'm planning and and preparing for the uh education of my children also try and set that money aside right what did you major in i majored in business administration well good you know plenty about planning a budget a budget and um yeah but uh once again  right okay yes how many kids do you have i think we i think we're going to talk about parents spending time with their children we have three children who are eleven nine and eight right so this is a big issue with us although i don't recall marking it on my little things to talk about but perhaps they are looking for uh words to be said like day care and quality time and uh-huh anyway you don't have children no but you're married yeah we we been married for two and a half years we've been trying for about two years but no luck yet hopefully oh you know i know we're not supposed to do this long distance but actually i'm getting a call i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting could i ask you to hold one minute i'll be right back excuse me just a moment they're gonna get mad uh-huh had she has three kids eleven nine and eight hello i'm so sorry that was my daughter's Brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow Brownie meeting uh-huh it's all right okay so it keeps you busy do you have a lot of activities with your kids well i don't wanna i don't want this to be a unilateral conversation but yes we do both my husband and i work and our children are sixth fourth and third grade and the school years are wonderful they're just wonderful the kids they're real people and they're interesting and they they have all their own activities and um uh-huh i think as parents we really enjoy them and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel i'm sure i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids uh-huh so they're pretty good kids huh yeah well we had nine well growing up i guess i can talk about us uh we had nine kids in our family we had eight boys and one girl but my dad um yeah and the time that my we spent with our dad was he owned his own business so we worked with him most of the time you had eight boys and one girl so that's how we spent most of the time with him yeah are you Mormons because with Utah and the large family that was the dead giveaway huh well we're Catholics i came from a family of five i had four brothers the only girl uh-huh oh and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled i never felt spoiled in fact i always felt my toys were destroyed which that i was gonna say my sister wasn't spoiled very much no usually busy fighting for survival yeah that's exactly what it was well i do think with working parents it is i mean there are some real issues here um but uh-huh that i think um i don't know it's an interesting phenomena i happen to um i'm a pediatrician my husband is a physician so um oh i i teasingly i talk to parents about this a lot uh children i i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home um need very early to come to grips with any guilt that they feel and decide what's best for them and their family yeah uh-huh and i feel when my children were very young i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home i really believe that um-hum and it has um helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age and i think our kids are real secure um-hum and have a real sense of priorities and that they can do anything and be anything both male and female a lot so i know it sounds like a rationalization but it's i really think it's true for our family and i think it has worked very well well yeah it's like you said it's you know to each his own i mean we're planning on having my wife stay home and but there's no question i think that's really the best if if a woman is happy doing that i hate to put it quite that way um-hum yeah i was twenty nine when i had my first child and um i would not have been real fulfilled i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child it's a wonderful it's wonderful to be a mother but um-hum um i liked i like the way i did it i sort of worked half time i had very flexible hours right i nursed all three of our children till they were at least a year and i you can do that despite working very easily which is one of the things i preach all the time to to mothers oh uh-huh um and i think we choose very very carefully the um alternative situations that we had them in um-hum some babysitting groups again i know it sounds like a rationalization but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children and they they learn to share and they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they're secure i think that helps um-hum well that's good sounds like you're have a handle on it oh yeah hope so so your wife does she work right now um no not right now right right well we just moved down here we used to live up in Seattle she's out for for a couple years so you're still trying to dry out it's it's no problem here yeah we really liked it up there but then when  do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore that's a good question uh there would be a point there was a point where i would have said know that no one would deserve to die for for a crime that he committed but uh since i've become a parent and since i've seen uh things like Jeffrey Dahlmer i really have to question that i really uh i i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people um-hum and uh try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment uh of the statements made by people against the the death penalty um i I like the statement made by uh Cuomo Cuomo i I believe is um he's he's governor of New York but uh he's against the death penalty but um he said that he would he would want to to seriously hurt or if not kill someone if if they did something to his wife and that's but but even even in that circumstance in that uh uh situation he would be he would hope that there would be people around him who would uh keep him from doing the doing those things oh it's a uh it's a question of your your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response right exactly uh and and that was the thing that uh killed Dukakis back uh four years ago when someone asked him a similar question and he he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when uh people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion um-hum a a gut level reaction and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level uh you know whether it be a biblical force uh you know the eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth a life for a knife life type logic or just uh uh some sort of anger at putting people putting uh murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life uh while we foot the bill yeah i think people are are working at that from more of a uh a gut reaction than a a reasoned humane one see i don't think a decision's ever gonna be made on death on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do are they reformatories where we're trying to take people who can't survive or or that that aren't conforming enough to society so that that we work well together or are they is it a penal institution is it designed is it designed for punishment um the death penalty surely fits in well with uh in a penal situation where you're trying to punish um perhaps not in the manner that we do it but but it it in in theory it fits in in reformatory system in a reformatory i mean if you if you put someone to death you you obviously can't reform them that's true yeah uh the the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and i really don't uh agree with that i don't think anyone who would commit a uh a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say well i was about to kill and dismember this person but ooh if they catch me they're going to kill me so i better not do it i i just don't think that uh that it works that way yeah i don't think it's done i don't think we run it as a deterrent i mean people say that but i mean if it was really a deterrent i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west you know they saw other horse thieves hanging by their necks every once in a while and um-hum if we really want if it was really seriously gonna be a deterrent deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever nobody ever sees it if someone ever if you know like say some young kids or something like that that that might be inclined more towards the life of crime had to sit and watch and and see a guy burn or or you know something or shot by firing squad or something like that i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than you know telling them that there's there's protestors out here at the you know well i I don't know if that would really work that way or not uh there's a lot of violence  oh well anyway i uh i uh oh i i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way um i'm Ann oh you're Ann hi but um anyway i uh lot of lot of stuff interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if we're going to talking about the subject tonight tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the criminal courts yes yeah the the one of which was uh something something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh yeah yeah well the the uh the the people that oh really the the the uh the jury that's trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that fact right how is it i can't i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here oh um it's in Ventura and there's there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously and it's kind of it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that well that videotape was just horrible yeah it was everywhere yeah so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on oh i agree with you but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff exactly you know um the you know i i'm kind of torn on this issue it's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true but on the other hand is it's also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict right uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough exactly based on fact right how interesting ooh so what's the prevailing thought within the community i um i mean you know what the news media's gonna make of it but what about the community they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i haven't talked to uh i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine there's there's some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic oh here we go again folks kind of stuff uh-huh oh my goodness that can't be good for Los Angeles either no no i you know on on on one hand you on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because it's they they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy oh exactly um unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to uh a big city like Los Angeles you're going to have it just about anywhere um-hum there but that's that's interesting well yeah um what about the judge who's hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a good a good adjudicator i don't know you know and and again there's something else that you know there was a uh it something else along those lines there was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins i don't know if this this got this got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem um girl walked into a Korean owned store and uh they she had a dispute black girl uh-huh she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her oh really yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was oh my goodness it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh there's uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge to get that judge recalled i would think yeah yeah hm that's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized standardized sentences yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing um-hum and then it's a matter of of deciding guilt  okay well um i used to work in a day care center i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and it is uh-huh they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very well-known center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers hm um-hum all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left yeah so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when they're not expecting it because they do do things differently when you're not around so well that i know what the things that we kind of looked at is is you wanna see how many teachers you have um-hum and and how many kids they have and how they break it up right because we had we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in um-hum it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them and then you know so we got our uh day care free um-hum but they didn't have enough teachers well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room and uh-huh um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool um-hum the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left um-hum um they one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them up hm and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem yeah so um did did they separate them by age group yes because i'd think you know i think that's one thing that was important right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didn't walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds uh-huh upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that yeah you know they really did separate them well it was just the teachers themselves it it sound yeah it sounds like to me your your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people right but yeah that they're not affectionate people that they're they're kind of parents maybe parents themselves or something yeah their system right but their but their system was was great but um the uh you know the caring just wasn't there the one woman that taught that did the babies um-hum i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and um-hum um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know yeah i i i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and PhD's and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff but if they don't reach out and touch the kids then that doesn't do any good yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day yeah and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care they're just there yeah you know going through this routine which is lousy and the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but um-hum uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and um-hum uh-huh and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it and yeah you don't see that much yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did that's cute they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um you know obedience obedience was important yeah that has to be with a day care center and you know so they used you know they used uh oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself i've never heard of that that's that's a new one on me and it's it's it's one uh i can't remember what they call it exactly but you you just stand them in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around uh-huh and they have to stand there  what do you feel about the um present situation in the Mideast well it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is um-hum what do you think Mark yeah i'd agree i think i think there's definitely been some changes um and i think you know the the um end of the Soviet Union will definitely have it's effect on on the situation oh yeah um you know in that there's there's not you know there you know if you know it's basically since the end of World War II there was always you know that little proxy war going on um-hum you know with um the US funding Israel and you had the um Soviet Union funding the Arab countries and then we'll see what happens when uh they're not funded quite as much or supplied with arms the same way yeah um-hum yeah but on the same token you know Israel has lost a lot of their you know value to the US in being you know the foothold of capitalism um-hum you know in in the Mideast well i we tend to be pretty strong supporters of Israel ourselves you know we support kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet um-hum um-hum overall tend to support them but i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was you know during the war uh in uh Kuwait was uh um-hum the fact that they did not retaliate for the uh Scud missiles that were um-hum uh launched there that just seemed to me to be a uh a phenomenal uh demonstration of restraint and it must have reflected uh uh some awful good uh diplomacy on the part of the US um-hum yeah but on the other hand you know if they would've had a hard time retaliating because they you know they they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes i see they basically would've you know had a had a fly they'd had they would've had had to fly through you know two enemies uh you don't think they've got the codes from the US already the US had claimed that they would have not given them to them i see i mean of course you know public statements can be taken for that's true they can can't they um-hum yeah well what do you what about this situation with uh you know the uh do you continual uh harassment by Iraq right now and uh apparently failing to let the in uh arms inspectors have free access um-hum you know it well to begin with you know i pretty much question our what what the US's motives were in uh in in actually the original involvement um-hum um i the cynical side of me says that you know who it was more for uh um the the domestic political situation than for anything else hm yeah okay you know and that you know and for portraying Bush as a strong president sure um i mean i really i really think that that my gut feeling is that that that you know he pretty much picked picked a fight with um with um Hussein i mean i'm not not saying at all that Hussein wasn't quite willing to get enter that fight um right but i i think i think that that um we chose to have our official feelings hurt um-hum well do you think that uh we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and uh we're a lot you know move on into Kuwait and see what happened i think i mean i thought i think that um in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen um-hum and i i really don't i really don't think that i think i think it was it was there were there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests right um yeah well may have been you know i'm not saying that that's not the case uh yeah and i mean in in in along those line since it since you know it really it really didn't accomplish very much except we're getting getting uh the Iraqis out of Kuwait right i just don't i just don't i i i don't i i i don't foresee Bush making the decision to invest a lot of manpower and money and you know in in fighting a second battle no um you know over over the um over over what what what probably won't accomplish him accomplish much for him politically no it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do to do much more in there um-hum even at this point yeah well what about uh do you have any any views on uh Israel's relation to the US do you think we ought to you know back off on our support of the country or what do you well i have i have very mixed feelings about Israel um i think that that for a long while we've we've had almost a you know had had this  um what's our topic taxes do we pay too much taxes right um well do we what do you do um i guess that i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in my tax bracket is is pretty high up there i pay the i generally pay the maximum tax bracket and uh i think that we're paying too much because i don't have any children uh-huh right and i pay a lot on property taxes um sure i don't have any um i don't you know i don't use an awful lot of city services it it you know it's like i have to work um-hum but uh i have to work all the time just to make enough money to pay the taxes um-hum right and um you there's so many people who wanted a dib of the federal money um-hum or the state money or whatever it is and i just sometimes many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes right how about you do you pay too much uh well no i can't really complain i'm a student um and i i work as a co-op at uh Georgia Tech Research Institute and uh i'm gonna get back most of what i earned i mean most of what i pay in taxes and uh and uh one one of my parents is still claiming me hm well when you when you go out into the uh when you go out into the working world it it it changes quickly um you look at your paycheck and you go oh my gosh where did it all go um-hum i'm sure um what kind of what kind of uh well have you paid a lot of in taxes have you been out working and then gone back to school or are you did you go directly from high school into into college i went uh well i did work um just various jobs for some time but i i didn't make enough money to really make too much of a difference right to worry about it have you have you been active in in politics trying to concerning this have you like worked on a political action committees or something like that no no i haven't i uh i haven't done any of that type of work myself um um-hum but every once in a while when i hear up here at at um in DC area um one of the radio stations has been talking about the the Congress um Congress has added too towards a Members Bank there you know there's a bank that they all bank with and i guess it went defunct recently um-hum and one of the Congressmen has has written in the last three years almost about a thousand bad checks hm and we we the taxpayers float him a loan for all those all those bad checks no interest no repayment schedule really really and um it's causing quite a stir up here because we're so close to DC anyway it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur um-hum oh sure um i i i think we pay too much and i've i look at my paycheck and i make well let's see they take out in state and federal taxes i think i pay forty two percent wow forty two cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government and then they charge me sales tax and they charge me gasoline taxes and they charge me all these others and it's just too expensive i can't believe that um-hum taxes um-hum i i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for hm you know what i mean yeah do you have you used um student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government no no i haven't uh i uh my father pays for my my schooling my tuition so uh i'm i haven't made use of that what are you studying down there physics physics ooh that sounds like a fun fun field everybody says that scientific heavy science are you like in the particle particle research or um anything like that or is it more um applied physics um i haven't i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet actually um the the degree i'm getting is physics there's a different one for applied physics so i guess you could call it more straight stuff okay well maybe maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's rolling towards whatever it's rolling toward than applied i doubt about that are are is America i mean are we pretty pretty steep compared to most countries actually i don't think we are nah i don't think so either um like like Europe um-hum um England um-hum i know the taxes are a lot higher um-hum but they do have socialized medicine and things like that yeah and um i know that i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that um they're talking or maybe it was on the radio  so uh do you keep a monthly budget or anything like that oh yeah yeah i i'm one of those people who keep a record of everything oh so you you keep record of all the checks you write and all the credit card yeah and all the A T M transactions and everything and i've got a file for each of them and uh-huh how do you categorize these things that's what always sort of stumped me when i sat down to do it right huh i i have a file box and each file has a little piece of paper on it and each file there i have a file for each month of the year okay and then i also have files for like credit card receipts and when the bills come in for the credit cards they go in the month that they have to be paid for okay um so this insures that you know what your bills are and that they get paid right unless i get paid on time like like for instance if a bill is due on March fourth i'll just i'll put it in the folder with March and that way when i get paid in March i know that whatever bill is in there have to be paid in that month uh-huh uh-huh okay so that insures that the bills get paid before other things get paid for now do you uh-huh go ahead right and that and that way i keep a running list of what bills i do have and that way i know if i have any extra money or not uh-huh okay and uh what happens then when you don't when i don't what have extra money then i don't do anything i've got two little boys oh okay oh uh-huh so i'm at home most of the time anyways but like once in a while like when my taxes came back i had extra money so i paid a babysitter to watch my kids for the day and i went to i went to goofing off and you know just something little like that but it's something that you really got to keep an eye on when you have kids uh-huh uh-huh because you're always got to have money when you have kids oh yeah so do you do anything about you know saying hey i'm willing to spend this much a month on food and this much a month on well i have a i have a running budget for every month clothing or uh-huh and on that budget i type up a budget for every month in the year and it has the bills that i know i have every month electric phone food the kid's pediatrician uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh uh my Visa bill you you know all the bills i know i have every month are on that budget uh-huh and so once all of those get paid i go through my file and see if there is anything else and if there's not then i know that money the rest of the money is mine so is food in that list also and so you have a certain amount you spend on oh yes groceries that you expect to spend for each month right right okay and things like um now some some expenses come up you know twice a year or once a year like insurance right or well that comes up every six months for me or like tags come up once a year and you've got to figure that in too uh-huh uh-huh so you have an entry for each month for those things right whenever my tags come up uh there is an entry right there that says tags and then i just leave the space blank until i find out how much i owe for my tags and then i get them and that way i know i know that they have to be paid in that month so i'm expecting it uh-huh uh-huh and and so you i mean each month before that do you put away you know one tenth one twelfth of it or no usually i just pay it out of whatever paycheck uh is in that month because after i pay my regular bills i usually have approximately a hundred and fifty dollars and with that hundred and fifty dollars i pay things that come up like insurance uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh or tags or whatever happens to come up in that month uh-huh i could pay with that hundred and fifty dollars and then what's left i can do what what i want with uh-huh so now what about the uh long term considerations like retirement and college and stuff well i've got an annuity fund set up because i don't know uh just the way i was raised i look toward the future uh-huh uh-huh not only for my kids but for myself and i've got an annuity for me and every two months i buy my boys each a savings bond uh-huh every since they have been born i've been doing that that sounds great so um so now what exactly in an annuity i've always found those a little confusing an annuity is an account it's like a uh it's it's a type of savings account okay but you don't touch it you just deposit money into it but you don't touch it other than that and it just sits there and gains interest until your retirement okay okay now do you pay taxes on the interest not right now okay only when you draw it out if right okay and like if elderly people they have a choice of having an IRA account and they get special discounts on like the um uh-huh what's the word i'm trying to think of the interest charges and stuff if they have an IRA they get special rates on it and stuff you mean from the you mean from taxes or from from the federal government you mean uh-huh right right for the elderly people and stuff that have IRAs set up and they get special discounts on that but an an annuity is it's a savings account that you don't withdraw anything out of you just keep depositing money into it okay now i guess the question is is it better than an  um so what do you think um i lived i lived in Sweden for two years and in Sweden they have socialized medicine and so i saw some of the good and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program uh-huh uh-huh uh some of the some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care right so it's a very it's a very uh comfortable i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that you know there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life right um the bad was more apparent i think at least for me because i think it affected people's lives on in a way that you could see one one thing that i noticed is it's very very convenient to be alcoholic in Sweden oh really because it's treated as a disease now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine but uh if you're if you're alcoholic then you're treated as if you're on disability long-term disability and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that hum also um another thing that that i noticed that was very strange i was uh i would go down all these uh i remember this one row of houses and they were uh row houses or townhouses all connected together so it was like lower middle-class housing well it'd be lower middle-class housing here it's probably um-hum middle-class housing there um and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these and there was a doctor that lived in one of these the one guy was a doctor and one was a taxi driver and so uh-huh their their incomes were about the same hum whereas here there's a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward and that that didn't exist in Sweden right right and uh overall i guess their their health care suffered a fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower and it was it was less professional and it was treated more like a like a taxi driver type job then a then a doctor type job yeah i that is uh that is something i've heard i i had a friend uh that i worked with that was from Sweden and that was uh probably the major the major concern i have is that you know we are leading in the technology realm of of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to to get into uh the medical field but at the same time um it's real hard i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance and so you know i'm real you know it's like well you know you know there's got to be better ways you know to do some things but you know i hate to uh the the competition in in a lot of ways is is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor and and uh they have to compete to be to be good and to be knowledgeable but at the same time there's a you know they're regulating themselves and and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for my i have a brother who's a vet and for something that he can get you know wholesale and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they they hospitals buy in such a bulk rate um right you know they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item and that's ridiculous and i don't think that is that is um abnormal in any means to be doing things like that and you don't think it's abnormal i don't think that is that is uh abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all oh i see you're not saying it's right you're just saying it's common it yeah and so it it it's i think i to me i think uh something that's going to help our medical uh arena is for um uh and i don't know how to i don't know how to do this but i think people are too lawsuit happy and i mean things will happen and and you've got to uh keep up or you've got to realize that you know uh it is just men or women that are that are making um decisions and they will make mistakes and you know if if people you know uh there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it but there are other things that just happen that you can't you know you can't say you know well if you had just done this you know things would have done differently and um i don't know i i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically um in in the in the last number of years and i think that's something that if if they could work on yes the cause of that and  so um are you working right now uh yes i am i'm working in the computer science department here uh at CMU uh what kind of what kind of work do you do uh i'm doing basically system system design work and uh implementation work for the speech um-hum for the speech group uh here ah what is that how you heard about this thing yeah actually through electronic mail uh uh-huh me too i work at uh the Georgia Tech Research Institute um-hum um i'm a co-op student so i work and go to school about halftime and uh i really don't have any job benefits to speak of we're kind of um i don't know they just kind of forget us on that end we don't really have any vacation or you know sick days or health care or anything really so right so your pretty they're they've got you slaving away at at this point yeah well um exactly exactly what about you i'm research staff here now so what they they have uh um okay benefits package it's not quite as good as industry but one of the significant um benefits here is that you can take uh up to two courses a semester um and they pay for you know pay for the classes so for Carnegie Mellon that works out to be um a reasonable a reasonable benefit hm yeah uh they do that i think if you're uh research title staff here then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters and i think that um they might you know pay for that pay for the classes and stuff but i know they let you they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by any kind of percentage you know they'll let you work halftime if you want to if you wanna finish you wanna um-hum if you wanted to do it quickly yeah if they'll let you work decrease your number of hours by any percentage just just about so if if you wanna get your masters and then i think of course you get like a with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due so um-hum um-hum that'll probably help out but yeah yeah so i i don't know in in terms of other things other benefits other than sort of monetary i'd you know i do you get any kind of health care type stuff yeah we we do we have to contribute a certain amount uh to it uh-huh and it's kind of split between CMU and and you know the employee yeah yeah i think i mean that's pretty important that's a pretty important uh part of it there because that that can be really expensive if you ever have any health problems my dad i think my i'm still covered on with my dad's uh health plan at his where he works but right it definitely be something to look into i guess once i get my own yeah yeah and it's also right now it's uh the like everywhere else uh here in Pittsburgh the health care uh rates are are going up pretty quickly uh-huh that's a whole nother topic yes to begin with too but yeah but it's you're right i i i really agree that that that's pretty important the only i think the i guess the only real um benefit i guess you could say working for me working here besides i mean i'm learning and stuff because i'm at you know in school but right right there's there's some weird law where um um student employees working for the government don't have to pay Social Security tax um-hum oh now that's a big win though that's about five percent right there so yeah yeah uh that's that's about the only real bonus yeah i have so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid relative you know because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to you know pay an extra five percent or so yeah i figured for and they've just raised the um income caps on Social Security to the point where you have to be pretty you have to be pretty well off before you stop paying hm yeah paying that as well yeah well if you could call it a benefit that CMU i mean the the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is is consult for um you know other companies oh yeah um so that's that kind of helps out in terms of you know keeping up-to-date with contacts in industry um-hum yeah i imagine that'd help a lot you know in case you know in case you ever need to bail out yeah see around around here it's like uh we pretty much work from project to project on well you know with different sponsors um-hum a there's not there's not a whole lot of you know funded research from  okay so uh Mike what are your opinions on uh trial by jury well i work for an insurance company so i see a lot of uh verdicts that are pretty crazily decided um by juries particularly and i know in England the judges set all of the awards you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence but then they leave the awards up to more learned people and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous you know like millions and millions of dollars um-hum yeah that that seems to make sense that leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the uh kind of the rate for different incidents oh exactly each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what um the going you know if you will the going uh award should be for a certain type of case you know within some kind of range um-hum when you get one way out like that that then really doesn't penalize wind up penalizing the person that they went after who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us right if they get some of those mega awards against them you know they're not going to sit there and lose money if they're losing money then they're going to raise rates right that they have to so it all comes filtering down to us all individually individually individually right and uh granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged well you know how do you feel about setting like well for example a a car type accident where uh or some incident where someone loses a limb do you think that jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm a dollar figure for losing different body parts it i don't know you know some of the health insurance is written that way you know that uh if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy you know it specifies pre specifies in the policy uh so much but i don't know that you can necessarily put a a value on somebody's limb uh arbitrarily that is always going to fit in all cases i think maybe um-hum you look at uh the age of the person and their station in life and and uh how much longer they have of work years that they would have to put up you know with with that i mean maybe you don't award an eighty five year old guy the same thing that you'd award a twenty one year old hm i i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there and that may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that stuff type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing and it could be part of continuing education maybe for judges i don't know you know to get into the economics of things uh um-hum yeah right because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards it really you know ultimately is not penalizing the person that they're trying to get anyway yeah that's true if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages i think those should be uninsurable i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that that did the damage hm oh out of their as opposed to the corporation insurance paying the bills yeah type thing yeah uh-huh well we're for for honest mistakes where they've done something and and something happens one of their employees causes damage or something sure that's what they buy insurance for but what who who do they get they get insured they get insured from other insurance companies or how does that work well i was just talking about any company oh okay your talking about corporate uh let's just say a lumber manufacturing company and uh somebody is on the premises and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift and he pushes the wrong button and he drops a load of lumber on somebody and it injures them sure insurance should pay for that sure okay well but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings well i'm not talking about any loss i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they're due and then they're awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is a lot usually a lot less but it's uh an amount their designed to sting them a little for their negligence for gross wanton negligence in a claim okay for oh um-hum and unfortunately the jury the lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too um-hum so again it never really penalizes the company doing the wrong they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to right they don't hm and if they if they know some practice is wrong you know i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences i'm talking more about the you know the thing that they know maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there and they continue to do it even after they become aware of that sure okay then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket  so do you keep a family budget well not a real strict one but we do work hard at saving for the future and do that primarily through uh payroll reduction at my employment that's a good way to do it what what we usually do my wife and i fortunately she likes to keep the numbers and i i don't um uh-huh so what what happens is uh i make the money and she spends it but she spends it carefully and then at the end of the month she just tallies it up and uh we have basically categories spend this much in this area this much in that area and uh although i don't keep that in mind as we spend we do um kind of get to the end of the month and see how we did uh-huh and uh you know at the beginning of the month too we also take out some some savings and put them aside so we we know we don't have that to spend that appears to work pretty well i actually use a computer to keep track of our family uh expenses i enter all the all the checks that we write and most of the cash that we spend and all the credit card transactions into a computer program that and keeps track of where all of our expenses go and every few months i look at that to get an overall idea of of uh how our expenses compare to my income and make sure that we're not getting a beyond uh what we should be spending in any particular area and try and figure out for the for the year whether we're going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time um-hum do you have a uh specialized program or do you or do you just use something like a spreadsheet uh it's a specialized personal finance program and it seems to seems to work real well we've got uh a couple of those but uh i've been trying to get get my wife sold on a spreadsheet uh-huh and have her uh doing it that way and she prefers still just to do it by hand um huh she says as long as she's dealing with the numbers and it's just adding them up and then subtracting from the the target totals she says it's just as quick to do that way as to to uh enter it on the computer and have it check the arithmetic yeah i think i think generally people do find that that probably is just as quick to keep by hand the only question is whether whether the additional reports and the uh so you know the the nice record keeping that it gives you is worth a little bit of extra time well that's kind of the way i feel and uh i use spreadsheets a lot and a lot more than she does so i feel like she's you know if if she did do it for a couple months she'd probably like it but she was just that right right do you have any uh any particular ways that that feeds into your long-term uh savings or retirement plan um our as far as our family budget goes yeah what we do is we kind of know what what we're making and we've been doing keeping track long enough that we know what we need to spend and pretty much all the difference yeah goes uh well it goes into two or three different places what have what we call an education account where we put aside some money for each of our children every month uh-huh right with the desperate fear that by the time they are old enough to use it it's not going to be enough anyway have have you right and uh then we have kind of just a savings account and and right now all we've been doing is taking that and and putting it away in a money market account we haven't been investing or anything like that uh huh yet we just moved last year into a home just last week bought a car and so we have some kind of substantial other commitments to take care of right now but makes it difficult yeah we uh you know we even with all that we're still able to put some aside yeah how about you well i contribute as much as i can to our four O one K plan at work and we also have a a uh company stock purchase plan which i contribute to and between those two that's that's pretty much all that we're able to save but fortunately those are fairly substantial and i feel like that's at this point the uh the the most important part of our long-term uh savings plans and then hoping the hoping if i get a few raises that i'll be able to get beyond that but right now that's all i'm able to save well it's it's nice to have something you know people say that if you're if you're not saving money you're spending more than you earn and uh that's probably the case uh-huh right you know you never can live down to the last dime so you're either coming out ahead or coming out behind right i know we're just getting started on our family so  so you keep a budget uh not really all i i just have one commitment and that is that at the end of the month that uh that everything is paid and that's basically my budget that's your budget eh so we use credit cards and uh let's see what else and when i get a when i get a uh a bill in the mail i write a check out for it immediately yep put a date on the outside of the envelope stick it in my little Franklin Planner and uh i carry it around and then on the day that i'm supposed to mail it why mail it and that way i know how much i'm in the hole so basically my budget is uh based on if uh the bank account's low why we don't spend very much yeah my uh wife and i we're new young couple starting out so we've been trying to budget it's getting a lot a lot tighter and we've actually worked out a very extensive year long budget oh wow so we know exactly what we're gonna spend when and when we're gonna have money and we've worked out a cash flow we just bought a house which is another reason why we're really keeping track of the pennies and that stuff oh yeah and so we have this detailed budget and in some ways it's really kind of nice because there's not much of a worry or not much a discussion or any real conflict over whether we should do this or that or we always have a there's a sense of confidence a little bit because we both know that we're going to have money to do what we said we're going to do yeah now you have a consensus yeah we as my brother told me when he he's in accounting and he suggested we do this as we were ahead of time huh making these big financial steps and all this stuff and he said well you just do this and you fight once and and that's it once a year and that's it because you've worked out the budget and what you're going to spend ah that's very good i've i'm uh i i tried that in the beginning and when when when i say tried it i we tried to sit down there was no consensus ah uh we both agreed that uh how shall i say it was the best consensus we could get was uh we're both are pretty thrifty and and uh you know it just we'll just watch our we just won't spend money uh big items we'll kind of talk to each other about but we have two we're playing uh Russian Roulette i guess although we've been married uh how many years now uh let's see twenty six twenty seven years now doesn't sound sounds like you guys have gotten something worked out that's gonna work just fine well it's it what it is it's just a kind of a commitment not to spend too much yeah and uh so the uh but the uh the budget idea sounds pretty good i think if if if we ever had one of these financial crisis you know like a oh an an emergency of some kind a job uh loss or something like that we'd have to we'd have to do that but neither one of us are predicting what what i do with her is i we have two bank accounts um-hum one i i wanted to uh i wanted her to uh to learn how to balance her checkbook because she's she just the the best she can do is is keep it uh current so to speak so what i did was i gave her another checkbook and i said okay you this is your account you can have money anytime you yeah want it just tell me how much is in your account um-hum she said no you are trying to control me i said i'm not you know you can have six hundred dollars in there if you want another three hundred just tell me and uh so finally we got we have one of these uh things where we get money the company puts makes a direct deposit yes so i give her let's see what she gets uh like a third of the money for the household and i pay everything else yeah what we've done see we've only been married three years and i my my wife isn't real good with checkbooks and math and all that stuff and so what i did is i just gave it all to her and i said you have to do it everything and then i come in and help her i think that's good and uh that's been really good because it's you know we've both come to appreciate and understand what's going on and she does most everything now and it's really quite nice actually and uh i i think that's good one one of my uh friends suggested that that life would be a little easier around our house even yet if i had her do do that because  well i think um for at least for me uh because my sister is looking for day care one of the things that we talked about as being very important is the um um-hum the in the teacher to uh the number of kids um-hum because if you've got a lot a large number of children one teacher just won't cut it right even if it's in the home i think this is important even if it's a private home situation right right and not a day care um-hum um probably number one too would be close references if you know people that have had the experience at they hands on experience of one right would be very important word of mouth word of mouth is good uh something that i don't think many people know about and i this is just something i've heard not something i've actually experienced um checked into is that um the agency that uh that license um friends um agencies agencies to care for kids like home either home or day care you can you can request to see if they have had any problems in the past um-hum um-hum is what i've been told um-hum that would be a good a good resource to check right right and all of course better business i would check any of your business um any type of thing references of that type um-hum as well as your word of mouth if you were putting them in uh uh school or any day care type you know that's public um-hum you know what i mean like a church or a school type thing yeah oh yeah oh yeah i would check that awfully close um i'd go in often yes and in and there's some places i'm sorry go ahead unexpectedly unexpectedly wherever they where right because then there's some places and i would and i would don't this would be a a big minus for the places there are some places that state that you cannot come in unannounced um-hum you have to have an appointment or you know or whatever and i don't think you know if there hum-um um-hum um-hum i wouldn't do that i mean i wouldn't not put my child in there though would you no no never you know i would never have a controlled situation not with a little one especially yes you know that's not a not a good situation on that and i think you've also got to look you know whenever you go in and you know talk to the talk to the the the teachers and look at the toys that they have and the environment that the kids'll be in um-hum um-hum um-hum right that's real important i believe so too to meet the and administrators as well and really kind of yes research it and get an idea of how they feel about things you know have your questions ready on their feelings on things and all um-hum um-hum kind of how they basically anyway because they you know that's um seventy percent your child's life um-hum you know is developing is there yeah so that's real important do you have any children in it yourself no um i like i said my sister's in the process of trying to find one for hers your sister is um-hum yeah it's a scary thing my daughter's been in Houston and had to do it you know just out of the cold she's had to um-hum but she's been real fortunately in finding women in their homes right and uh right and and that's a good situation but it can it can it can turn bad with older children um-hum um i was in a day care until i was thirteen just during like in the summers uh-huh uh-huh and what we found was and what finally got me out of this women's home was the fact that she would go off shopping with some of the older kids and leave me there to care for the little ones oh wow yeah you know and i mean this went on for a summer for a you know good two and a half months um-hum you know and it's her daily thing you know and so if you've got older children that you just don't want to leave at home um-hum um-hum sometimes a day care a a a private home or a day care setting is not the best not the best situation yeah yeah that's for sure right right so but oh and another one is is how they discipline um-hum um i know depending a couple of the day cares that that i went to whenever i was younger um one of them disciplined whenever we were outside you hugged a tree and you had time out um-hum um-hum whereas you know i've heard of some agencies you know that get into the physical discipline um-hum um-hum and you you really have to find a discipline that that matches your beliefs yes right and what you would want done right yeah or yeah right because it gets it can it can become very confusing for the child um-hum so i would think so oh yeah yeah hm what about um well i'm in i'm in nursing um-hum so one thing i would look at would be um the cleanliness and the care health care the cleanliness and the care the health that's right the certification of the of the teachers teachers um-hum um-hum right because there's a new state law mandating that everyone that works in a day care um-hum knows knows infant and child CPR right but there's a lot of places  it seems to me that the the benefits of working for a big company tend to be the the same things that that are to their determent um they aren't as as responsive both to like bad economic times you don't have to worry about your job all of a sudden disappearing yeah but when you see a job when you see a a job that needs to be done sometimes you have to fill out the five forms in triplicate in order to to get it done you know what i mean yeah yeah see i work for a really small company it's just me and my boss oh wow so it's really small and i think it's really nice because you know it's it's real easy we don't really have much to do but it's just me and him so if he needs something done i do it or you know it just goes straight from me to him and we don't have to go through a bunch of people like you're saying but right but sometimes it's kind of bad because if i'm sick then i kind of i usually have to go in unless i'm you know have to stay in bed because i'm the only one there yeah there is that i mean well and then i guess again i i guess like i said when i when i started off that the advantages tend to be the same things that the disadvantages i mean if i don't show up for for work there's probably somebody else that could fill my spot but yeah um i imagine and and that's nice but uh it's would it's also nice to be able to uh yeah know that that you are the person that that makes things get done you know if if you're not there it doesn't happen yeah yeah and also also in big companies they have uh like vacations and all no if i take a vacation i've got to get a friend or someone else to come in for a temporary to come in for a week yeah oh wow oh wow yeah so so it's pretty nice being able to take off and have someone else take your take up your time and all um-hum so you know one other benefit that that just occurred to me i didn't take it as much advantage of it at least not yet in sometimes big companies will pay for like education oh yeah yeah i had some friends of mine uh get sent up to Stanford for a year for uh college or for like for grad school and i guess getting stuck in California for the summer is is not such a bad thing yeah yeah you know but uh a friend of mine works for a a stockbroker and um it's a really it's a big company and they said that um uh-huh as a after she works there a year as long as she takes business courses they'll reimburse her uh-huh so that's pretty nice so that she could move up in the company yeah and that's pretty nice my job won't do that yeah yeah but i would think that a a smaller company you would have a i mean if if if a small company hits some niche in the some niche market that that it is uniquely qualified to um take care of it has a chance to to grow really fast yeah and if you can get on top of it before before it goes up i mean you know if all of a sudden the company expanded to like you know three thousand people you would probably be one of the top people yeah of course i guess if there's only the two of you you'll i mean i guess you're you're one of the top two people but you are also in the bottom half so yeah so uh um the only other thing i can think of is uh uh stuff for things like uh like if if there's some kind of child care if if someone were married and had kids yeah that's bigger companies might have something like that yeah that would be nice and uh um like like it's their i guess another advantage might be that uh if they if it's big a big enough company and it has multiple sites yeah um if you wanted to you could stay with the same company and decide you wanted to live in another part of the country yeah they moved uh my dad worked for i'm not even sure where but they moved us from Dallas to San Antonio and then back to Dallas so we kind of got moved around but it was pretty nice because you know we lived in San Antonio for a while and all i mean i guess it's nice if you have family that lives somewhere else and you want to be next be near them you can see it switch through the company to over at that state or whatever which i guess i being with a small company you wouldn't get forced to move but do you think uh do you think it was good to to move around or not yeah i do i mean i think it kind of helped us because you know we weren't just living in Dallas and didn't exactly know just everything about Dallas and you know i mean i doubt seriously that if we had stayed here that i would have been able to move to to get to San Antonio very much so oh you had family in San Antonio no we had family in Dallas and we moved to San Antonio and we were kind of like everybody else is in Oklahoma and Louisiana oh okay so but i guess it was pretty nice because you know we got to experience living down there somewhere different see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company yeah a number of people but uh although it's getting smaller every every day um and we moved like oh man we used to move like every every three years at least yeah and like i don't know i mean there's well there's i i've kept in touch with some people from college but but i don't i mean i don't really know i can't i wouldn't i couldn't  hello Larry sounds like you've got this uh huh sounds like you're ready to take a stab at it so why don't you go ahead okay well i you know i think that uh i think it's fine to do that but i don't think it should be mandatory i'm not i'm not for having the equivalent of a draft yeah i happen to uh this will be a real short one cause i happen to agree with you uh i think in principal it is a very very good thing but when you make it mandatory uh now you're talking about slavery that's right it's uh it comes down to um the uh it's kind of fun because i had picked the same topic uh last time i dialed in and uh you know which i didn't know it would do um oh is that right you know one of the uh things they're trying to think of is ways you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it uh um-hum more desired and respected in society for people to voluntarily uh engage in public service um-hum well i'd say as far as government jobs uh they could uh have some incentive for instance veterans get a preference when they're applying for a government job and i'd say people at um-hum had voluntarily served in such a thing as the Peace Corps or or something yeah yeah could also get that yeah the uh what do you call it um not sure how you would do that outside of a government sector though and uh i don't know either and i'm not sure we'd want it you know i i kind of hope against reality sadly that uh that government sector will get smaller with time but every indication is that it won't huh-uh right you know i feel the same way yeah uh i think that uh i have nothing against the draft when you know when when the nation needs it uh but obviously when you don't need it you don't have a draft and i feel the same thing with universal service if there was a need for it then i'd say uh possibly i mean but it would to be an emergency type thing and i and i don't see that ever happening uh you know my uh my interpretation of history is is is that uh when there's a real need there's usually no shortage of volunteers you know you look at what happened uh in California with the earthquake there were plenty of people volunteering you know you look at World War Two there were plenty of volunteers um-hum that's right uh you look at from the war in Vietnam all of a sudden there weren't a whole lot of volunteers um-hum and uh you know the question of when do you quote need unquoted on a say for example a draft uh maybe it should be the other way around maybe the willingness of people to volunteer should be determining whether you need it or not um-hum that's that's true yeah cause uh you know if all you got to do is uh print up a few million draft cards to start a war you know you it may be a powerful incentive you know what do you call it um right by volunteer may be a powerful incentive for keeping people out of uh you know keep keeping us out of may make it a little more difficult to get into war you know there are times you need to right um-hum i don't perceive myself as a pacifist by any means but um you know there are probably there are places we've been over the years that perhaps we shouldn't have ah i don't think every time we uh wandered into some place it was honest just in itself i think we've screwed up a few times just like everybody else um-hum right i think about on on public service too i think it has some some thought has to be given to what do we want these people to do in public service and and that would have a bearing on what training should they have because if you wanted to have people you know as an incentive you can have people go in after high school indeed um and then offer them assistance with their college and that way you'd be getting people who really didn't have any expertise in any particular but uh any particular field but they'd be willing hands so so to speak on public service projects um well you know i i will say i given a choice between somebody with expertise and no interest in working and someone who is enthusiastic but lacks the skill i'll take the enthusiasm any day cause you can train that person um-hum right um-hum but somebody that's got no incentive i i'm not really sure what you can do are you familiar with the Civilian Conservation Corps back in the thirties um no that was before my time okay well i mean it's before my time too but i i read about it but you know in the height of the depression the government employed people to go work on public service projects uh-huh was it like uh WPA that's right like WPA it was the same thing and there were many uh a lot of the national parks were built up by the Civilian Conservation Corps and a lot of WPA projects are still uh-huh um-hum serving the the nation yeah yeah so uh something you know uh unskilled people could could do things like that as long as they had a positive attitude hm yeah my only concern about projects like that you know there my concern is uh you've got this resource whether it's uh unemployed people whether it's volunteers what have you you've got this resource and what is the best way to target where you're going to point it uh um-hum you know i don't know the answer to that i'm not automatically  Steve this is like i mentioned Brian and i guess we're going to want to be talking about child care uh do you have any experience in uh finding child care well ourselves we have i guess never had to look for child care our kids are now fourteen and eighteen but uh and so you know you go back uh-huh those many years and uh we didn't do it very much we i guess we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at uh two family income at the time uh-huh uh-huh and our kids were older but i've had to deal with uh you know friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing right uh so it my involvement hasn't been direct but still have been you know certainly exposed to criteria people are using how about yourself uh-huh well uh we're kind of lucky i i'm uh i'm working my wife isn't working and she is taking care of the kids also and and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice but i do have like you mentioned a lot of friends a lot of uh coworkers and associates that are looking for child care and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care uh what kind of you know uh guidance counselor to student or you know uh adult to child relationship how many you know you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult right right then uh something happens and the adult wouldn't be able to uh accommodate or take care of the kids very well and uh well they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time so you know depends also upon the the level of the child we uh we uh take a very close look at finding a a preschool a good preschool for our kid and i kind of relate that to that in in making sure that the uh-huh the uh teachers are very well educated themselves they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them and it's very important i feel uh that the kids interact with other children also it's a it's a good way to develop relationships with other kids their age and uh get to know and work with kids so i don't know i i guess we're kind of in the same boat we haven't had to look very carefully for child care yeah i i kind of think that uh you know some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care but even you know here i guess we have uh-huh in one sense two forms of uh child care there's where individuals will in one primarily babysit children in their own home and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to maybe seven or eight children uh-huh uh-huh and then otherwise there will be the majority are cooperative day cares uh people form a co-op and uh parents will work in the co-op and put a fair number of hours frequently they will hire staff to be at the day care and the emphasis is primarily uh someplace for the children to be but at the same time there's some fairly good training programs uh-huh and and some of them formal two year programs right right uh so that you know there is some definite uh creative play good social interaction that kind of thing i think it's uh important like you mentioned that's a good idea on the uh parent co-op because uh i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere i want to trust the people yeah and uh you know you hear in the newspaper you hear on the T V and you read the newspaper quite often of of people that you know don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of so and hope to never get into that situation where we have to have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children and hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile so yeah you know we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here and i guess uh-huh you know it are it's uh typically uh whether it's been child care in a home uh-huh or in a larger situation where actually it's more of an institution and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children and it's not and it's more of a group home rather than actually day care type of facility uh so yeah that's true that's true well Steven it's been so  okay uh before a couple of years ago i had a a very narrow view of of nursing homes and it was uh more like a funeral home i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home and uh then i had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler Texas and i went to one and it just had a very good activities director everyone was cheerful and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore but i i certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last resort resort um i have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics well that sounds good yeah so uh she she's real interested in uh what Ann Richards has been doing she's Ann Richards is really cracking down on uh the nursing homes and i don't know you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor i've heard the name and that's about all it goes okay Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes and uh my sister's real interested in that and and getting into the to that side of nursing yeah that's one problem with the the nursing home environment it the elderly even out of the nursing home are very open to abuse right um you know they don't always have their full wits about them they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on um-hum um-hum and it can be pretty sad i've got a had a grandmother who had a stroke and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died oh and you know it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida my families was up in Maryland um-hum and the other part of her family was up in uh New York state right and you know it was very difficult for either of them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was um you know could not do very much for herself after the stroke right and you know the nursing home was the you know best facility to put her in uh-huh you know besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my uh aunts and uncle work right which means it's you know very difficult for someone you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full time right and you know there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in home right which makes it you know it's a necessary evil i think um-hum it sure is and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive because because they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older yeah yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry oh yeah and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes right my grandfather passed away several years ago i was much younger but um he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him everyday my grandmother did but uh if she couldn't someone visited him every day it was in a very small town nursing home uh-huh and uh people didn't get paid much there at all they didn't care about what went on yeah they would let a let a patient get a lot of bed sores uh-huh and uh the the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people and then the nurses and doctors really didn't put any forth forth any loving care for them either that or they're just so understaffed that they uh can't afford to put in the uh care that they need right right because it's you know an elderly person can you know it's like a newborn baby you need to have twenty four hour care um-hum right uh answering all the needs because they can't do much for themselves at certain points right and the nurses get so worn down uh-huh and you know there's a lot of number of the elderly are very you know complaining because they remember the way that things used to be right and remember being able to do things for themselves which you know they no longer can oh sure and they feel and it very very hard for them to accept that they feel pretty helpless we just uh moved my grandfather into not a nursing home but you know a transitional type facility is it uh like a retirement center more of a retirement home he's got his own efficiency apartment and they provide one meal a day uh-huh uh-huh and you know the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him but they do have you know group activities going on uh-huh how's he handling that uh he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida um-hum uh you know to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and oh it's it's a bit of a shock to the system weatherwise if nothing else oh sure there wasn't anything like that that you could do in Florida well there was stuff like that in Florida but  well it's uh i'll start off here uh i don't know i get probably most of my information either from the newspaper or from CNN um i like CNN because it uh you know repeats it well Headline News repeats every half hour and so it it makes it really convenient because i keep a rather hectic schedule right yeah and uh but the newspaper provides provides a little bit of depth that you can't really get from yeah i i think i'd agree of of of a similar method of getting the news with me too it's uh uh CNN has been a welcome addition to the T V scene here in the last uh number of years uh prior prior to cable you know you didn't get much news off of normal uh television broadcasts right uh just usually pretty local in in nature and and i like uh CNN because you get some world world events too um-hum uh which is not too common on on the other format newspapers and so forth right yeah i know the my only major objection is that uh i don't think American media spends enough uh attention on on our closest neighbors like Mexico and Canada uh that that's true you know you hardly ever see uh headline articles about the uh either the economics or or other world news events going on in either of those countries um-hum yeah uh whereas if you pick up a a European paper you know uh it all the surrounding countries Soviet Union and everything has uh major news uh articles in them right yeah i mean you know Canada's going through a lot of problems now with with Quebec and and everything and uh it's amazing that you know i i listen to DC area and the Washington Post you know i mean the most they'll give it is maybe the back of the A section yeah um you know well i'm i'm currently living in Dallas and it it won't it won't even give it the back section you just never see you just never see anything about it uh which is a shame because you go to other countries uh and and they carry quite a bit about the US on the other hand and if you go up to uh Canada those people are usually pretty uh familiar with the politics going on and and the news events in the US and um-hum and we're pretty uh limited in our understanding of of leaders up in Canada or Mexico yeah definitely you just you just don't know what's going on yeah i'd i every once in a while i have to travel overseas and then lately i've taken the taken a little shortwave radio uh around and picking up the BBC and it's sort of like uh a CNN too you you can tune into some stations and you get some like thirty minute summaries of of news events uh um-hum i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern uh area and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all there's not much in the way of television in some of those places right um but that's a good point about about the neighboring countries i hadn't really thought about it but i guess you don't think about it because you don't hear it right exactly yeah i uh spent this past summer up in Canada uh well part of it touring and uh you know i i was amazed because i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these you know really interesting things going on there's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a a Canada you know in the next five years yeah you know because of the problems with Quebec and never i had never heard any of that before yeah yeah you know there was a a what is it called is it Meech Lake Accord or or yeah that's just something uh um-hum i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in Calgary a couple of years ago and you know picked up a a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it and and came came and it was a big thing going on there and i came back here and nothing in the papers right right and just didn't see a thing about it so it's uh we've got a long ways to go i guess it's improved and like i say with CNN and and uh the cable news even even there's a uh it's sort it's semireligious in some respects but what is it it's uh i mean its news is not not that way uh oh i'm trying to think of the channel the Christian the Christian Science Monitor oh yeah uh it it surprised me i've caught it a few times and they they do some pretty good news uh seemingly unbiased news broadcasts uh um-hum uh the the title of the network is sort of surprising you'd think it would carry mostly religious but it it doesn't seem to so i'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too uh and catch something maybe a little different than than CNN might be covering uh some more interest interest type topics in in other countries but it's kind of world world uh network too yeah um i've i guess i've never seen the TV show i used to get the uh  what what were you saying okay i i think we're started now oh okay uh do you wanna go ahead and start um well i haven't really been up to date on a lot music i have been in school and i haven't really gone out and bought any or listened to much on the on the radio except for classical and well you like classical music uh yes uh i like classical music i like rock and roll i like country and western um-hum uh i i like all kinds i like i like different things about each one of them okay well i like most of them except for country oh you don't like country music no i think i i might like dancing to it but i don't like listening to it the the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music not the not the kind like Kenny Rogers and stuff like that that's uh which oh that's a little bit to uh it it's like they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing you know what i mean uh-huh what what's the old country music like oh like like Hank Williams like the old Hank Williams even even Hank Williams Junior is real good stuff the kind that uh uh-huh oh okay this stuff makes you cry it sounds so sad i mean you that's the kind you like you mean yeah sometimes sometimes i do i mean not all the time oh oh okay well i guess i i like the blues a lot and i guess you could say it's similar as far as yes and i the kind of the way they do it i i do too i also like jazz yeah me too too so i guess i like except heavy metal and uh most rap i don't like yeah you're you're about like i am then uh i i can't watch MTV anymore i used to love MTV yeah oh okay and i can i can barely watch anymore because uh they have this heavy metal stuff on there and and i can't even you know i can't like that and and i liked uh Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin and uh yeah uh-huh okay you know and uh jeez who else is that uh Van Halen now i like i like groups like that but when you get uh okay yeah i i even like Guns and Roses some of their stuff um-hum but uh yeah some of these groups now like Slaughter oh i have i really haven't listened to that some of them are just really rough so so you went to school then in i'm surprised you didn't go to to any parties parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff or well um i used to a long time ago but since i've started back into school now i haven't really done that much i've been pretty busy um but um oh okay so no i haven't i you know i used to go out and dance a lot but i don't do that anymore either so oh i see are you married at all no i've just been real busy with with lots of other things oh okay well how old are you twenty eight okay so you you were out of school you went to school for awhile then quit then went back well no i i went to school and got a degree and then i worked for awhile and then i just started i started back a year and a half ago changed direction oh okay yeah how old are you i'm uh twenty eight i was born in sixty three so i guess we're the same age then huh oh okay all right yeah and uh i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because uh my parents didn't really have music in the house put it that way oh really were they religious yes ah i see i so i'm always behind i'm i'm not i'm never really up to date on all that stuff but i know what i like when it's uh when i like a sound a certain kind of sound yeah see my my parents were very musical my mother had a piano in the in the house uh um-hum my father likes uh country western music okay he's from uh West Virginia so that's what he grew up listening to and he's always liked it and and you know he's probably about fifty three years old now so he grew up like in the late fifties and uh-huh huh you know when they had that the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that and the and that kind of rock and roll so he likes that and my mom always liked that kind of stuff my mom likes like uh Doris Day yeah yeah um oh really you know she always had those these old Doris Day records and stuff like that though so you know i i grew up listening to that stuff but uh oh row yeah i could see why you went uh you know i could see why you were kind of sheltered i guess from from music yeah well i i do play the piano you know but um i i like the um early seventies late sixties rock oh okay oh okay kind of stuff the old stuff and uh yeah so do i do do you like uh like Van Van Halen or anything like that or how about Bryan Adams um Bryan what kind of music is does what songs does he play it it it this uh Love Cuts Like a Knife uh Summer of 69 uh-huh i think i've heard Summer of 69 yeah he sings that he's he's from Canada yeah okay i'm not i am not very good at remembering the uh titles yeah but i can remember the the song yeah titles and artists yeah well do do you watch music television MTV at all or VH1 no no i don't watch TV much at all oh okay yeah do do you get cable so no oh okay that's that's you have to get c able to get those stations anyhow no yeah so but uh yeah i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos i like watching that kind of thing it's um-hum do you like um like someone recent like Enya have you ever head of her she's not rock but no i haven't heard her she she's from Ireland oh okay and uh she's gotten some uh she's been on like the top ten i guess or whatever oh really she she did the Orinoco Flow  how do you get your current events are you a po couch potato or well actually no uh it's it's multifaceted for me since i'm married to a news junkie oh is that right uh yeah we we get the you know about three papers a day plus there's four different newscasts that we watch and of course if there's nothing else um worth doing or watching on television we'll watch either headline news or CNN itself and uh plus i'm a member of a an electronic community and i get a lot of news that way so uh um-hum it's really pretty hard to not be informed that's right yeah how about yourself well i start out the day listening to the radio on my you know as i'm getting ready for work and in the evenings and and i'm in a vacuum all day except what news i get electronically we have uh electronic news at work uh-huh uh the lunch table discussion usually brings up a few things that people have seen in the paper that morning and i haven't had time to read yeah and uh some more radio on the way home and it's usually too late to watch the news by the time i get home but i can uh read the newspaper then the morning news of course um-hum and of course everything's changed by that time and and oh of course of course and then uh the ten o'clock news at bedtime um-hum so that's about it i don't have cable TV now i used to do like you did and the default was CNN uh-huh you know and i could just i'd have that thing going for hours yeah they really have some fascinating stuff especially on the weekends uh we kind of uh we kind of like CNBC i don't know if you've ever seen it but it's a it's a cable well you don't have cable cable NBC hum and it's sort of like uh National Public Radio on cable television oh wow so they go into all sorts of neat little off the wall kind of topics that you normally wouldn't get in uh in uh in a conventional news broadcast or even on CNN it's sort of like socketed little special interest kinds of things and it's really fascinating to see you know they're out there covering it um one thing i wanted to ask you about was the you're you said you're in Dallas the quality of your local papers do you do you see um-hum pandering because well the the most noticeable thing about our two local papers is that we now have one local paper uh no The The Times Herald went out of business it was always the weak sister of the two okay uh and the Morning News uh managed somehow to acquire nearly all the comics and features that the Times Herald had been carrying uh-huh so i mean they just they just plundered the poor Times Herald i mean it was financial you can blame the syndicates for going where they're you know they got bigger bucks or whatever yeah well see we're a Gannett city um-hum and uh the Democrat and Chronicles and Times Union are our papers and a a few years ago they merged editorial boards however they still continue to publish they put out three additions well it's actually DNC puts out two one in the morning And the Times Union puts out two but they're virtually the same paper um-hum there's an there's an evening edition which comes out at noon and and the late edition which comes out at three and just to give you an idea of what i meant by pandering it's like sometimes they their news for the news for the incredible stupid or comatose wow the past two days the headlines have been massive storm hits area and it's like in case you're brain dead well you know oh well that explains all the snow you know as if someone was worried about it i just you know i i have to wonder uh yeah uh how how well they're serving us because uh you you they've they've got a lock on it they don't there's not that many there's a few alternative newspapers but they all all the alternative newspapers have this sort of an underground feel to them uh-huh and you you know you really can't trust them they're not i i think i need conservatism from my news i don't know i'm funny yeah just the facts please yeah just the facts and and i don't want really much of a slant on it at all i just want the news yeah you know i don't want uh someone judging the news for me that one of the most famous headlines and i think this was on the editorial page and i don't remember it exactly of the Dallas Morning News was was some story about how well people can read and the fact that they can't and the headline was something like Let's Ban Literacy and wait a minute that sounds fine at first they want to ban illiteracy i think think i think so Let's Ban Literacy but that's going to put you guys out of business don't you think that's right  all right uh i think we pay a little bit too much in taxes and we don't always get what we pay for i agree i'm particularly worried about Social Security since i'm at the end of the baby boomer generation and there's not gonna be any money left when i get through so i kind of feel like i'm supporting a lot of people and that it's just gonna go into a hole i don't think that i'm gonna get anything out of it when the time comes from yeah no it other than that yeah yeah i i kind of feel the same way you know you pay all this money into Social Security and then you're not gonna get anything back out of it you know yeah because you're paying for everybody that uses it now and it's not gonna be there when you need it right everybody there's not gonna be enough people to support us when we get our age up that way but yep we'll be supporting we're they're we're a lot of people right now supporting a few people and then when the time comes and it's a few people supporting a lot of people it's not gonna even out very fairly yeah um-hum that way i don't have to i don't worry about the other i don't have state taxes really because i'm from Texas so i'm happy with that i'm worried about it though because every year they sit there and try to put more taxes in you know yeah and they're trying to get property tax in our county but yeah well well well well i think some of the taxes that pay you know you're paying more for the people to to disburse the money out than you are for uh the money to be spent you know like on education and stuff yeah there's so much administration and nothing when it when it comes right down to it the overhead is it get everything gets eaten up in overhead and doesn't actually do do much yeah so i i feel like some of like i said some most of the taxes that we pay are not being used for what they're supposed to be used for yeah i was thinking the other day you know it was like no taxation without representation and so long ago and now we're just eaten alive by all this government that can't pay for itself and goes into debt more and more and more and more and we don't have much say about it yeah and the government doesn't seem to do a be doing a whole lot of things i like either uh yeah and and they like they use taxes to to make grants to people that they're going you know they wanna find out how come butterflies do fly and all other kinds and i think that's kind of stupid yeah and then this National Endowment for the Arts thing where they they put pornography up in the in the name of art you know um-hum and make me pay for it yeah my you know i i don't exactly appreciate that either i really get frustrated when government starts to do things that are immoral and then expect me to support them on it yeah and first you get to the point where it's like you feel like protesting by not paying just to make them understand that they can't do this just because you know it's our money they're using yep for it they can't just think well it's ours now we got it we can do what we want with it uh it says that i'm standing it it says i approve if i sit there and pay it and i get kind of upset about that yeah i can understand that because and uh it's it you know like you said it makes you upset and it makes me upset too when i hear stuff like that and i just heard on the news tonight where they all them people in Congress overdrafted themselves and they you know finally gonna come out with everybody's name now saying who done it well that's good so yeah you start to feel real powerless yep but on the other hand at least we're we're powerless in a lot of ways but then there's so many other countries that i'm glad i'm not in oh yeah you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um Liberia or uh Czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like i'd rather try to work from inside the system to change something than to throw away what we've got now oh yeah it would be pretty frightening the other way around it's kind of scary now seeing the way uh they're going over there oh yeah uh that and you know like a lot of our tax money goes to helping other countries and stuff and i think we ought to use a lot of that money here in the states before we send it to someplace else  so uh do you happen to be working for a large firm well it's about three hundred and fifty people i guess that's not large compared to some but it's big enough um-hum and they have a they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and i wish they did yeah you know they have a 401K but i put all the money into it um-hum they don't add anything what about you uh i work for a fairly large company it's got eight thousand people uh-huh and uh we do have health insurance and we don't have 4O1K plan stuff like that but we do have like retirement they kind of match up to you if you put six percent they match up to six percent and then the rest is whatever you want to put in if you put more than that or something like that oh that's a pretty good deal that's not bad now how long does it take for your contribution to vest God i don't know it's probably a long time i'm sure it's not till like twenty five years thirty years yeah the place i work at is health insurance is kind of expensive it's like you know hundred bucks a a month or something for a family yeah huh well i guess what we have is like a flex what they call a flex benefits plan where you you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need otherwise you can uh guess you can put also put money hold money back and then either use it or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or you can just have that money you know put in your paycheck yeah we have one of those use it or lose it plans too where uh they'll basically pay for uh you know child care type uh expenses i can send in a uh can send in a request for payment and they'll uh and they'll send me you know a check for the amount they withheld that's pretty good you know it's uh it saves a third off on taxes or something yeah well it depends on which company you work for i know that like the the the one plan that everyone seems to be in in my place is uh you know you uh think you call it plan D deductibles are really high it's like fifteen hundred dollars but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely if you're fairly relatively uh healthy then it's really unlikely that you're gonna use that much amount of money you know so the it you know someone did start a cost benefit analysis and ends up the best is they take a high deductible and and take a loss whatever whatever happens a be if you happen to be a healthy individual yeah i guess uh on the other hand you know i i had a similar had a similar health plan and uh one of my kids was in a car accident and and i had wound up having to pay for you know a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of um you know no no insurance policy happened to cover it which is really you mean not even your dour your car insurance well it it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance no fault here and and i had a high deductible on the on the uh on the car car insurance and then you know we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and oh that's too bad blew it oh well yeah uh well i don't know i think other than health insurance i think uh you know an extra week of uh time off would be nice i only get two weeks yeah yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks oh that's nice we don't get them till till your seventh year of service till you get an extra week aye that's a long time yeah it's uh yeah especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in you know companies don't stay afloat that long and and they uh with the telecommunications type of company supposedly you used it used to be much more stable it's a lot less stable than it used to be they used to have job security and crap but now they don't so you work for Bell or something like that yeah it's the Bell Corps which is uh right right yeah so i don't know it's it's uh no longer so that's what i think it's still based on the old model of and and now they don't uh a lifelong job security telephone pioneers of America all that stuff huh yeah yeah but the the no no longer i don't think so right uh hearing a lot there's always they're always laying people off which is another benefit that you that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security oh does is it i mean does it they must have pretty good severance though huh ah i don't know we don't we haven't been doing layoffs we've been doing uh down sizing with uh getting rid of extra layers of management and uh i don't know what they do for those people i mean the the the management they get rid of some of it yeah there's too many managers too many chiefs and not enough Indians but um oh they they put  so do you do any well it's kind of i do when i don't uh i go i go in spurts unfortunately i can't get as as regular and dedicated as as i probably should yeah yeah well it's it's hard to get uh it's hard to maintain a a real level of uh i don't know what you'd call it i guess motivation at least for me it is i mean where where you where you are you'd probably have to you know the weather probably doesn't cooperate with you you so you would have to belong to a gym or something and yeah i actually i lift weights pretty regular now and i've done it for the last oh i don't know ten twelve years so it works pretty well for me but still it's like you say the motivation is not always there especially in the cold weather yeah yeah and i'm not real used to the cold up here anyway just because i'm from Florida really oh gosh that was a shock i bet so yeah a bit a bit so uh but i don't know it's it's good to get it you get that good feeling you know when you get done and and you're glad you did it i guess but um well growing up i was always um fairly athletic and always um you know i didn't really have to think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise right sure but um i've been in a job lately where i've been working some really long hours and some nights and weekends and uh-huh that makes it rough because then it makes you you lose every bit of muscle tone you ever thought about having and then to try to work your way back from that is is why i can't really get sure yeah that's i'll start up and i'll do pretty religiously and then i'll have to work till midnight one night or something and then you know right and that just screws up your whole schedule oops are you there oh i don't know what that was yeah oh wow you're sounding a lot clearer now i think there's some wrong with the phone or something i think sometimes when they connect it up it it doesn't work right or or something's not exactly right oh yeah that's pretty weird um but yeah i i don't know i i do a lot of stuff or i at least i have in the past done a lot of weird a lot of different activities um and moving down here is is in a way kind of or moving up here is pretty bad because i can't do as much as i used to because the weather just doesn't permit it you know so yeah sure i mean like if your favorite thing is swimming you'd have to join a you know a some club that has a pool and then you have to fight the crowds and that sort of thing exactly and and it is you know i mean exactly it's just a hassle at time everybody i know that belongs to a health club here in Dallas the better ones are always crowded at the times when you'd be more sure you know more likely to use it like right after work or sure everybody gets off of work you know during lunch hours or you know right before work and that sort of thing so people end up exercising at really odd hours and i can't exercise you know late at night because it keeps me awake right um-hum sure oh yeah i mean you know once you you know i've got i bought myself a one of these little um they call it a cross trainer or something like that it's got um kind of like a Soloflex or something yeah it's got uh and it's got a stair climber and it's got the the kind of bench and you can do the leg lifting things and the the bench press thing and it's got a butterfly thing and um-hum oh that's good you know it's got a lot of different stuff on it and i mainly got it because you know like i say since i've gotten so out of shape and everything i forget and i'll do something yeah not thinking about that i don't have the muscle to do it anymore and i injured my rotator cuff on one arm really badly and the doctor was kind of like well you know you're gonna have to uh right uh oh learn to take it easy get some yeah get some build up some muscle tone in in your upper arms or it's gonna always be a problem and it might have to be operated on and you know all this kind of stuff so right you know i i got this machine to try to because i i one thing i did kind of keep up doing was i like to walk uh-huh and i like to ride my bicycle so when the weather's okay you know i can do that but um you know having to sure do something for the shoulder or the arm or something i i had to get a machine to do that and so i have it in my house because i know if i had to get home from work change clothes and go somewhere to a club i just wouldn't do it right uh-huh right yeah it it'd be too much of a hassle and when when you're working really hard and you come in the door you don't wanna turn around and go back out again i mean i have enough trouble you know just doing i do a lot of volunteer work and yeah oh you do and some stuff like that it it's all i can do just to force myself to turn around and go back out and do that kind of stuff uh-huh so you know yeah it when i'm living in Florida i'm i'm an intern up here at Honeywell and when i live in Florida it's it's a lot easy you know it's it everything's nice out and my parents live down there now and my dad's been getting into roller blading lately he roller blades all around the i don't know if that's popular where you're at it  well what kind of requirements do you think you'll you'll want for your next car well uh the the one we bought most recently and and i think that's a good guard because uh we uh we had requirements our requirements change we we now have two kids and so we need a little bit more room um the the one that we bought in in eighty eight uh was a response to the the first child being born and and for that we wanted something really dependable something with an excellent repair record uh something that we were not going have it in the shop a lot um-hum and of all the things that of all the ones that we looked at uh we looked in Consumer Reports and and asked around friends and and looked at our own experiences we went with a a Toyota uh-huh uh we got a Toyota Corolla one of the the wagon kind so it's not as big as the the nineteen fifties uh suburban tank uh-huh um-hum but it's it's spacious enough for for now we now we have two kids uh we've got to put two you know you got enough room for two car seats and and that sort of thing um uh-huh and the repair record has been really terrific um it's been very very nice so i think that um based on our own experience and how satisfied and and we know what sort of driving um requirements we have we we probably would go with that again it the repair record is is for us repair record and the gas and the gas mileage is what drives it for us uh not whether it has a moon roof or uh how many CD players you can stack in it but um-hum oh yeah but the the repair record is is the thing for us well i i have a Nissan that's what i bought and i i guess i originally bought it because of first of all because of the price because when i bought it i want you know i wanted something more you know most enough as much bang for the buck um-hum and i bought the car and i bought the car used and i had almost sixty there's almost sixty thousand miles on it and i have almost a hundred and ten thousand right now wow and since i've had the car i've bought a new battery i've i had a a fan belt pulley go out and the universals in the drive shaft hm but other than that i haven't had any problems with it i when i bought it i went down to Sears and had them put four Sears Road Handlers on it and they've been on there for i guess almost forty seven thousand miles that's good yeah and they look visually they look brand new and it was i guess two months ago well i i changed my the main thing is is the maintenance as you say and i do that i keep the oil changed with the high RPM motors little you know and yeah i get took it to get it tuned up and when i first got it i took it i wanted the valves adjusted and i the guy went in and i had to pay for it the guy says you don't need them adjusted they're fine and so i waited another forty thousand miles and they just adjusted them but they really weren't out of adjustment he they looked at it and he goes it looks like a brand new motor it's because i keep the oil changed and i says well i i wanted brakes changed and he said he looked at them and he says in the back you have three fourths of your pads and in the front they're three fourths you don't need them and i so i've been driving all these miles and i didn't need them but i i changed the front i had the brakes done in the front anyway just because i wanted the front wheels you know packed the the bearings packed and things and it worked out so i mean i i'm just amazed at the performance and i the Japanese cars it just seems that as far as the well i just going interject real quick as a my next purchase i want something with a little more safety features i want the air bags and the antilock brakes that's that's something that i want oh yeah yeah but um i was going to interject say is that when General Motors they sell their car and there's too much of a i i believe there's just too much of a profit margin and you they're you're not getting the car you're you're you're paying for you might say markup where the Japanese cars you you're paying but you you you're getting that performance and so that's i i said i said i'm i'm very very satisfied with my car in fact i it's a you know it's a little little Nissan pickup truck it's five speed i just don't it's i'm i'm not really that tall and it you know it sits me comfortable i have good visibility i mean it just it just a blast it handles like a little sports car just really satisfied with it i i know it it it almost seems a shame that of the the approach perhaps that that uh Detroit takes is that if we're going to make an economy car by God you're going to know it's an economy car uh-huh whereas i get the feeling  okay okay well Mark our situation is that we do have a daughter that is uh in the situation of choosing college she's actually at Bible College for this current year um-hum um-hum and uh i guess uh first and foremost it really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then uh uh which colleges or universities can best offer that program and then it comes down to the dollar you have to uh it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction or you know it does it comes down to uh trying to come with a trade off of the costs um-hum um-hum um-hum uh what do you feel about come of the things that need to damn it i agree with pretty much with everything you've said um the one the one thing that i you know i'd advise any parent um you know or any or any person looking for a college um is that i think i think you know it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from you know the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the you know actual students there because you know they're just um in my experience i've talked to people at other colleges um that you know the the the way the you know the the the lifestyle pictured in the catalogs catalogs isn't always the whole story no you the the college the the catalogs are sales material it doesn't matter whether you know they're they're selling school and uh and true it uh really is helpful if a um-hum um-hum um-hum parent and the student can get there and see um-hum the real character of the school and the real life experiences of the school uh i guess there's a difference in here the the at least the university here in Saskatoon is primarily uh off campus resident students like they just live in the community um-hum uh you know i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is uh is right on campus as well and that you know that changes the character of it quite a bit um-hum um-hum yeah i i go to Georgia Tech which is you know primarily an engineering school and uh you know i think i really do miss the fact you know that it's not a university that there's there's not um-hum the the you know it tends to be a very conservative school and there and there doesn't tend to be the diversity of views that a lot of you know universities will will have yeah uh i guess we're here this is the university that has for years had the the car that uh will travel the farthest on uh on a small quantity of gas our engineering students um-hum uh in competitions and that's the kind of thing that also you see uh if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates can give you idea of the character of the school uh whether you you know in one sense whether you've got a spirit of innovation and excellence or whether you've got a um-hum uh you know it's sort of somewhat unkind but producing graduates um you know as sort of um-hum yeah some development and some training uh like it's easy enough to crank out graduates but to really challenge them um-hum and uh and that can vary between colleges and faculties even as to how you know what the attitude towards achievement is um-hum uh do you uh have anyone that you're seriously needing to uh feed information to i suppose if you're actually at at Georgia Tech as a student you're a ways away from that yeah uh i don't really know of anyone that's like looking that's looking for colleges now you know because with the exception of uh people's younger brothers and sisters then the only advise passed down is don't go to Georgia Tech uh but uh no actually actually i'm i'm i'm more interested in in in choosing the right job job when you graduate type information right well that's that's one of the really a valid point that people need to consider as well um-hum um-hum uh you know to going to college university is going to take four to eight years depending on the programs programs programs person's involved in and after that you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself program um-hum um-hum and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market jeez the best um-hum like a fine arts education i right best training in the world is not going to feed put food on your table um-hum and uh  so what do you think about uh the recycling programs in Atlanta Julie i don't believe that we're the recycling program here is just terrible i mean it's hard to find places to go i mean Kroger does a couple things they i don't think they do they do newspapers i don't know there's there's big bins out there i don't know if they ever get i i really don't know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you but i think there should be some kind of curbside service that's the only way i could really yeah the one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff uh-huh they pick up everything during the summers like the around where i live the uh homeless people seem i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and they'll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them up and then they'd come around and we'd give them to them um-hum um-hum um-hum but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so yeah i don't do that anymore and the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that um outside the uh student center um-hum they never empty those things i know it i know it it piles up they just overflow so what's a guy to do you know i just don't know i asked myself i just don't know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven o'clock you got to pay to park at the student center you can't really unload all your stuff really huh well i you know it's true hadn't thought about that that is very unconvenient inconvenient even i know it i know but uh so you do recycle don't you oh yeah yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of bad about it the but if i if see a if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something um-hum i'll throw it in there but i don't really i don't ever take anything well i mean it's really you ought to because the the the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything uh-huh and since we go there all the time i mean probably be at all but wait i've never seen you before who are you oh by the way my name is Julie yeah my name's Bill well hi hi i'm from Atlanta me too neat crazy um well is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie i just think that everybody ought to do it do they do like what what about like um what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs really yeah what about like those grocery bags oh yeah they have uh uh what i what i used to uh now that i don't go to the grocery store much it's kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time uh-huh and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over uh-huh and but also most places i think like Big Star does and i'm not sure if Kroger does or not but they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in aha can bring them in those petroleum products are gonna kill us i know it i know it it's hostile planet i think Julie it it really is a small hostile planet the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh you know did you know that the great Satan of the recycling no really not did you know that like something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper filled with paper hm paper just seems so innocuous huh paper doesn't seem threatening at all you know well it is it is though it comes from trees how can it be bad it is because they they treat it with chemicals or something why can't trees break down i don't get it well they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper you know yep takes something like twenty times as long to decompose you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper an it will still be there in a couple of weeks oh really yeah it'll be whole huh you'll be able to read off of it i'm gonna switch from those yellow legal pads then um hum i'm glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work and uh but i can just forget that from now on i'm going to use i'm going to switch to the white ones well white paper's bad too they they treat it too well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bamboo you know bamboo stuff from the i'm sure that's fine i'm sure from the banks of the Nile maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again you think so maybe tablets yeah i think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether you think i don't know well i mean no what do you think i think we've kind of you know i mean everybody everybody kind of radical i know but if everybody had a computer we would no longer need paper at all that's true if everyone had a two-way wrist watch TV's on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy i would love that  oh have you ever thought about joining the Peace Corps uh for not for any longer than about ten seconds yeah was that was pretty much my thought too no i have no i have no real desire to do that i i've i've i've actually i've talked to people that uh have have joined the Peace Corps and uh the idea of like you know spending spending like two years in a village in Uganda is you know teaching people how to like you know plow a straight furrow is just not my idea of something i want to do with my life yeah yeah i don't doesn't appeal to me either where i work uh there's a guy who actually joined the Peace Corps he worked here for a couple years and then he went to Ghana uh-huh in Africa and uh what did he say about it well he hasn't come back yet oh you mean he he i he did this just recently yeah he went just recently i you know i i thought that joining the Peace Corps was something that everybody did like in the sixties you know in well there's yeah but there's actually been a resurgence of people getting into it i guess part partly for economic times uh-huh and uh i don't know any other reason but lot of people are been getting back into it i think i yeah i i i talked to i was talking to somebody uh the other day and they they said i think they went they were in the Peace Corps and they ended up going to like Central America or something and uh um-hum they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face in like you know seventy five years uh-huh and uh they had to go on the it's like they had typical it it's the typical third world story you know they they had to every every once a week they had to get on the bus and then like drive up into and take drive up into the mountains and stop at each village you know and and have like give lectures on like public health and stuff uh-huh you know it's like don't piss in the wells that that type of stuff and uh he said that they would get on the bus uh-huh and it's like the children would come up and like touch him because you know they had never seen somebody that light you know a gringo and that it was it was pretty it was really pretty strange sure i it was it would seem to me like if joining the Peace Corps is like you know going to another signing up to go to another planet you know yeah yeah i don't i'm not sure i mean i guess the motivation is partly you want to help these people but i think it's a lot of people join it just to go to another country and kind of for the adventure of it i guess i would really be afraid of i i don't know when i i went to school i i uh i took a course in Parasitology and stuff like that i would really be afraid of like you know of all the diseases and stuff that i could catch and like and man it it seems like a hell of a way to lose weight um oh yeah yeah seems a little rough for that you know oh i don't know but uh i don't know i kind of you know i don't mind going to Europe you know traveling and seeing the sights but i don't want to have to go to Africa to uh-huh i no the maybe they they'll they'll fly you over there and back for free but doesn't seem worth it no it it doesn't seem like the kind of job that i i'd really be interested i'm really interested in either what type of work do you do now oh i'm a i'm an engineer yeah okay for who do you work for you work for uh uh Lockheed oh really i didn't know they had an office up there yeah uh we uh they have a we work for some uh Lockheed Sanders we we don't build the aircraft per se we work on the uh like the avionics yeah we work we put the Sanders avionics okay yeah i've heard of Sanders Corporation were they bought out by Lockheed and all of that okay yeah yeah they they were bought out by Lockheed and it's a they were they were involved like in in radars and thing and uh and things like that right that's that's kind of the work that i do so that's why i've heard of Sanders i work for i work for Georgia Tech uh-huh who do you work for oh okay uh-huh in research yeah we it it's it's not bad it's not bad work although i'll tell you it's like uh i being in the defense industry is not is not really the thing to to be in right now right that's right it it's sort of like being in steel like ten years ago yeah you're just kind of biding your time right you you know that uh i was just talking to somebody about this the other day is that uh i i haven't seen a a a new hire uh somebody you know just fresh out of college brought into the company in like a year and a half uh-huh and uh what's happening is that you know we're just like kind of getting grayer and grayer and grayer you know the the there's no growth here yeah uh-huh yeah it we're essentially the same although some some laboratories are hiring if if they can find new technology uh you know or make an efforts to get into the commercial markets um-hum so we're kind of getting smaller through attrition but there in some cases we're hiring also yeah this the this attrition thing though i that that that's like death itself in my mind  hi so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have uh actually no because because i'm in school i i kind of miss out on most of the current events i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it do you watch a lot of TV to get the news then uh i i don't watch a lot of it but that's the only basically that's my only major source of information um what about what about you well i read um i get a bunch of different things i get a newspaper every day and i try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that and i look through uh i get a Newsweek every week which i i pretty much read that cover to cover and i as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news i get uh don't watch much TV don't have enough time and uh don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened and that's about all i ever hear of it yeah uh but most of my news probably comes from Newsweek and for the longer term i i read um like Scientific American and and uh Reader's Digest and some of those other types of magazines uh that come out which they the news isn't like immediate what you'd generally think of as news but it's recent material and it's more in depth yeah it's it's more in depth less broad well actually it's probably isn't less broad but it's just more in depth and uh it's it's more significant it's more just significant information you know it's the big events not the little events yeah not the fact that there was a big auto accident down at the corner of Broad and Main you know i know it when they're just trying to fill in yes or they're making making time because they have to fill in an hour's worth of news yeah um i get kind of bored watching TV actually when i watch the news on TV because i know i do i do too it goes so slow and then there's nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting yeah you may find one little uh news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it yeah that that's about what it ends up being listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something yeah actually you you mention Newsweek i i i do like uh US News and World Report i don't get to read it as much as i like but that's i think that's a good magazine yeah i think they're about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind yeah and uh uh what what kind of um what kind of news normally interests you i mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring oh well right now i'm trying to keep abreast of uh what's going on in Europe you know with all the uh USSR's satellites breaking off and trying to become independent and then you know European community coming together um-hum that's gonna affect our uh economy quite a bit i think it will um they they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence but we've yet to see it it's real short term yet though i mean it's only been three months or something like that since that happened so oh yeah definitely yeah but they like to tell us that it's going to be important i'm i'm pretty sure it is because uh i think it is too once once Europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy we're gonna be uh kind of hurting yeah i i think that's a possibility um it we might also be helped though because it it'll be easier to do business over there too yeah definitely for the companies that already have a presence over there and uh i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety two so that they would have it when it came time oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold yep because once you're in there then you can easily expand but getting in after nineteen ninety two is more difficult yeah because when they first start off they're going to be highly protectionist so yes yeah and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves they're being somewhat protectionist you know yeah like England doesn't want to do one thing and and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet uh-huh and some of it i mean is i'm sure within those people's minds it's quite justified yeah i i can understand their viewpoint they're just they're starting off and their economy's a little bit weak so they want to get established before they um-hum before they open up their borders to everyone compete yeah totally um what is the um do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that actually i'm not really into sports my roommates are so unfortunately i am forced to watch quite a bit of sports against your will yeah we have to fight over the remote control yeah at least you guys have a remote control it's sometimes better to not have one of those course you can always mislocate it or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it and  well we just had a uh family reunion last summer as it turns out uh oh did you and uh the way it usually works is my father's father all of his children which is all my aunts and uncles uh have traditionally had this rotating schedule sort of thing um-hum and uh would go to one of the brothers and sisters or my aunts and uncles or my father and they'd plan it and go somewhere exotic and invite all the cousins and so that's kind of the framework that we've been working under uh-huh well ours is similar to that although it does not fall on anybody in particular uh of course back when my grandparents were alive they always did it and then it seems like our parents kind of let it slide so um-hum cousins myself and my cousins have started taking this up recently and we've had one oh a few years ago and what we did was uh since we didn't weren't sure of all the addresses and what have you that we started sending out flyers a year beforehand and uh so a pretty big adventure there yes you know trying to see who knew where who else lived and what have you and also gave them a little questionnaire to fill out as to what would be the most convenient time we gave them a couple of choices there uh time and place whether they would like to go back to our quote old hometown or someplace in between for all of us so so how many generations were you trying to round up was this just like from your grandparents on down or we you trying to get second and third cousins and yes uh-huh yes just you know anybody that was in the family mostly cousins second cousins and what have you and their families and anybody that um-hum you know wanted to we wound up going to um since i was i was born in Arkansas and that's what we considered our hometown we wound up going to Biloxi Mississippi um-hum and we uh of course called ahead and got reservations for everyone and uh it turned out real well because the children then had a swimming pool and what have you and it gave us a chance to get reacquainted without all the burden falling on somebody else that sounds like a good way to do it because what happens with with our system is you know the the family who's turns it comes and and they come every oh let's see every two years every three years something like that uh-huh um generally finds themselves really doing a lot of organization you know they wherever they decide to go they're responsible for deciding what games that are going to be played and what food the and who's going to bring what and uh-huh they don't bring everything but just making the assignments and everything turns out to be kind of a chore yes it i and uh was my family's shot just this last summer and uh my sister ended up doing most of the work and uh we've decided all the all the my brothers and sisters are pretty much grown up now we're all married we all have our own kids and it's kind of looking like this business of getting all the other cousins my cousins together is just um-hum uh-huh not really working out so well uh-huh well that could be because my children are are now have cousins of their own that they'd rather get with and and so i think what's going to happen in the future is it will be from my father on down and and all of his descendants and and those those cousins so uh-huh um-hum we're we're kind of dissipating as we get bigger and bigger here well we have a pretty small family anyway so uh we're only sixty two you know with our cousins and so forth and like my children yeah have no cousins no first cousins well that's kind of sad so it it's like i say our family's dwindling here that's yeah well my dad's one of about eight children and i'm one of nine and uh all of my aunts and uncles all have lots of kids so we had lots of cousins by the time you get all of them and their kids together it's oh i bet it's a big undertaking you know we have to find a a big substantially large place just to get everything set up um-hum and uh what we did this last summer is my sister used to work for uh uh kind of uh a canyon retreat for uh uh disabled children right uh-huh um-hum and uh since she was an employee she knew what the schedule was and knew when it'd be free signed up and and reserved and paid for the place so so we could all show up and it was nice you know there're several cabins there swimming pool and horses and all that and it and we filled the place up um-hum yeah well that's that's good that's well like i say it uh we have been talking about again this well another cousin and i that seem to want to do this all the time that um we've been talking about getting together for another one because it has been quite a few years now and we'll probably go the same route that we did before because we had a good response back back to Mississippi well i don't know we're going give them another choice  a uh Golden Retriever ooh that's one of my favorite kinds of dogs how long have you had it yeah is it really we've had him for let's see he just had his fourth birthday fourth birthday yeah and we got him when he was about eight weeks old and uh he's pretty okay we like him does he shed a lot he does that's the one thing we don't like about him in fact we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that how much does he weigh now he actually he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything and they put him on the scale and he's up to ninety four now oh but he's not a real he's not a real tall uh dog for a Golden Retriever he's kind of stocky shorter and stockier hm is he good with family he is it's uh just me and my wife and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i guess we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten yeah i can understand that because i you can get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids how about you um-hum well we have a cat who's also about four years old and he's our spoiled child right now too and he also sheds a lot uh uh-huh yeah but we uh we hope to get a Golden Retriever someday but we figure we'll get the kids and then the the dog that's probably a good idea they're good though uh have you ever had a Retriever before no but my husband had one when he was growing up because i i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial they like to play hm and especially with kids they love to play with kids in is is your dog an inside and outdoor no he's pretty much an inside dog hm he stays in we we're kind of in a not a real busy neighborhood but more so than i'd want him to be out too much and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside he's he's really a wimp oh really and when it comes to being alone uh now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants he likes that but he does not like to be tied outside he'll he'll just bark and bark and bark huh when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back or no he's uh taken to the training pretty well and uh he knows where our yard is and we have a pretty small yard but he seems to know the boundaries hm and he usually is good about staying within them although our next door neighbors have a dog too and uh she she is good friends with my dog oh yeah and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff but he's pretty good he stays out of the street and uh if i catch him i call him and he comes back so he he's pretty good about taking to commands and things hm did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own and no we never did i i trained him on my own and uh this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult uh-huh we've had kids or we've had dogs when i was a kid but this this is the first one that i uh took in so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time but uh he he seems to have picked it up pretty well i never really had to hit him or anything just you know firm tone of voice uh-huh huh amazing and those sorts of things i i see other people out there and they hit their dogs and try to and and those horrible collars that they put on them with invincible invisible fencing least i think it invisible what invisible fencing have you heard of that no what is that it's uh it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little uh transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it oh and if they get too close to that perimeter it it zaps them yeah yeah huh boy i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog yeah well a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to so he held on to the collar and he walked out to the perimeter he said it was a good jolt oh really yeah so i i don't take too well to to those sorts of training techniques i don't think they're always necessary if you put enough patience into uh hm yeah just be consistent and diligent with it and um-hum it's uh is your cat an indoor cat or an outdoor cat hm yeah he's indoor and all declawed because i know the uh average life span of an outdoor cat is eighteen months and somebody just told me that because of the leukemia yeah yeah that and also just um getting hit i guess or getting beat up and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years wow quite a difference what uh what kind of climate do you have so yeah well um it's we just moved recently so now we're in the um Dallas area and it's very very nice and oh  so uh how do you feel about the taxes you pay do you feel you pay uh too much or about right or well it it it's the type of thing of what exactly am i getting out of the taxes and yeah to some extent there is definitely you know you can say all right i'm paying this money for this and this is what i'm getting back in terms of roads and highways and you know i guess quote unquote retirement if it's actually there when we actually end up retiring yeah it's hard to tell there there seems to be some problem you know some question on whether there will be actually money there or not uh-huh that i don't like about the taxes is i was looking through the IRS forms like uh the other day uh-huh i noticed that fourteen percent of the amount of money that we pay in for taxes each year is just going to pay the national debt um-hum now is that the debt uh or is that just the interest on the debt that that is the interest on the debt yes you know i really don't understand this completely i've been a little mystified who who are we paying it to ourselves okay um to a large extent i mean one of the i think i'm not sure if it's the largest but i know a large segment of the national debt is um you know things like savings bonds and other government obligations okay so it's to private individuals who own government instruments of some sort well not not just private but there's you know lot of public institutions that are holding money as well as a lot of um foreign companies and foreign persons uh-huh that are holding that but okay so but these are nongovernmental entities yeah nongovernmental okay who are holding bonds and whatever yeah you know Treasury Certificates and US Savings Bonds and whatever okay yeah that is uh i mean well what what can they i mean what's to be done at this point increase that amount for sometime so it will eventually go down or i mean i imagine if you're just servicing the debt you're not really making any progress right right well it's actually uh you know also looking at the same form they had that we are borrowing the US is borrowing eighteen percent of the amount of of how how of whatever it's spending every year so we're increasing the debt by an amount equal to eighteen percent of the annual budget yeah so we're borrowing eighteen percent and fourteen percent of what we're paying out is going to pay the eighteen the uh debt so to some extent we're borrowing money to pay so you know fourteen percent that we're borrowing goes directly paying out to the debt which is only increasing yeah so we're you know net we're doing a net borrowing of four percent each year and then we're doing a borrowing on top of that of fourteen percent that just goes to pay interest on the debt right and uh then the question i mean do other countries do this or this a distinctly American phenomenon that i don't know i don't know if uh other countries work as a deficit or not i from what i can understand it's only recent within maybe the last fifty years or so uh-huh you know except for wartimes that the U S has had a peacetime debt uh-huh well and i guess fifty years would pretty much jive with the last big wartime debt yeah and they just seemed like it's a good idea why stop yeah i i think if you look at some of the uh government spending curves um you know the the curve always went up around wartime and then dropped back down uh-huh after World War Two it never dropped back down or it was World War Two or uh Korea i think it never dropped back down uh-huh so what do you think is the uh you know if you were in charge what would you what parts would you change to fix this problem well you know definitely one thing is to say hey we have a year to year balanced budget so at least we wouldn't have that additional uh what was it eighteen percent or yeah yeah so you know you know maybe raise taxes for a few years until that debt gets paid off and then say you know unless there is a uh-huh tremendously bad circumstances like a war or something we should not be running a deficit economy you know that's i mean if you look on the individual level if i were to borrow eighteen percent of what i was spending every year year after year i would very quickly get in trouble with creditors uh-huh well it does seem like the uh the quality of the bonds that United States sell would eventually be downgraded doesn't it um yeah well that's you know the post wartime Germany they just kept printing up money and you know it became worthless so that's one danger uh-huh uh-huh um-hum but you know it's that that's a very large chunk of the money we pay in for taxes each year it is shocking but apparently no one's willing to oh i'm not no one but by the time it all ends up in Congress seems  i don't think anybody pays too little no i would tend to agree very highly i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it do you get hit up for local taxes there yeah we sure do here in Indiana we pay uh we pay county income tax state income tax we pay five percent sales tax uh you name it they tax it oh so you you you get the whole smorgasbord that's right we well i i actually live in New Hampshire uh-huh tax free or die uh-huh right which is probably pretty nice but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high no actually there's no sales tax in New Hampshire either there's no sales tax either no what there is is very high property taxes because that's how they fund schools and everything uh-huh the only problem is i work in Massachusetts so they they hit me up for the five percent there right Taxachusetts yep but it well you know we it's it's only a state taxes no local we've got a five percent sales tax uh-huh right but um the problem is that so i'm paying state tax even though i don't live here but at least on things like stock options and things like that they don't tax me right uh-huh so that's not too bad no i uh i really think that here in Indiana at least we pay a a whole uh just too much tax i worked in a factory uh last summer and on the average i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that i mean i don't utilize all you know it really any government welfare services of course i drive on the roads and i you know went to the schools and stuff but i really feel that that i'm just getting overtaxed yeah oh i i i mean i i'd consider twenty percent lucky because just on i mean you know when you figure out just on feds you know i actually hit the thirty one bracket this year which was no fun uh-huh no that's that's not any fun right and also you know then you figure out seven or eight percent for FICA uh-huh which is taxes where you most people forget about them because you've got you know you can't always get your FICA back at the end of the year but so you know and then you know like a five percent FICA i'm paying forty percent tax right right yeah which is just outrageous and a lot of it and if you look at the way the government is run these days it just seems like a lot of its going to waste yeah well i i mean i think there's some people there you there clearly are some things where you need infrastructure and you need right you know you know there are things government does better you know i think government does a better space program right than you're gonna get out of private individuals but you know i think you know you look at things like you know tax subsidies to tobacco farmers because Jesse Helms wants it that way or right that's right got to keep those farmers happy you know and and just tremendous amounts of you know so much of it is now just going to service debt or you know is going in uh-huh into into programs that you know yeah they are they are fat you know i think the military is really fat i think that a lot of the the HEW services although they're providing necessary services have too much fat in them right there is there is just way too much bureaucracy and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running keep the paper shuffling around instead of real you know good programs you know like we we um yeah i mean we we spend a fortune for things like VA hospitals and you know then you look at how well they're managed you know i don't think we're getting our money's work out worth out of there i think it's all going into into bureaucrats right and a lot of it's feeding uh just i just i really especially in the election year i mean i'm really thinking a lot about this the economy and questions like that and and just the whole it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as the economy of the government goes and our our whole economy in general and our taxes just are gonna keep rising no matter what happens and especially when you've got the Bush administration who has increased government and expenditures uh beyond beyond what any other President since World War Two has done and yet he supposedly well between between between him and Reagan yeah right right yeah i mean i just read something that two thirds or three quarters i'm not exactly sure of our national debt the great communicator are was created during the Reagan Bush era who are supposedly supposedly fiscally conservative oh oh yeah they think oh yeah and then they go and say that Congress Congress they're the fault for it right but you know the other thing is it's tricky though because like in New Hampshire they say oh all right let's cut the military budget well yeah then you lose half your jobs in New Hampshire you lose Grotten Connecticut goes so you know it's like right um-hum you know it's very tricky to balance that stuff off because then you hurt you know if the if the if people lose their jobs then they become a load and they're not contributing taxes that's right so you know it's it's very hard to say you know this is what we should cut yeah it's really that is the especially that defense cuts in the defense is really a catch-22 yes double whammy because like you say if you cut defense well that's great that's gonna lower our national expenditures but then you're gonna have people on welfare and they're not putting taxes in who who aren't contributing right yeah so that's that's really and uh in our it's i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these policies right but what's very funny is in our town meeting they were voting this this this guy had both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which unfortunately violates New Hampshire constitution for our local town to do it to uh have you have people line item their taxes uh-huh right they say i want to pay for this and this and this and this and this course the only problem with that is then nobody pays for the necessary services that they don't use that's right yeah  okay um so we're talking about drug testing on and how we feel about it in in in the work place correct i i assume this is involuntary drug testing from employers yeah yeah my my gut feeling is to probably side uh on the the Bill of Rights side of this and say that this it's an unfair invasion of privacy i i um it i have to say that i my from my political point of view i tend to be i tend to sort of fall in the liberal side of a lot of issues but at the same time uh part of my own picture of the way politics should work in this country is there also should be uh regulatory controls on things and i think that when you have situations where uh an uh a working individual uh could do damage for instance a an airline pilot uh you know or or somebody who's driving a public carrier like like truck drivers and stuff like that i think that there is a uh far more substantial issue uh at hand but i think there other ways um other than than doing things like drug testing to monitor the way um people behave um i think a good for instance a good manager should be able to tell that somebody's got a personal problem um in in like a clerical environment or a a work environment like i'm a i'm a computer programmer so if i were indulging in activities like that or one of my colleagues were um it would seem to me pretty easy to to tell if their performance was suffering for it i don't know how do you feel about these things right well i i i i tend to look at it like uh right i mean without without uh you know a suspicion of of you know reasonable suspicion of of something going on i i would have to probably tend to uh uh agree that at least in most cases it should not be done i i also my my big question of course is you know this is a pretty steep thing for uh something the last i heard was not a hundred percent effective um-hum or you know accurate uh with it not being a hundred percent accurate that that leaves open you know quite a bit of room for you know false positive um-hum sure sure and that could ruin somebody's life uh absolutely you know that that even if they were vindicated sure sure because i mean it's like uh someone goes on trial for something the press lets everybody know so no matter how many times you're acquitted but uh so there is that i mean but also you know as as someone who does not use any controlled substances i you know part of me says well as long as it's accurate i don't care if they test and if someone is using it they should be you know caught for it as long as it's illegal sure uh so that you know that that is a tough things to juggle between the two um-hum uh well i have to say i'm i'm a child of the sixties and uh it it you know i grew up and when i was young i flirted around with some of that stuff like a lot of my friends did and i saw a lot of my friends ruin their lives or not not really i don't know i guess i saw a couple of friends ruin their lives and that sort of thing but i didn't see most of them ruin their lives with it in fact most of them went through it like a phase like you know most teenagers will drink for a little while and then when they you know have to start you know working and that sort of thing they tend to cut it back to drinking on the weekends or whatever and and they become adults about it and uh in in fact my attitudes about the kinds of drug problems that we have in this country uh are are that i think that the government should administrate administrate it in a completely you know in a completely different manner i think it would be a a good source of revenue i think there's some some evidence about the way this stuff has been handled in Europe that shows that it can be controlled in different ways but that's sort of moving off the topic at hand here and i you know the the fact of the matter is is i think that issues like this really really are i mean to a certain extent they involve the whole question of liberty and a person's right to privacy and that sort of thing because uh uh you know i mean it also involves due process yeah and and uh it it i you know the fact of the matter is is i think that that an adult responsible worker doesn't want to have this kind of thing in his life if it's going to impact uh have an impact upon his ability to make a a a living and and you know and and keep his livelihood coming in and and that does bring up a good point in that if it's not having an impact then what right does the uh employer have to you know to get information about that sure and and and uh and and so you know it's uh i so anyway i guess that we're we're largely in agreement in that uh case and uh and in fact i think that uh because you know i mean i it's it's literally i you know i'm in my late thirties now and it's easily been um almost jeez man maybe twenty years almost since i last had any of that that sort of stuff uh around me but at the same time i don't think that that necessarily gives me a right to say  okay well why did your roommate get a dog i really don't know he kind of moved out entirely and um was living with his girlfriend in this apartment and they had gone ahead and gotten this Rottweiler puppy and next thing i knew well he went ahead and kept uh the room here kept paying for it after he graduated and next thing i knew they had kicked the Rottweiler out so he came back home with it oh we've got a big yard here and he can run around out there but he's pretty rough i'm getting a lot of scars on my hands oh that's good arms and stuff well is he teething yeah and it's it's getting kind of rough in fact he'll even chew on your face if you make the right kind of noise yeah oh yuck oh yuck well i have a um i have a well i call her my a puppy but she's actually going to ten and uh had her all ten years and she she'll rough house with you but she's she's learned very quickly when enough is enough um-hum but she loves to play and stuff but i don't know she's she's i'm getting ready to i'm fixing to move out in on my own yeah and she's going with me and i mean that's i i'm thinking that she's going to be one of my main sources of of companionship in in the beginning do you um think about her as defensive kind of maybe tool or something you mean a as far as protection house protection nah protecting you and the house oh no no no she had a stroke about two years ago she's blind uh so no no she she's strictly the lovable type um-hum so no she's she's too little to do that i live downtown and the neighborhood's pretty and i like the um the idea of having a a good mean strong dog around we've had some in the past and it's really paid off i so this is this is not your first experience with with a dog no no we've had two other ones here at this house and the last one was well the guy said it was half wolf and it really had that look yellow eyes it was very intelligent but there was man if it got the chance it wouldn't leave anything alive in the area whoa cats and squirrels and stuff like that i can remember going for a jog one day with it and it got hold of a baby squirrel oh and you know there really wasn't a whole lot that could be done other than let it go ahead and finish it off at that point um um well uh let's see a lot of the uh i don't know if you've i've i've been i've heard about a lot of studies and stuff and they said that um people that have pets have a lower incidence of um heart disease and stuff like that yeah i believe that and i believe it yeah you take out all your aggressions on the dog and plus having something to care for and somebody that cares for you yeah yeah they're they're good companions absolutely it's a lot better than coming home to an empty house yeah what what do they call that unconditional um so uh that kind of love where there's just no expectations or anything like that oh yeah yeah i i know what you're talking about yeah totally undevoted totally devoted uh yeah totally i mean because i mean they know no other no other kind yeah i used to have a chicken i only had it for a few months though and one of the dogs around here got a hold of it a chicken and see the when i moved in here the neighbors had chickens and even though this is downtown they had a rooster over there and it woke me up every morning a little bit after sunrise and my uncle found this chicken in his neighborhood and one night when it roosted nearby he went ahead and grabbed it and asked if i wanted it and brought it on over Ethel a little black bantam Ethel that's cute did did she do eggs i mean did you did you did she lay eggs and stuff uh she didn't hang around long enough tried trimming her wings but she kept getting out oh oh yeah yeah i'm not really sure what happened to her gosh yeah the chicken that got loose in the city yeah so we had a cat recently too but it decided that it just didn't like staying inside all the time it kept wanting out so i'd go ahead and let it out and it got till it got more and more feral um-hum um-hum and next thing i knew man it'd gotten till it really smelled of the outside um-hum it had found some horrible smell that it liked and when it would come in you couldn't couldn't stand being near it and one day it went ahead and marked the couches in the living room at that point i went ahead and banished it and that was it no more cat well is is is your Rottweiler mainly an indoor dog or an outdoor dog well we're trying to get her to be more and more of an outdoor dog right now she's indoors she's still a puppy and needs a lot of social interaction right so you come home and she's dying to come in barks at night howls lonely um-hum so we go and let her in um-hum well and that's it was i know growing up i had i had several dogs that were outside yeah and Pooh Bear is inside is an inside dog but and and i found that it's so much easier to socialize with her because she's inside and i can do other things with her there yeah whereas i don't have to go outside to play with her you know what i'm saying yeah so i think it's i don't know i  you have any pets yes do you have do i have pets yes i have a cat and i have two dogs yeah two dogs what kind i have a Schnauzer and i have a Sheltie Schnauzers is it a miniature or a standard Schnauzer it it's a miniature um-hum hm uh i'm going into all this because i used to work i just got done working at a pet shop actually oh okay well the Schnauzer i'm i'm watching for one of uh the managers where i work and he's been transferred to Germany for a while yeah uh and i'm taking care of his dog and uh and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that and he says well my dog doesn't like cats and i said well we won't tell him it's a cat we won't tell her it's a cat because it was a kitten and you know they just they just love kittens they just are fascinated yeah oh yeah so she doesn't know that this is a cat yet and they get along real good i said if Tom could see his dog lick this kitty he'd flip so that was interesting that's good they say didn't expect that would happen yeah that's cool that's nice um let's see what was the other dog you had it's a Sheltie she's real sweet sweet little dog she's got a very nice temperament uh they're not as aggressive as a Schnauzer you know the Schnauzers are a little aggressive oh a Sheltie yeah they can be nippy um-hum yeah Shelties are nice everybody seems to be really happy with them they're good temperament they're a good temperament and they they put up with a lot and they just uh i think they have a good head on their shoulders i think they have a a higher level of intelligence than other uh dogs that i've encountered Schnauzers in particular probably well yeah but also some poodles uh they're kind of um there are some smart ones out there but there's some also some uh not so smart ones i oh yeah yeah i get it seems the smaller the are the the worse off they are yeah that that's maybe that's there's uh some credence in that statement yeah they're they're bred down so much it's um-hum they aren't the best pets i i'd i really don't know what the best pet is i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal yeah yeah i mean some people seem fairly well suited for for uh miniature poodles and such hm and Bulldogs but i don't know about these uh these um uh these Pinschers these no what are they called Pit Bulls Pit Bulls that are so vicious pit bull oh they're nice they're actually very friendly dogs are they really i don't think i've ever seen one uh they're really nice i i have dealt with quite a few of them people uh customers that bring them into the shop and ask me to like they uh fit collars and stuff on them and they're they're just really nice really friendly um kind of like medium intelligence um well how do they becomes well how did they get their reputation then well because some people um want to train them as oh they train them to be that way then oh okay yeah you really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way yeah it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really respond oh okay oh dear so the the poor animal is doing it in self protection oh dear right yeah they aren't they aren't by nature really nasty critters they are very determined critters and so once you get them going it's not good to um-hum to deal with but they i i really like them i was i was impressed by them they're they're real sturdy little critters and they aren't that big and uh just really friendly um-hum well that's unusual i was huh well i suppose you were surprised i was i was overwhelmed yeah uh right now after the reputation that you know they have quite an uh uh notable reputation as far as you know they picked up a lot of bad press lately yeah they're banned from in some areas i understand um-hum well yeah but any any any pet's gonna can can be bad if you train it to be that way you know that they must have just targeted that breed and said boy we're gonna well yeah it's when in my hometown they just outlawed ferrets oh okay because they had one incident of a ferret uh attacking a kid a child in a house i mean these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret the the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild oh okay uh-huh uh-huh and you know they should expect something like that to happen and so basically now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town uh oh did it attack the child then yeah it it bit him uh-huh and that was that was not a good thing but i think it was probably a an individual ferret thing because it was fairly it was a fairly wild ferret and they hadn't well the the people that owned him should have been on the lookout for that yeah i they really should've should've expected it and taken the precautions they didn't it's too bad it happened though none um sure yeah yeah because then the the the animal's in trouble and not the person right  um so you do you have children no no um i'm single uh my parents are divorced so i can relate to not having enough family time okay um i don't have i'm single um my family moved around a lot and i was at boarding school so i can relate to not having family time um uh-huh oh so uh so what do you think it's important for as far as spending quality time with family well uh my parents didn't have a lot in common and that's that's what really brought on the divorce is just uh growing terribly apart they got married too young and uh uh-huh my dad i never really knew my dad um he was just a man in the house we um he he my parents were together until i was about sixteen yeah um-hum and um i never i i talked to him but it was just in passing you know we spent well the older i got the less time we spent together yeah and um we we talked maybe five minutes out of a week oh okay and so so i loved him and we talked well you know we gave each other other hugs and asked how our day had been and that was the extent of it oh huh everyday you know that would be the most we'd talk about for just a couple of minutes and what about your mom um-hum okay oh well i am very close to my mother uh we talk all the time i live with her now my parents have been divorced for about three years three and a half four years and um um-hum okay and we talk all the time we're very close and she is a real personable relationship oriented woman well that's good that's good um my my parents and i didn't talk while i was growing up so uh they sort of did their thing and i did my thing so um uh-huh uh we they're not divorced but um they're missionaries and their you know their job came first family second it seemed anyway right oh dear so that's the way i saw it so we didn't really spend much family time together i didn't think um and they you know i was in the basketball and track team and they never came to any of that uh-huh oh uh-huh oh so things like that so if if i had a family i'd make sure that i would go to events you know that my kids would be involved in because it's really important sure sure you know to help them to feel like they're special or you know important oh yeah uh-huh yeah i'm a Christian and i know that that God is supposed to be your priority but your family's priority above church work right is is what i've always believed my dad was chairman of the deacons in our church uh-huh uh-huh and he put time with the church church uh uh the church burned by accident um uh the you know when i was real young and we were in the process of building another house uh-huh uh-huh and my dad put working on the church building uh before working with my mother on the house kind of left to her uh-huh and really left the family completely behind to work on the church and to be you know what everybody would consider to be a good leader of the church wanted him to be yeah right right and and he had more of a desire with with with the rest of the church members to be with us and so that that was definitely a problem oh yeah sounds like it and uh when when my parents divorced i i think my mother has trouble staying in church because um she's just she just knows that there's a lot of hypocrites and um uh-huh that you you just have to put that part behind you right there is hypocrites everywhere anytime you have uh a group of people oh sure sure and oh sure and not everybody is going to get along but uh yeah that that was definitely a a problem in the marriage and they didn't communicate well at all so but that's right that's right right since they weren't spending time with each other hardly at all you know my dad would come home late from work because he'd visit everyone in the community before he'd come home um uh-huh right me and my sister i have an older sister six years older than me that Stacy McClain oh my word i i think i know who she is yeah in fact as you were talking i was thinking i know who you are yeah she's in my class in fact she's Karen she's the one that got me into this oh my goodness oh my goodness what is your name again Karen oh my goodness that's funny well then she can tell you all about our family and you sound like her yeah okay well she's told me a little bit but you're you're you're telling me more i'm getting the whole scoop yeah well that's really a coincidence uh-huh yeah oh yeah well i have to tell her because i talked two two nights ago was from Pennsylvania then last night it was New Jersey and i didn't expect someone oh really  okay an English a Siberian husky and an English springer spaniel sprat Siberian husky and a springer spaniel yeah uh those are two very different dogs aren't they yeah they are the springer is a little on the small side is he kind of hyper too or he's sort of very very hyper well this is uh a mutt a mutt of a cat it's a part Siamese it's very vocal uh-huh and uh tabby so um he's orange that must be weird to have a howling tabby you know the of course you have the standard Siamese moaning and groaning and you you don't hear it uh yeah i do now it sounds like a baby doesn't it yeah yeah yeah i don't know it's kind of strange it the body shape looks a lot like a Siamese but it's orange yeah it's uh male he's smaller than most tomcats you see yeah i grew up with two Persians one was eighteen pounds and the other was twenty pounds wow serious cats huge yeah you ask permission yeah they have uh extra digits no well they just were just flat big uh man i've seen some cats with uh you know extra digit on their paw and things like that uh-huh but uh so why do you have pets well we got this uh you know the two dogs one's the Siberian which is a real mellow thing she looks like a wolf but she's just a big baby yeah well why why did you get the the dogs or i had dogs all my life oh okay i've had uh and the Siberian was basically there for the taking if i wanted it as a puppy so i brought the Siberian home and she's just been just great with kids and uh-huh and then my wife wanted a had a cocker when she was younger and when she was a kid and she wanted to have a another spaniel type dog and so we wanted a bigger spaniel because we didn't want a cocker as small as a cocker for the husky to beat up they fight do they fight but the what tooth and nail oh gosh they're not serious except but they're just always at each other yeah how do you know they are not serious what uh you mean they're not serious they draw blood or something you mean yeah right dogs don't normally fight serious very long because normally one as big as a Siberian or as small as a spaniel the spaniel knows its place pretty quickly and that takes care of that um-hum yeah you know it's normally they're at each other just you know snarling and snapping and rolling and thumbing uh-huh and then when they're but when the Siberian's decided that she she's had all that she wants of that hyper spaniel it's it's very clearly stated whack you know there are very clear words spoken in dog and that's the end and the spaniel and the and the springer goes away uh-huh uh that's interesting well this is the only cat i mean i i never had cats when i was young uh-huh uh i had roommates at one point and they had a cat and i lived with that for a couple of years and and i kind of liked it and uh uh-huh and uh my uh at the time was my girlfriend now my fiancee Kia brought a cat out to me when i was leaving alone down Oregon uh-huh when i was living out there and you know i agreed to have the cat and it was it was good company yeah good company a cat would chest as you fall asleep watching TV or something crazy like that yeah so that's why i like them sort of they keep you company and they're kind of interesting to watch sometimes this one's very uh playful he's the for unusual unusual for a cat when he was a lot younger he um used to play catch with me and uh i you throw the i catch but i'd throw the ball the whate ver it was and he'd run after it and bring it back uh yeah that's sort of strange for a cat in terms of um you know whatever happens to be around he'll he'll you know play then he also likes going hunting for well insects like uh solar fish or whatever have you it's pretty funny you know he likes doing that the spaniel is death on crickets really well were in Virginia you live she'll and northern Virginia right over right over the across the river from DC oh okay Arlington or Crystal City well it's called Springfield have you ever driven south on ninety five yeah yeah well you know when you come over the Woodrow Wilson Bridge and you come around  Ted you're from south here you'd have to be interested in music right uh yeah yeah i my interests have varied over the years but uh i've been uh oh for the last uh seven it must be seven years now i've been volunteering at Seattle Opera uh-huh which has been real interesting been working there as a super numerary which is uh a non singing actor oh wow so i'm in all these productions i'm in about three or four a year and it's uh it's really interesting it's really well that should be interesting yeah it's really fun well do you play an instrument yourself well i used to play guitar and sing and about um it's about nine years ago i just kind of stopped i'd done it all my life uh-huh but it's nothing now yeah i listen to music and i'm uh i'm singing actually i just started taking voice lessons but uh i am not playing anymore uh-huh huh that's i play the recorder i'm not oh neat and i really love playing with the guitarist and i do it for i used to play the elbow and the recorder has about the same fingerings as the elbow so i just i had to have my elbow back in junior high so i just kept up with that hum but i really enjoy playing that and then the piano um-hum i'm trying to teach myself that just to keep myself entertained we just bought an old piano that we are trying to refinish uh so that keeps us really busy hum so do you um practice much in the opera or do you have to go to many practices yeah i have to go to a lot of a lot of rehearsals um it's uh i just did three shows in a row i also work with do the same sort of work with Pacific Northwest Ballet um-hum and uh they uh oh i'm in the Nutcracker every year with them at the Seattle Center Opera House now is that volunteer yeah yeah it is in that one i played the grandfather of the main character huh that's really interesting we never got to go we went to the the orchestra up there yeah oh the Seattle Symphony uh-huh the not the symphony what's the other one there's two groups i can't remember their names well the Seattle Symphony is kind of the main one right here there's some small community orchestras around town what's the one that plays with the U like there's Harmonic okay that's the one we went and saw oh i see so that was that was really interesting too are you at work right now no i'm at home oh i heard a it that ringing you heard was a another another line here oh okay yeah i'm also uh kind of interested in uh oh uh a lot of kind of ethnic music and foreign music and stuff uh uh-huh stuff that's marketed under the name of world music um there's this really great band i found uh that's from Britain called Three Mastabas Three who play this guys i first heard them when i i was visiting a friend in New York a few years ago and he played the tape of them and we couldn't figure out where they were from because they were playing this stuff like some of it sounded like Middle Eastern other sound like it was eastern European and uh uh-huh anyway it uh uh it was really uh uh really interesting stuff so i came back here to Seattle and found a CD of theirs and was looking for more recordings of their stuff and uh uh ended up writing a writing them a a fan letter uh yeah asking where i could find uh find more uh more of their uh more of their recordings uh-huh and uh um they uh they wrote back and told me when they were coming to Seattle so i met them when they were here they were were really funny just a moment well that was interesting did you talk to them at all or yeah that was weird i just uh just put my that's weird i just put it on hold and i heard what sounded like a modem on the other line that was calling us up that's very strange is the group um anyway anyway yeah i met them it was it was kind of interesting i'd been wondering for a long time where these guys were from and thinking they might be from eastern Europe and what they confirmed was our suspicion which was they were basically a bunch of crazed British no musicologists ooh ah uh uh they were kind of playing a big joke on the world just a second same thing okay i'm back yeah i never got any instructions with this thing on what you're supposed to do when you get another phone call how do they deal with call waiting you know uh you got you got another phone call from TI no no no no i mean somebody else calls you know so many people have call waiting these days actually we have a completely separate oh okay  okay want to go ahead and start then sure uh recycling in this community has uh been a problem for the past two years i moved down here two years ago from a community that had had recycling band this particular town uh does not offer municipal trash services so we are all uh under obligation to get our own trash hauled away and when i talk to the local trash haulers about recycling they said that uh they could haul it to the recycling site but it would be about twenty dollars a month more so it was uh fairly amazing to me that this thing that they are trying to mandate throughout the state uh was being snubbed in this particular town hum wow do you guys have like recycling bins no for your glass and stuff like that no we don't uh as i said we we are responsible for finding our own trash pick up hum and all the uh trash haulers in this area will take the uh the sorted trash and bring the recyclables to a uh a recycling center but they charge twenty dollars or more a month for that particular service i'll be darned down down here in isn't too much of a tax burden up here down here it's uh they have uh the the garbage company picks it up for us and they what we do is we have to separate this stuff you know papers and and plastic materials and glass um-hum right and uh they'll they'll come by in a separate truck and i guess it's paid for with taxpayer's money right but up there i guess you guys are saving the tax payers uh well uh it it's interesting because this uh the town i live in is a a coastal town that uh during the summer really is a uh a tourist resort type town and uh the population really drops off in the winter so they uh i guess they figure that they wouldn't uh they wouldn't provide that particular service oh i see yeah uh when i when i lived back up uh closer to the city it we had the municipal trash pick up and we sorted the bottles the paper and all of that and uh you know i'd had about a year or so to get used to that whole system and i moved down and i said this is a great you know i like doing this it's not that much of a pain um it sounds good to me what do i do to keep doing this and the answer was you can if you want but it's going to cost you yeah so i i was fairly surprised yeah that's it is surprising but it sounds like you're in uh are you near the ocean and stuff then or yes uh so you are in a nice place well i really do like it here uh i yeah i'm i'm close to the ocean myself i'm in Juno here um-hum and uh it's it's it's pretty nice about uh probably a half mile from the beach i'm not right on it but uh i'm pretty close to right i'm about i'm about uh maybe uh quarter of a mile to a half a mile away yeah that's pretty good that's pretty good but uh the the other thing about recycling that had uh that i've noticed is i've seen a few articles in the paper now that uh there's more recycled material than people know what to do with uh apparently the uh the uh the manufacturer glass people the plastics the paper people the glass people aren't using enough of the recyclables to uh to keep the chain going so there's a a back log of of material that was put in for recycling that no one knows what to do with and it's actually hum was that a uh was that a beverage manufacturer that uh wrote that article i don't know i i've seen it a couple of times and i'm i'm i couldn't cite the source right now um-hum right right well it's true we uh in this state don't have a bottle bill and every time it's raised there is uh that lobby that keeps it down and i it's i i really can't see why people would get that upset about it because once it's in place it doesn't seem all that uh that difficult to manage  all right uh yeah we we spending quite a bit of time on me and my wife spending a lot of time with our kid we do a lot of games and stuff with him uh okay how many kids do you have just one okay must make it nice to be able to have two of you and one one child oh yeah and uh we you know we take turns taking him back and forth taking him to day care and stuff so okay he gets both of us right and in our case we have uh two children that are a little bit older than that one of them yeah being a teenager wants to take care of himself more than he wants us to take care of him but uh i do believe that it's it's nice to have opportunities to have the whole family together oh yeah it's and uh it's pretty nice for us you know a lot of times we just sit out front and watch him ride his bicycle and stuff like that those memories can be really nice i guess uh especially looking back toward them i have several memories like that and that was brought home even more distinctly about two weeks ago when a a very good well a a good friend's uh daughter age fifteen was killed in an automobile accident oh suddenly hm yeah that's when you look back and think oh my goodness yeah what could i have done to change you know something right or uh be glad that uh be glad count the blessings that you receive every once and awhile and don't take it for granted yeah uh yep that's for sure i can understand that part oh what sort of do you do activities as a family go out and do things oh yeah we go out uh sometimes we got to like a wet and wild park it's uh kind of you know ah yes yeah we've we've got a big one coming up this uh uh one in this summer we hope we live uh in the western part of the United States and we're thinking of going to the south west and doing some hiking and camping and stuff like that well yeah that i hope will be an experience that our kids remember for i well the rest of their lives yeah and maybe pass on to their kids uh that's what my folks did with us you know really yeah we went camping and stuff in the Big Horn and the Teton so oh okay yeah i know uh there's some good memories yeah yeah but and that's one of that's one of my favorite things uh thinking back to those shared activities and all the little things like the the tent leaking and uh yeah running out of gas or things like that tend to uh disappear in those fuzzy warm fuzzy memories from uh years later oh yeah and one we went camping and the next morning we woke up and there's snow on the ground so yeah i had an experience like that in the in the mountains here in Idaho in which uh yeah it was just raining a little bit early in the morning and when it turned into snow in August we said no let's move down a few thousand feet yeah oh yeah i kind of miss that and we hadn't really had a chance lately to go um-hum camping or anything but we're thinking about doing a big trip this summer to go camping because the wife's in school and it's kind of hard to go and do anything when she's in school and stuff so well right right well that kind of works out for us too and uh we also have commitments with the rest of our family in that uh as well as being parents we're also kids and uh my wife's parents uh want us to get together for family reunions for instance oh yeah unfortunately the family's on the other side of the country and uh yeah that's mine my family is up north and they are kind of all over um-hum most of them are in Wyoming and then i got one sister that's in New York so so you can spend a lot on travel too oh yeah because i live in Texas right now so um-hum uh oh dear but you know we like i said we do a lot of activities with our son and stuff we play games with him in the house and everything uh um-hum there are times when i wish that i had more time to spend with my kids uh today i was busy working well well i try to get over and visit my daughter who's doing some computer stuff at school and uh help out with that and this morning about oh fifteen minutes after i knew they'd started that i  well the health care several of the candidates i think in particular i think it was Senator Carey wanted to do national health care we're we're in we're in a disaster we need we need some sort of health care that's available to everybody and the prices just seem to be really escalating the price of medication is is so exuberant that uh a lot of people just can't afford it and insurance is is so expensive well uh even even for older residents senior citizens the Medicare and Medicaid does not cover enough of what they need uh-huh and social security as far as helping them in their retirement is not going to be adequate by the time we're ready for it uh-huh and and doctor doctor visits medicine hospitalization if they increase at the rate they are now um-hum there's not going to be anybody that can afford it um-hum well you know i just i don't have i'm an older student but i'm going i went back to school and like i'm just finishing up but so my finances are kind of shaky at times and i can't afford dental insurance and i had to have to have a tooth extracted and i had to pay cash for it and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i said i said i i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars and he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fingers fingers in the pie too and that's it's sort of like trickling down for the overall cost and the the doctors have um might say a production line and just like i i said well how much is it going to cost he goes well it'll cost you um seventy dollars he no he says it'll cost you seventy dollars and then i require an x-ray okay and so it'll cost you a hundred and two dollars well i knew which tooth it was and he knew it was too and all i needed was extract it but he wanted he wanted to make the money so they're they're they're taught that people should have certain services whether regardless of whether they need them or not exactly and they're making it almost impossible for people to go and get well routine care shall we say insurance now won't cover uh wellness visits uh-huh uh-huh or uh children baby visits your insurance won't cover that anymore but uh-huh um-hum and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesn't even cover things like that um-hum and the thing is just like dental hospitalization and dental it's unbelievable i haven't you can go to the hospital and you'll pay four dollars for a aspirin i haven't been in the the job market for oh three or four years i mean i i've worked and things but i haven't really had you might say a full-time job health coverage and things like that but i've uh done you know i've done readings and and things and in fact i was watching on the TV is that if you work for a small company just say maybe thirty to forty employees and you have they're insured and your employees are sure are insured under what's called the group plan uh-huh well if one or two of the people in that group happened to have a chronic illness where it it you need they need care all the time like say they had a child that that needed uh a lung machine and a respirator and a nurse to come in and things like this well what they would do is they would just cancel everybody's insurance and say we're not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance exactly our our group medical plan has increased every year in the past three years uh i work for Edward D Jones stockbrokerage where do you work uh-huh uh-huh and it's just every year uh-huh every year is just a little bit more of course our you our cost um aren't hardly anything compared to people that have to go out and get their own because of the group plan but um-hum um it is the costs have increased every year then plus the coverages they they decrease so you they don't want you to see the the the deductibles increase too um-hum exactly we did start a plan this year there's an insurance company through Metropolitan Life that has started a flexible plan um-hum and with that they will take out pre tax dollars and build it up and it will cover things that your regular insurance won't eyeglasses uh dentist visits um um-hum uh wellness care prescriptions that are not covered through your insurance and that's the first time i have seen any um-hum um-hum effort effort at all um-hum to make a change in the  so do you think we have an immigration problem right now well it's hard to say there is certainly uh some discussion about that with the uh people trying to come in from Haiti and uh the government wanting to send them back if there is no clear evidence of uh political uh repression um-hum uh the country has set itself for so long as the uh the haven for people from other places uh giving them an opportunity for a new start but uh was back in the days when there was a lot of a lot of land and a lot of opportunities that uh just don't seem to be available now um-hum well i think i think there's still is a lot of land it's just not particularly desirable land yeah i think i think you know the plains were never completely settled that's true uh you know uh you know i'm i'm sure we i'm i'm i'm sure that you know there's plenty of room for room for immigrants in North and South Dakota but i just don't think that most immigrants want to move to North or South Dakota that uh that's true the uh i i think the fact though that there is not a standard uh or or an equitable policy in place is causing a lot of trouble um-hum uh there was a essentially essentially an immigration lottery a few months back yeah i've been hearing about that it seemed like the silliest thing i'd ever heard you know the it you you can immigrate totally without merit um-hum but um because you know you you get the lucky number right and one of the things that uh that everyone was up and arms about was that uh there was a certain preference given to uh to people coming over from Ireland um-hum and how how a decision like that is made uh oh we don't have enough Irish in this country just just seems to be be fairly strange uh uh either you know oh if we feel that we've been wrong in in keeping the Irish out or whatever it is i i don't understand um-hum how this is all working and i'm not sure the people who are running it understand it either um-hum i probably agree well what what do you think we could do to make it better that's that's the hard question that that always seems to be the hard question i don't know that there's there's a lot we can do short of either uh not allowing any immigration whatsoever or opening the flood gates i think that any middle ground is going to uh have its it it it's going to have uh people complaining about discrimination and uh and other problems like that uh it's interesting to me to see the uh the current administration welcome people from one country and then people who are who are battling to get here from Haiti uh are are rounded up thrown on a military base and shipped back at the earliest possible moment um-hum um-hum uh given the fact that uh a democracy was overthrown in Haiti it it's uh contradictory to the the policy of supporting democracy throughout the world that now we want to turn around and send them back because they don't like the uh the government the current government that overthrew the democracy um-hum it it it seems you know it seems almost as absurd as a few years ago when um and we uh you know we'd welcome uh refugees from Nicaragua for political reasons but you know if they're from El Salvador then um-hum right then they couldn't be fleeing to for political reasons because you know we we were friends with that government right right and i i think that maybe that selectivity is is a bigger problem than just the problem of immigration um-hum is that when it is selective like that is fairly visible and people realize that uh oh yes we'll let these people in because uh we we don't like their government um-hum uh it it it's an odd situation of course we haven't touched on at all what happens when these people with no visible means of support come to this country without any contacts or any uh were this skills that you know that are really marketable in our country or any right because you know you know of the yeah the the see especially hard to  alright what do you think well uh i think air pollution is a pretty big problem right now and it's i mean i think it's a real bad problem i don't think that a lot is really being done about it at this point and there's just things like uh for a i think that cars especially here in the United States are just a major source of the pollution when you consider that most people have at least one automobile and people drive around all the time and i think you know if you just totaled up i don't know any of the exact figures but all the millions of cars that are driving around spewing out carbon monoxide all the time i think you're going to end up with a pretty big uh number right right um and if you look at other countries like in the third world and stuff where people ride bikes and all that i'm sure that their uh air quality is much better than ours just as a result of their lack of having cars like if you look at Los Angeles i mean they've they said that the major reason that it's so smoggy there is because they all sit and drive down the freeway everyday hum okay well um i i mean also along the same lines i know that there's somebody i i read one time about um somebody's developed uh a test to look at the emissions from um your car uh-huh right you know you know i i just don't understand i mean everybody's so concerned right now about recycling and everything i think that's pulled away from the focus of air pollution uh-huh and we're making all these changes with cars and everything and and and battling to have US built cars versus other countries and we're not looking at um the air quality that we're producing from our cars uh-huh right and there was just i just saw today that uh President Bush they were had new a new regulation out that was going to put a canister to collect some of the exhaust fumes on most new cars and he uh is not going to let that regulation pass through because he says that well it's going to cost too much money and take too many jobs away from the people up in Michigan and i just think that's ridiculous that i mean if they've developed the technology to remove some of the harmful pollutants that come out of people's exhaust pipe and not implementing it is just seems kind of ludicrous to me yeah i i i hadn't heard anything about that uh-huh well you know until these older model cars i mean granted i have an older model car but i mean some of the some of the really older ones that you know the mufflers falling off you know and they're not quiet up to specs but they're still being driven around right uh-huh right you know and you can i mean i'd go behind somebody the other day and you mean you saw this this huge amount of smoke pouring out the back of their car and you had to change lanes to get away from them uh-huh you know and i mean if you can see it and smell it that badly on that vehicle think about how many others are pouring out that you can't see and smell right exactly uh the another thing i don't know here in the Midwest in Indiana at least we produce most of our energy burning coal and if you just look at some of these there's a coal burning electricity plant here in town and you can just sit there and watch the the smoke stacks and the amount of pollution that just pours out of there that's right i use to live right next to this plant and every single day you would go out and your car would just have you know it's not like three inches of dust or anything but you can see the dust that had come out of this smoke stack and just fallen right down on your car and you know they say that the the coal we burn here in Indiana is responsible for a large part of the acid rain that they have up in New York state and in Canada and all that and it's just you know it's ridiculous when we could be spending the money to develop the technology to you know clean up some these uh sources of pollution like the smoke stacks but then the big businesses say well we can't do it because it's going to cost us too much money and it's like well we kind of got to think a little bit more forward instead of you know we're not going to make as much money this year because we're trying to clean things up i just it kind of that's right that's bothers me well i know in Dallas um i'm i i live pretty close to downtown to Dallas and you know and there are days you just you open the door and just go huh i'm not leaving here today you know uh-huh yeah and and i mean there's uh there's a place that used to be called Concrete City and they have all these things where they used to burn um and and what they would burn off would be lead uh-huh uh-huh and now you know i mean here they've been spewing this stuff out for forty years or more and they're just now beginning to figure out that you know that what they've done is is wrong right you know and now we're trying to clean that up but you know we've seen the visible effects in the soil but it makes me wonder what kind of effects that it's had on the atmosphere that we don't know yet um-hum right you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now right so yeah all and all i think that we really i mean almost if you look at almost any industry it's it's producing so much pollution i mean they're spewing out just tons of this atmospheric garbage every single year um-hum and something really ought to be done because it it's basically we don't see the problem right now and like you said even the pollution that we're putting out now is not really going to affect anybody for twenty thirty years so i don't think it's got i mean the the past right  so um i pretty much read the paper do you yeah read i catch the news sometimes uh but we're so busy usually i just grab the paper at work uh-huh uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that yeah yeah uh i don't watch i don't watch any TV really um and i i don't subscribe to the paper but a lot of the people who i work with do and uh yeah i i like grab the paper like to see how my stock is doing and things like that because i don't always call my broker and things uh-huh but actually now that i think of it the thing the place where i get most of my information is i have an hour commute in the morning and in the afternoon um-hum uh so we listen to NPR a lot and we hear we listen to Morning Edition in the morning and Fresh Air and All Things Considered in the afternoon oh uh-huh so uh and even if we're not listening to the feature stories we certainly tune in at the top of the hour because you got about six minutes of good news and uh-huh i guess i get most of mine um just from word of mouth just people chatting at work and stuff yeah i i'd like to get you know things little straight a little more from the horse's mouth although i dislike the way that the media for instance distorting the the campaigns like oh big surprise Clinton won in the South you know um-hum right you know this must mean he's the frontrunner now why because you know all of his region votes on one day right um but you know i i find especially NPR is fairly unbiased you know i use to watch CNN a lot when i got cable right uh-huh because uh they also seem to not lean one way or the other in their reporting uh-huh uh our local papers like the Boston Globe you know where you we have you know you've got the Boston Globe which is extreme in one way and the Manchester Union Leader which like supports Buchanan and things uh-huh uh-huh so between the two of them you know it's not a lot of and then you've got the Boston Phoenix Weekly with the nine hundred ads in the back you know but other than that there just isn't a lot of you know unbiased local print reporting uh-huh right yeah the the the constitution is is pretty bad too and and they it it just seems like they spend a lot too much time on trivialities and things you know they they emphasize the wrong things especially in the campaign yeah and and i i don't even bother with local news because it's it's like you know um i'm a pilot so i'm aware of how how they misrepresent you know it's like a guy would do a gears up landing and it'd be there was a crash landing today and our camera crew was there huh-uh uh-huh um-hum uh you know they they or and then of course on sweeps it's how you can get cancer from eating common foods but we're not going to tell you during the thirty second spot you know tune in for a twenty seven part report over the next three weeks right right um i really think that um you know you have to go to some uh place like NPR that doesn't have a vested interest in you know they don't really care about you know getting two hundred thousand people to watch their shows because they're funded by people who do want to hear this kind of news uh-huh right right and the other nice thing about my local uh NPR station is they also got monitor radio and the BBC really through yeah they do this this is basically our all news AM station 10A um-hum so what you get is you get uh they they've kind of picked up so you get like five AM they give BBC then you've got uh you've got Morning Edition from like six till nine then they pick up again with the BBC um-hum then in the afternoon you get uh the NPR's talk show and then you've got uh Fresh Air at four All Things Considered till seven then you get Market Place then they give you BBC again um-hum what so it's really you know for they they've got a bunch of classical music in the afternoon but other than that it's just straight news reporting from about four different sources um-hum oh that's nice and you know it's kind of neat to see how the BBC reports things differently you know they they've got a much different view like reporting South Africa and the Middle East uh-huh uh-huh um i find that NPR and the BBC has a much more global view than like ABC or one of the US ones right right but you know because you know i find that um a the the American uh electronic media is so uh ethnocentric uh-huh where you know they they they don't realize for instance that there's a recession happening in the rest of the world too it's not not just us lucky people right right um so you know that's pretty much where i get my information from uh and you know i'll i'll glance through the Boston Globe to get the local news there and i'll glance through the uh like the Milford Cabinet uh the National Telegraph to get the really local news uh-huh oh really yeah it's like the Globe gives you like regional news uh and Boston news uh-huh like my fiance is telling me the Globe sucks uh and and then you get like uh you know the uh the Telegraph and the Cabinet is giving you like how your high school football team did and what's being voted on and you know we got our picture in the Telegraph in the in the Cabinet because we went to the school board meeting um-hum so you know that that's the kind of level of stuff you get there so you get a real diversity of coverage yeah um-hum  i got a budget that i worked out on a spreadsheet that i keep on my home computer the only thing is that i kind of drifted away from it originally when i set it up um i'd started back to school and had all these grand plans and sat down and figured out everything to the penny all the way down to haircuts every little thing i could imagine spending money on and got it all set up and then kind of got tuned to it and for about a year or so i kept real good track of bills and made sure things fit into it but i got to the point where my spending habits pretty much stabilized and i just knew what they were i don't think i've looked at that thing in a year and a half uh i wish i could say that we did the same in terms of our family uh it we have considered it from time to time and the problem that i always got into was the hassle of keeping track of all the data and then deciding basically what we was going to do about it um because to me the need for a budget is especially when money's tight and i'm happy to say that money's not too tight we just kind of drift along yeah uh we've gotten into troubles recently while the last couple of years we're all of a suddenly uh it's IRS time and we look and say ooh we owe a lot of money but we've even recovered from that and so i guess our budget is mostly in our head yeah keeping it keeping all the records and all that stuff is a pretty high maintenance thing takes some dedication to really sit down and do it but it definitely does pay off if you keep track of things keep a good grip on it how does it pay off for you well by seeing the flow and stuff like that i can see where there's a lot of uh frivolous frivolous waste too much uh going out things like that that really i can do without those kind of things it's hard to um to just go out and keep a day to day balance of stuff right reminds me years ago i had trouble quitting biting my nails and i read some uh suggestion that said well you know if you keep them all and tape on a piece of paper and see how many you know nails you're biting off you'll be amazed and uh man that that ended it in about a week um and the same thing for the budget huh yeah very similar procedure interesting i i just got a lecture today from my mother about being frivolous she wants me to be more frivolous and so i guess my thought there is uh not to uh not to look at it and say oh my goodness i'm not allowed to do this on the other hand uh i think i'm ready to elect you to Congress uh uh in terms of actually considering a budget and staying with it really that has got to be one of the worst problems we've got here today right and it's hardly considered you know here it is uh a an election election year and you hardly hear anything about it right right especially the deficit this massive looming black cloud waiting to break out on us yep and so i think we as a society tend to have uh at least now kind of uh well budget who needs a budget i mean we're having fun yeah yep and so i guess i'm kind of midway between the the party party party side and the uh uh oh my goodness we got to look at every last cent actually your story reminds me of uh when back in college uh i had overspent my budget which was kind of haphazardly kept but it became very obvious when i had something like twenty eight dollars left for the month of February uh and it got very obvious as to what i was going to do uh and some of that included eating um yep uh i it was called subsist on peanut butter and jelly for the the month and at one point some girls in a sorority that i knew uh that i hung out at felt sorry for me and took me in the back room and fed me a salad yeah colleges and education in many ways you bet you bet i think the reason why they did was they were afraid that somebody else was going to win the pool on whether i was going to die of berry berry or some sort of disease like that i haven't resorted to um peanut butter but i have had to go to long periods of ragu and um pasta well at least you're not down to cat food ooh ooh actually we've got a stash of that we had a cat but it ran away uh oh no um so we've got a good bit we've got a dog now and it'll eat the cat food though that's its treat at the end of the day sounds like a dog with a complex well he's a puppy i don't thing he really knows knows too much of uh the difference yet uh great it's good food fortunately that's cheap and it fits in the budget twenty five cents a can yeah right right well as long as you're not teaching him how to meow or something like that well i've been trying to teach him to sing lately yeah that's uh it hasn't been real successful but he barks real well oh really uh reminds reminds me of that old adage never teach a pig to sing the results can be really terrible and besides it annoys the pig uh  how old are your kids i have two little girls i have um one seven and one five and a half and um i'm divorced i'm just now i'll be divorced this month so i'm pretty much raising my kids myself oh yeah oh okay that's a hard task yeah it is but they they're wonderful they turned out wonderful and they're obedient and smart and bright and well adjusted and so i'm blessed right um that's that's fantastic yeah um a lot of times well i guess the majority of their of their early growing up years they had a full family right um not really because he was in the Marine Corps oh so he traveled around a bit and was on duty yeah he was gone a lot and and um stuff like that but um okay yeah i i find myself comparing it to my sisters because both of them have been divorced um one had one child and the other had three um-hum and i have been determined not to ever have them in day care though children have never been in day care never um good job i uh have always been home with them and then when my husband decided he wanted to be free and uh left i that's a euphemism huh that's a euphemism huh huh yes and um he i uh prayed and found a way to make money without putting them in day care so i clean houses um-hum and um i do it while they're in school and i make my own hours and i'm home when i want to be home and right right um so i have plenty of time and um we read um-hum um quite a bit and um we bicycle we all three of us have bicycles yeah great that sounds good sounds like there's some quality time being spent there so that's our there's Saturdays and Sundays is is um afternoons are bicycling and um try to go to the park and um right it are you calling from the South yeah can't you tell okay yeah i i noticed a bit of an accent there where about are you calling from um East Texas oh okay okay round Dallas that'd be about the biggest place you know that i'm from and i'm from a small a smaller city though it's not not that big it's big but it's not that big right okay uh-huh right but it's warm enough to where you can do that kind of bicycling stuff generally pretty much all year round um uh for the most part pretty much pretty much because we've had pretty weather yeah oh that's good and um not too much rain right oh it's been awful lately it's rained a lot yeah but we we watch TV we watch in in the evenings we sit down and watch TV together um like from six to eight or something like that we watch TV together before they go to bed and um yeah um-hum right a lot of people frown on that just on on TV in general but i don't know i i think my own personal opinion is that it it helps to instill a sense of values and moral as long as it could be explained explained and as long as there's good monitoring going on um-hum right because my children know what they can watch and what they can't and if they see something that does not right sound right from the way they've been raised they will say something about it um-hum yeah that's good so um and i will tell them that's not acceptable behavior that's not right we don't do that so um and we don't watch um no right okay you know really adult bad you know we watch Cosby Show i mean you know that type of sure um yeah well that's that's good family moral type stuff you know which is good great right right so we enjoy that and um heavily involved in church and um go to that you know together and uh-huh yeah did they see their grandparents often or no um because i don't mind are um passed away and my husband's are out of state so they're not they don't they just mainly have me oh sorry um-hum yeah well that's that's important for you to be there then for a lot of the time you know um-hum that's good i my sister my closest sister is the same way in terms of day care pretty much to where she really tries to not have them in day care because you tend to pick up bad habits that way and other other people um-hum you do and they're treated um wrongly a lot of times and you don't know it right you don't know what kind of moral people are inflicting on your children and things like that so yeah that's a good thing i'm i'm myself am am not married but am beg your pardon right right how old are you how old are you i'm twenty six i'm twenty five okay i've kind of devoted myself to school but uh-huh uh right now i'm i'm getting closer to marriage and things are getting very serious and we're talking about these kind of issues and things so good to hear a viewpoint from someone who is actually in the situation um-hum yeah i i think it's important to really think really hard before you get married and before you have kids and and when you make that commitment to stand by it not to a few years later go well um yeah  Steve yeah how do you keep up on current affairs well Frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um uh i guess if part of me says if it's that important i'll find out if i don't find out it's not that important into the way that it affects my life right now um uh-huh that's a good way of looking at it that's i guess that's primarily why um we do go through periods where we uh uh-huh do get the local newspaper um you know and for for a city of a hundred and eighty thousand people the newspaper is still very slanted and uh you know you end up and you say well yeah okay and you slightly liberal to the left or to the right uh what'd you say oh i would say maybe it's a little morbid to the right now you know here we kind of talk more liberal and conservative rather than left right but uh it's a fairly liberal minded um i see huh uh-huh but you know it's uh you tend to only get the one side you don't get kind of uh a broad coverage of of the reality of what happened uh-huh uh-huh well i get my uh news from really from all the sources uh i will say probably radio is uh is a prime source because i like to listen to radio news uh on the hour for world news and then it the station i listen to usually have local news after that and i also watch the TV for for news and i take two newspaper uh the local city newspaper here in Portsmouth and also the state newspaper which is the Manchester Union Leader so uh you know that's that's how i stay informed plus from talking to people as you say if it's real important you're going to hear about it from other people besides right yeah i i guess i would think that you have a bit of an advantage in that you do have a an option for something that is more local and then something that is more statewide um-hum um here i guess really we're dealing with uh the regions being i i hesitate to say sparsely populated but really you know we'll get to one region that's uh several hundreds miles square and we've only got a few million people involved right and uh you know so regional coverage uh is pretty sparse and so we our next step from local tends to be virtually national or international uh-huh and and i suppose you might compare it to you don't hear very much North Dakota news no um you know so but you do but you do i i take it uh we we can at times you know being you know being right on the north edge of North Dakota we uh-huh uh we actually uh some of the current events are more an aspect of uh some uh sports interaction between North Dakota and Saskatchewan uh-huh and uh it's not hardly an current event as such but um Minot does a lot of advertising to uh bring tourist industry down i see um so you know we kind of get stuck with uh you get your local news or you get your news that's based nationally and uh so then it has um-hum anything that intends to be local interest uh is quite localized Toronto Montreal Ottawa Vancouver that kind of thing you know so you're getting uh um-hum well we have a sports interaction with Quebec mainly uh Montreal uh the teams there uh both baseball and with uh with hockey of course and with Quebec and uh Quebec City um-hum and also uh one of the uh TV TV stations uh from Canada is on the cable system in this area uh from Sherbrook oh yeah um-hum so uh we we do have some news from from Canada from time to time yeah it's uh yeah and you know i suppose of our television we with our cable system we get uh three Detroit stations and we've got three Saskatchewan stations with do you have CNN do you have CNN uh yes we do we also have CNN which that can be an important source of news international yes uh yeah i i actually i really enjoy their format and so it is it can be quite informative on an international basis uh um-hum so um i guess that would probably be my primary source for international news but uh not on a right regular prescribed basis tend to uh or i happen to be there and i'm and uh  okay you first all right um well basically i think we uh probably pay more out in taxes than we should uh we don't see the sort of feedback that we need from it um i think the government waste a lot of the money um and spends it on purposes that that the government really shouldn't be spending it on um i don't think that it's effectively used yeah i i agree i don't think it's uh effectively used um as far as the amount um so i'm never really sure about the amount because there's so much that needs to happen in this country that isn't happening and that not that the government necessarily should be the agent through which it's accomplished but there's a lot of things that are crying out for somebody to do something with and the last fifty years everybody looked to the government for that sort of thing primarily um-hum right and uh i i agree with you that things are just not used effectively yeah i think and we you know people don't want to live within their means we've got huge deficits that doesn't appear to you know nobody's talking about the deficit at all on the current campaigns at all um-hum right right and i was amazed in the State of the Union address and Bush i don't think mentioned the D word once the whole time it was amazing and it kept he keeps coming with these spending plans and i'm like okay where is the money coming from exactly exactly i mean it they keep on thinking that you know it's okay to borrow against the future indefinitely um and they don't realize that once they create these programs yeah um-hum you well they have such a hard time killing off a program yeah once once it starts receiving funding it its like yanking wisdom teeth to try and get it uh right yeah killed you know even when and you know i don't know a lot of the things i think the federal government does uh it does very poorly um i'm kind of a state's right person and i think that a lot of of what the federal government could do could be handled uh more efficiently uh on a state level um-hum um-hum uh you know state to state because the states i think have a better idea of where where they need to spend the money for the kind of population that they have um and i think the federal government is just too far removed from the the specific situation yeah yeah um you know i mean there there are some things that our taxes need to be spent on um at a federal level like national uh defense and uh you know common rule making and things like that um-hum but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so yeah yeah and round most of those are state administered aren't they um yes and no um a lot of it you know the states get like matching funds or you know they they get a certain amount of funds that they get to do with as they please but um um-hum okay why you know why doesn't the state take in the revenue directly then you know uh kind of eliminating some of those bureaucracy that goes on right right right if if yeah it sounds sounds very good and i but i wonder about states like Mississippi and Louisiana that always tend to have and Arkansas and Arkansas significantly with Clinton running but it states that always seem to have really poor educational systems um and just generally a very very poor economy i mean Louisiana was picking up for a while with the energy boom in the seventies but still their economy never really got off the ground and you know it it i don't know i don't live in Louisiana or any of those states and i don't ever think that i will but so it's really none of my business but it's like something you know i i it's um-hum i don't know it seems like somehow not enough is being done to educate people there and things like that to to be able to participate with yeah the rest of us in the in the world it's just pre elitist but you know the the rest of us in the country at least yes oh yeah i agree exactly um and then i yeah i know there's plenty of people in California here who don't have enough education either i mean you know that's always the a major political football problem in any state the education system um-hum oh yeah yeah i well i think we're seeing a major decline um but yeah um i'm i'm not sure how that relates directly to taxation um yeah that's true that's true uh trying to stay on the topic here yeah well i don't think it really matters anyway because it you know they'll what they want is natural conversations and i think the topic just to kind of give us a boost in that direction right yeah but getting back to taxes um currently i think the the current system we got isn't really it it isn't taxing the rich enough essentially um it i think that hum people people don't have an idea that the whole we're all in this together and in the eighties that wasn't the common theme the common theme was you know get rich quick for a lot of um-hum right  oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because of because of the latest check writing scandal i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund okay uh i don't know what do you think well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up and seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i don't quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency well it sort of i i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manager managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals so well i think one of the problem is again isn't really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect um-hum further removed cause and effect get the the uh more problems you have i remember an incident um back when i was in Dallas um-hum where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh i don't remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that that they they wouldn't really have to pay for them i think they'd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest um-hum and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why um centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i i don't know i i uh i rather think we're not going to see the end of the deficit for some time although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall i'm not sure they're they're kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now uh running against Washington so that's so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know hum trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking that's kind of strange i don't think they're going to i don't think i don't know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially you know we had Robert K Dornam who's been a gap fly of a lot of uh he's he's been uh uh Orange County's um uh i don't know i embarrassment i guess he's he's really terrible they um never voted down a a weapon's package ever and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that that one check that he he uh he he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a Madonna for his for his for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny well i think it's easy to you know once you get in the position of power it's easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying yeah yeah i very much so um you know it's hard to be ethical i think um-hum that must be why we see so many that i mean it's hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say yeah that may be why we see so many corrupt officials do you think it's because other people because people are spending other people money they got uh no i just think it's because power corrupt absolutely  are you a football fan i guess you are in Florida aren't you oh yeah yeah i'm a football fan i'm actually from Michigan and uh my favorite uh college football team is the University of Michigan oh uh-huh and uh my favorite pro team uh even though i'm down here still loyal to Detroit Lions even though they they lose most of the time i'm still a die hard uh Detroit Lions fan uh uh they did well last year didn't they yeah they did pretty well i was real happy with them last year uh the Miami Dolphins when i'm down here when whenever they don't they don't play Detroit very often but when they do i root for uh Detroit but uh when Miami's playing anybody else i usually root for Miami now that i'm down here yeah that's you that was my favorite since i was about ten years old i think the Miami Dolphins oh really you like Jim or uh yeah you like Marino Dan Marino yeah i do yeah i do he he's a good quarterback i followed him more when they had Larry Csonka and stuff Griese and this was quite a while ago yeah that's the old that's the seventies Dolphins right yeah i'm not that old i'm only twenty seven but i just remember them playing a lot we just moved down from Seattle and we use to go see the Seahawks all the time Seattle Seahawks that's right they would do well for a few games and then they they haven't made it in the play-offs for a long time well did you go to school in Washington State or anything like that or um i worked up there for Boeing for two years okay so the Huskies are pretty good right oh yeah that's right yeah they were really good up there we moved right before they took uh well yeah right we watched them down here for the Rose Bowl they always beat Michigan in the Rose Bowl the University of Michigan always make it to the Rose Bowl but then some uh Pac-10 team always beats them yeah they were they had a good team i was pretty impressed with them yeah they had well we followed BYU here that's who my team was and that's uh Washington came in second that year that ah you you're near Salt Lake then um you know where Brigham Young is no well they're i'm about an hour and a half from the campus i never went there i just like their passing their offense that's why i like watching them but that's about how far it goes oh do do you work at Morten Syco um i work at Morten okay i interviewed out there one time yeah oh you did i work in the airbags oh okay i'm a process engineer there oh okay Syco is the there are two separate companies now oh okay i didn't know that and so Syco is the rocket booster and we do the airbags that i i interviewed with them back in eighty six oh huh still going to college end yeah that's right when i graduated yeah what do you uh-huh well do you go see these football games very much i mean actually in person not i went to one football game down here in Florida i watched Miami Dolphins oh that must've been fun well actually terrible they built that Joe Robbie Stadium there in uh in Miami and it's not a covered dome and when it when it does rain down here in south Florida it just it just comes down in buckets uh-huh and that particular Sunday it poured like it had never poured before and that place was like a giant funnel all the water goes down to the bottom of the field and the field just started filling up with water and in my seats up there they've got little drains but they don't they don't drain fast enough so we have water up to our knees oh you're kidding and you know warm rains tropical rains are okay but after a while you get the shivers you get cold uh-huh and it was just terrible interrupted the whole game and we went to the rest room for a while and uh there was guys emptying out the trash cans emptying out the plastic bags and cutting holes in them and putting them over their heads and stuff oh wow but the but the that that game they played the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami was beating them at first then they finally wound up losing at the end of the game so it was kind of a bomber game uh-huh so my my football experience down here in Florida has been very bad when i was in Michigan i loved to go watch U of M play uh i played high school football you know so i you know that's that's why i kept up with the sport but in Michigan it's a lot different because you can go there and it's cool weather you know down here it's hot weather it's hard to get into football yeah it is that fall weather is really nice to watch a football game in that really get you in the mood that late autumn sun and it's nice and cool you can bring in some peppermint Schnapps with you in the game you know what i mean uh-huh no it it is true i love that fall weather to watching a football game you can't beat that yep you get the apple cider and stuff on the way home and well how how many does that stadium hold at Michigan over a hundred thousand usually they have a hundred and three thousand normally i mean a hundred and three thousand because it's all bleacher type seats and it just squish everybody together but it it oh wow uh-huh hundred thousand yeah but when you're there it doesn't seem that bad because everybody's all all real nice and everything and uh like i say you just take a little hip flask of peppermint Schnapps or or something like that and everything goes real good uh-huh boy that should be fun yeah you have like tailgate parties there's like a golf course right near there and everybody uh has big tailgate parties you know that's get like a big bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and eat that before the game and drink beers and stuff like that and you go on out and watch the game it's really neat then after the game Ann Arbor is such a nice town uh it's a big uh it's a football town in the fall i mean it's just an all college town all around it's real fun uh-huh uh-huh did you go to school there i don't go to school at University of Michigan i went to uh Western Michigan University oh did what did you graduate in or did you graduate uh i graduated at Lawrence Institute of Technology in Southfield in Southfield Michigan uh i went to uh Western for two years and Lawrence Tech for three years oh okay well where did you go to school at um up here at Weaver State i don't know if you've heard of that no where  so well you can start uh i can start the notion of a of of universal service sometimes sounds real good but i i sometimes wonder whether it's if people aren't willing to do it do anything like that on their own and i guess it would have to be really and truly universal and then i think you start running into all sorts of people's religious objections and you know and and how do you make allowances for everybody's culture if you try to force fit everybody into things and yeah i just i the logistics of it just seem horrendous in a country is yeah i i frankly can't go along with the idea only because it's the same kind of thing that you see in countries like Cuba and uh other places where you're supposedly for the good of society you're to volunteer and help out and and do something very nicely for everyone and the problem comes into play in that if the people aren't interested in what they're volunteering for and they're not getting paid there's no incentive whatsoever and really you in in any group that depends on volunteers say uh the American Red Cross and something uh those kind of groups you can actually you could actually become a hindrance to the group if you aren't really interested and you're just there because you have to in what you're doing yeah yeah it it i don't know on the other hand there are other countries like Switzerland and Israel and France that have universal service um-hum uh you know which are democracies uh i don't know about France i know that Switzerland and Israel though are somewhat more homogeneous homogeneous oh yeah certainly i mean there's especially especially in Israel there's a particular the cause for the good of the nation especially when it's on the defensive and the region really inspires people to help out for the good of the country but we have yeah well but they still have a universal well uh close to universal draft uh and they still run into um-hum to problems there are some people who feel that women should not have to take orders from men because it leads to morality problems and i just think that you'd run into people who felt that way here not only uh peoples of a very strict Jewish cast but also i think that a lot of the fundamentalists would have problems with their daughters being under the um um you know having to take orders from a man and who knows what and uh you know i just so i i you get you get really torn on the other hand one of my one of my favorite science fiction books is a book by uh Robert Heinlien yeah uh called Starship Trooper or something and he talks about you had to serve the country in order to have the right to vote sure in other words you had to first show that it meant something to you in order to to have the right to say what ought to happen uh and so that you you know i'm sort of torn that idea makes a whole lot of sense too people who are just along for the ride why should they say how my money should be spent and why should they say what i ought to do well there should be some tangible benefit uh if if you really want to get into something where you want to have a full participation and have it work well is to have something where they select the programs or whatever that they wish to participate in and give them some tangible benefit for doing so to inspire uh more involvement on their part yeah right in the and that's the way i think you really over take over this problem or get rid of the problem of them you know conscientious objection or what have you if you give them the option of selecting what it is that they want to do i right right and and that's that'd be kind of an interesting way of doing it i think if you're going to do something like that because it instead of voting for a representative who votes for laws or whatever you vote by what you're willing to participate in yeah i i think it has a lot of potential but i don't think that we're going to ever see something like that get through in this country because of the yes but i can't get one right now no probably not mismatch of political nonsense that goes on in Washington yeah well and and the other thing is such for it to to truly be help  okay so what is your opinion on on drug testing well i can see it in certain cases where it might be uh somebody's in a position that uh perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe um pilots that um uh you you know fly jets and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people i could certainly see it being done but in general um you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that um so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab but there's got to be like a limitation do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way you're you're very conservative and and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested and uh you know whether legal rights and of that person i don't know there's certainly a lot of things to really consider uh when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people uh that's about it well yeah you're it it's not just a company's you're talking about company's liability if if if uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of um-hum um-hum of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to to to sure sure and i think that's what companies are doing uh more and more because there are products that are out there to to minimize their liability and there's also the case about just uh um health health and welfare of the um employees um-hum if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low and not only are not only they low there's all sorts of a of a benefits exactly sure sure uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick sure exactly the only thing is uh then there's there's there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that exactly exactly the only thing is uh the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive right if they have had like uh medications in the past let's say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe um that week they take an Advil and the Advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana right um and there's poppy seed type things i think everybody's aware of that but um where's the line where you where you say to somebody i'm gonna drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or where's well well the question you know how can you how can you do it right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who testses who test positive exactly that's that's where the real sticking point comes in it's not i don't think there's any problem with testing people it's what do you do with the information um-hum sure sure exactly and and the the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on let's say um you've taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications you've taken uh let's say you do come out positive and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there or you've had a cold and you've been on medication or whatever you come out positive is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on thrugs you know what i'm saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person right uh is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee you know what i'm saying right well yeah i think clearly the person who is the line operator line manager of the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing that should go to an entirely different um-hum um agency within the corporation um exactly and it's a they can that uh if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it it's kind of like uh i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that  not very good it's not been a good day i went i turned mine in about twelve hours early at noon i don't know i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with Carolyn so i hope she's turned it in are you eating i just go ahead i'll stop eating i just barely got home from the university i just barely got home from the university no it's okay say what tell you what we can do is uh i can punch the uh one then we after five minutes when the uh uh voice comes on we can talk all night if we want okay go ahead fire away uh i love the irony of uh talking about this subject on April the fifteenth but um i'm afraid i'm i'm i'm probably in the minority i i actually don't think that we uh pay too much in this country um um particularly uh in this part of the country where um i guess i agree with you i do have a uh a bone to pick with um uh the way taxes are distributed um i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from a federal form and the sales tax can't i think that's regressive and uh um it's kind of dumb i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax but then on the other hand i don't mind that it's only on you know things that aren't like groceries and that it's not on them well i mean nobody taxes groceries do they where oh yeah they do in Arizona is that right um-hum we have a pretty low income tax i mean pretty low tax rate here oh i think that the sales tax they just got to do something about it right it's but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes right but i guess when i hear when when i see the comparison between the United States and uh any other western country uh their their rates are like uh forty one forty two and ours are like thirty six thirty seven you know if you compute it as a percentage of total income all taxes lumped together we actually do pretty well there's there's there's no other country that's that is taxed as low as we are well and i still think having lived in Europe for awhile you know the difference in living conditions are certainly well worth uh what we pay for it yeah uh-huh i'm i'm not sure i understand what you mean well i mean i think i was in Germany you know for several years right and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have than have to live there oh you mean lowest end of living in spite of lower higher uh yeah i suppose that's true yeah um probably more less so now than it was ten years ago or whenever but higher taxes yeah still is that way to some extent yeah i think the other problem is you know it's it's easy to complain about taxes because they're something you theoretically can do something about right but i look for example and you you're not in the quite in the same situation but like school taxes for me biggest bargain in the world i wish i didn't have to pay any more for for to my physicians in a year than i had to pay for all of my school taxes right right yeah yeah since uh i send my kids to parochial school that's uh yeah that that's probably a little tougher on you it's not it's not quite the bargain that a guy would think but i mean i pay them gladly that's a decision i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like Canada and England and Germany do perfectly well with a uh two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools for the with the same tax money but uh i mean that's uh that's the way the Americans want to interpret it i guess that's all right but yeah i and if i were uh when i was single and again when i'm retired i will not mind paying uh what it takes to keep the schools good that's always been a high priority you know no i think that's just you though i do think yeah that's true i think in places i think in places like California people are beginning to find that in in areas that are fairly well off if you add the um uh people of various sexual persuasions and those who never intend to marry and those who are retired and those who are um just looking for fun they people with families turn out to be such a small minority that they can't get the tax bill passed no matter what happens yeah and uh there are big sections of the country where people with children of school age are such a small minority that they can't get anything done that seems um um like a cultural lapse i mean people were always used to be willing to ante up for the schools they of course i think with the graying of America we're gonna see that problem in lots of places right yeah people would rather um increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them but i think it's sad or build roads selfish and shortsighted yeah well uh  okay what would you rather have or you want salary too plus what what's most important to you well as far as tangible benefits go i would say that uh health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern right i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care dental and vision um-hum as well as good long term and short term disability plans uh goes a long way toward satisfying my needs um-hum well i'll tell you i think that is the most important thing i've uh i'm not working right at the moment but the company that i did work for excuse me i had health benefits you know dental vision all that pension plan um now i don't have that although i do have a pension that i'm drawing from them which thank God i had right but uh man i think those medical benefits are the most important uh you you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical and uh you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your of your compensation package right um i should knock on wood i haven't you know had any serious health problems or anything i've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since i left work and it was only for a cold you know and they can't really do anything for you anyhow so you might as well not even go yeah they look at you say well you're still breathing so uh yeah yeah right oh you've got a cold go home and take uh liquids and uh rest yeah but um that is definitely the most important um pension i guess is next um thank God that i had one i don't know what happened to the salary employees when uh the company went bankrupt but i was union so mine was being put into a like a trust fund you know right so but i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs or i suspect that it just disappeared yeah that's what i was thinking too i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there you know right so where what company do you work for um i work for a little start-up company here in Pittsburgh called Trans Arc um um um-hum have you heard of them no they we do uh distributive system software um-hum um-hum for Unix based workstations um-hum so no i i worked for a trucking company P I E nation wide you probably heard of that ah yes yes fact my mom drives trucks so oh does she really oh how about that yes so yeah i see uh after the merger uh you see a lot of Ryder PIE stuff on the road well you did so did did Ryder get out of the business is that what happened or well Ryder and P I E went together you know and then then that ended it right ah so that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing it really did it's it started i think a little bit before that but that when P I E and and Ryder went together why it was downhill from then on you know yeah and the the problem with that is you know when you leave a job you can continue your benefits for some finite period of time but when when the company goes bankrupt i mean the they're just cut off completely and you're responsible for your own right and and that's exceedingly expensive right yes it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits we could do that for eighteen months right but three hundred and fifty dollars a month God that's terrible it's definitely excessive you know so but anyhow uh and jobs aren't that hard to find to get another one that does pay your benefits you know and a lot of them that if you do get a job they don't pay benefits true yeah they're starting to to cut back especially start-ups i know here at Trans Arc we get uh we get health care and that's it and there's no dental or vision um-hum um-hum and the the short-term disability policy is is a ninety day policy and there is no long term disability policy um so you know at least in the case of this particular company they tend to scrimp a little bit there um-hum um-hum and you know of course they can use the excuse well we're a start-up yeah right but you know what's happening is the disability plan you know so many people are lying about their things God there's been big articles in the paper about that uh you know they claim a back injury and then someone goes out and spies on them and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks and and everything else you know right so i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen but uh well that certainly doesn't help matters any i mean you you get people who are willing to put their neck on the line to get you you know these additional benefits such um  well Kirk uh i believe in capital punishment i'm from Texas and we have that in in effect down here and uh i guess i'm kind of the old school you know an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth uh-huh uh-huh do you have um has Texas always had capital punishment or they ever had a period where they outlawed it uh no sir not to my knowledge uh they've always had it i see right from day one uh-huh i'd have to confess to you that uh i don't know what the i honestly don't know what the law in Maryland is i think we have i think we have a capital murder law uh uh-huh i think that's probably the only crime for which you know capital punishment is meted out um-hum my own i guess my own personal feelings are i tend to take a look at the social cost benefit ratio which sounds kind of callous but uh it's basically you know it what what is the net the net benefit to society if you execute someone for a particular crime versus say if you lock them up for the rest of their lives or something of that sort and in many cases i decide in favor of capital punishment in fact i think in most cases uh and there probably be a few instances in which i would think that maybe it wasn't warranted well well uh Kirk is capital punishment is that like death death yeah right uh-huh uh-huh that's that's death right and uh let's see Texas uses death by lethal injection now right well uh the death by the electric chair uh and uh let's see the last time that i was uh privy to it death by electric chair oh i see okay i see um-hum you see one of our problems is down here since we were one of the later states to join um-hum is that uh murder was rampant i mean uh horse horse thieving and was rampant down here in the old days and i bet you can go to any town within the state and find a hanging tree um um-hum um-hum um-hum and you know you stole somebody's uh horses or uh stole their cattle that was a capital offense and you got hanged from the nearest limb if uh you know you were caught um-hum um-hum so it's got goes back to the old days now i don't know about Maryland uh golly or what they did in the old days well Maryland's a pretty complicated state uh-huh because it's uh well because of its colonial you know background and then of course during the Civil War or during prior and during the Civil War it was a border state you know with half the state northern northern and half the state southern you know in sentiment and so forth um-hum i suspect that like most most states uh you know in the nineteenth century and so forth that they certainly had capital punishment yeah right uh it's not a Quaker state or something of that sort you know like Pennsylvania right um-hum but uh and i as i said i think we we have a a capital murder law on the books right now i guess my feeling you know i can set up some hypothetical cases where uh well suppose there was something uh you know a famous uh medical researcher who murdered his wife yeah you know now this you know the question is well what are the prospects of this medical researcher making medical break throughs that might benefit human beings in the future never mind that he murdered his wife is that what you meant while ago uh when you said you know about about uh putting them in prison actually what you meant what kind of contribution can they make if you don't murder them right you know and i i i think i'd have to sit down and say well what kind of contribution would they make and also what what right uh-huh um-hum right do you i think another element in it in it is what kind of society do you what what message are you trying to send to society i mean like the uh yeah i'm i'm actually in favor of things like uh if you're going to execute somebody you uh i don't see any reason why they shouldn't televise it you know or what have you it's uh um-hum yeah it uh uh you know people ought to be aware of what it is that you know what it is that they're doing and uh you know what what the sentence really means when you uh you know if you sentence somebody to death this is what it really means just like they show you what prisons are supposedly like um they pardon what well you you know you have the Christian view uh-huh and the Christian view is to forgive you know and uh um-hum and maybe try to rehabilitation rehabilitate um-hum and of course when you do that you know then your costs go up on that measure and those who have lost someone uh you know feel like that that uh the guy's escaped justice um-hum and uh so you know i can see that point too i'm just kind of the old line that uh i believe if you go out and kill your neighbor you know you can look to lose your own life um-hum sure uh and and it's true that uh some people uh you know uh go out and and commit a murder and they could really uh  okay um i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten i guess i would rate it a five in the aspect that i wouldn't want everybody to have guns and i think there should be limitations of like semiautomatics uh things like that should not be just given out to anybody In fact you know i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose um so i guess you know being that i come from a hunting family i'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons um-hum but yet allow hunting rifles uh things that people would use for sporting type of uh uh activity those would be fine but when you get into um a lot of the more complex weapons i would say yes we need to put restrictions on them um that's probably i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think um um-hum i definitely think that there some things shouldn't be limited like like you said rifles and um hunting rifles and probably handguns for people who use them to um-hum exactly for for self protection sure right and but i think the i think semiautomatic weapons people say they use them because it for sport but i i personally cannot see any use for them other than uh for for for only like people who just like have some sort of crazed i can't imagine that yeah um-hum you know ambition to use have high powered weapons or something to do massive amounts of killing uh yeah right and i mean you can only how much do you want the only thing i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is uh uh you know going to kill a massive amount of people or uh somebody that's escaping that's uh very dangerous um-hum semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch a person and and uh get him down but um right you know i i think of my family uh they're very much into sporting and uh you know as far as hunting and also like uh clay pigeons right um-hum things like that so they have may have some shotguns they may have other types of uh hunting type things but i figured if the if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody more than likely somebody would see it you know what i'm saying versus a right yeah you know a small handgun um that can be you know put right in your coat pocket and nobody would see it but yet you can't stop people from having you know a handgun in their home yeah that's true right even if there are small children around there's you know you can't say people with small children can't have guns and people without small children that may have grandchildren you know still have these guns but um-hum yeah right um i guess i i was always taught number one a gun isn't a toy right um you know and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sits down to them and say this gun can kill you know and don't ever play with it um-hum right um so i don't know if that makes a difference or what but well i think partly uh in that case i think that cases like that it's definitely um i think if you're to say okay we have to get rid of them all because you know they can only they only seem to do bad it it's um it's saying we're too um-hum but criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across borders to get them right right and people who people who have them and are responsible with them are are are being punished and people who um-hum and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to how to uh how to use you know to make sure that guns are put up as something as uh not a toy yeah because we had guns all over our house when we were kids and not that they were laying on the uh couch or anything like that but um right right um-hum right i never had an interest in them being in the fact that i knew that guns could kill and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns um-hum right and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy right and of course we were quite young and we went through uh the National Rifle uh Club and so we were taught um-hum you know kind of at a a good age ten and eleven and twelve to sit down with a kid and say okay if you gonna learn how to shoot a gun you're going to learn how to do it correctly and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and um-hum and know how to protect yourself but yet have this you know training so that kids aren't you know they have to have a certain respect for it right well i think i mean we i grew up in a family and and my father had two guns because he used to hunt years ago but um-hum sure stopped before really before i was old enough to remember but and i knew we had the guns in the house and the the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time um-hum sure yeah but we it was never my brothers and sisters nor i never i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun or let's go get the gun out it was just something you knew was there and the it was your father's and you you that was not something you'd go and play played with at all yes yeah and i think maybe uh and that's the type of the thing that should be you know stressed yeah i think so and and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what i i can't explain  as far as news and uh keeping up with it i get a subscription to Time Newsweek and US News and World Report and i also stay in touch with CNN whenever there's something interesting happening in the world uh-huh do you do you actually read all those magazines every week oh God i get a lot more than that those are just the news magazines that i get i barely have time i usually tear through um US News and World Report that's my least favorite i think i like Newsweek the most uh-huh well i uh i i keep up with what's going on by listening to the radio in the car and reading a newspaper daily newspaper and i i pretty much hardly ever uh see news on television yeah i i've if you're near Boston uh i i remember hearing in the car we can pick up WBZ pretty good yeah out here in Rochester we i also get the morning paper here um we we're Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper both owned by Gannett right i tend to read the morning paper just because it's more breaking news i also listen to short wave depending upon what the world conditions are like oh so you can pick up Radio Moscow or that sort of thing huh oh yeah Radio Moscow it it's gotten a lot stranger in the last several years it's they've added commercials and they have bad jingles and everything so it's pretty much like U S radio huh well that's what they're trying to emulate i think most people still head for the B B C World Service which uh i i like that for international news but sometimes it gets you know usually if something major happens now i head for CNN yeah that um the B B C World Service is broadcast on the F M band in near the Boston area oh yeah they have it's it's distributed through American Public Radio i guess and by our public radio station yeah they have a feed of that yeah you can also a lot of various C-SPAN has an audio service still which transmits the BBC World Service twenty four hours a day you know i in the only problem with that i have with getting the news from a lot of these places is probably the worst lately has become the newspaper because i i just despise fluff journalism um-hum you know i mean Iraq is bombed but no you're not going to see that today because here's Janey age five on the front page blowing bubbles you know right or here's uh one presidential candidate candidate saying rude things about the other one's girlfriend or something yeah yeah i it it you know the worst of them all is USA Today which is i call it useless today the McPaper right it's great well they they um they have a pretty small vocabulary don't they they oh yeah it's about the six grade it's basically a newspaper for those that watch TV yeah that's true it's pretty tough to find objective objective straight forward news i mean the the BBC's got their own slant their basically you know they're they're i think they're addressing their U S service to to Brits living here but in yeah that that's pretty they have some pretty obscure international news i mean like coming up next a five minute report on Nepal you know yeah they do they do good stuff on Nepal and South Africa you can get good stuff on and you know India and but it's not necessarily close to stuff i'm looking for they tend to make fun of the U S a lot i think oh yeah it's they they have A Letter From America i think it's Alastair Cooke who um who's been doing that program forever who comments on what life in America is like and uh most British seem more amused than anything else well maybe they're right what the heck so yeah i i tend to we have cable here and that tends to be pretty good for news but i also have a satellite dish so i you can watch some pretty strange news things the feeds on there especially during uh the Iraqi war where you could hear the anchor people you know screaming four letter words poor Bernie Shaw yeah do they um do do you use any electronic type news services like a you know computer network news services anything like that um i i have a uh you know i i found out about the service on Comp Dcom Telecom so we have access to you know there's there's um Clara News and you can also get on CompuBucks and uh read the news wires on there which you know i appreciate that one if i want to search for a particular topic you know that i know you subscribe to Clara Net service then yeah well either that or you can go on Clara News and use it or i'm sorry uh CompuServe and use their executive news service if you want to follow you know certain key words and i use to do that when we were interested in following the cable industry you know you wouldn't see this stuff in the local paper right yeah yeah we don't get the where i where i work i don't we don't get the Clara Net stuff  okay well so what i'm sorry go ahead what what kind of benefit uh benefits do you have at work well i i'm i work at a large company and uh we have quite a quite a few benefits and uh we have um uh-huh the best benefit i like is the uh amount of uh vacation time especially after uh working working there for a long time it really build up to the amount of vacation time i um-hum um-hum uh-huh i think that's one of my best benefits oh yeah is there a something that you wished you had that you don't or well one thing that i i uh wish uh in a big company there's more bureaucracy and uh less support of uh what you're doing i think and uh that's something that um yeah is uh probably and a benefit of a smaller company you get more support from the the people that you work for um-hum yeah i work for a relatively small company we're a trade association for credit unions and uh our benefits are fairly good and like you say that support i mean you work directly with the president and the executive vice president and you know they you get the feedback from them directly and i like that but i wish i really the thing i like i guess i wouldn't mind having a better retirement plan we have just a defined benefit plan and i kind of would like the idea of having a 401K or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions yeah that'd be a lot better i that's one thing i wish i had a little bit more of but you're really thinking of the future uh yeah i i don't know i'm kind of the type i just don't wanna work my whole life i'd rather be able to yeah make my money and be able to retire and enjoy a lot of things before yeah and so that's and that's one way i can see doing it but none of them i work i work for the state of Florida and uh it's pretty good retirement plan uh-huh uh-huh um we don't get paid very much but uh retirement plan is pretty pretty good works good yeah that's like i say ours we're we get uh vacation is pretty good too i mean it's you get a week after the first year two after the second three after the third and it goes up just every year by a week up until i think like six years which is a lot better than anybody else i'd ever heard of uh yeah yeah that's quite a bit of vacation to have after six years service so did you say you work for a credit union uh it it's a a credit union league they're kind of a trade association for credit unions we uh okay kind of do a lot of the uh political support and stuff like that for the credit different credit unions within the state yeah my wife used to work for a credit union group they magazine they had a newsletter that went out to all the but oh did she all the uh credit union CEOs and people like that so she was really into the keeping up on what's going on with the credit unions uh-huh uh-huh oh really huh what what did she work for uh it was it was a company um i think it was called Credit Union News or something uh-huh it was based out of uh i think it was Boca Raton Florida oh really yeah that sounds pretty familiar to me yeah it was pretty uh but uh pretty glossy kind of uh um-hum newsletter that comes out yeah well uh do you get to i don't know have you heard of any people that kind of do this uh the cafeteria plan where they kind of let you choose what kind of benefits you get or uh not too much is that something that Florida does or where your work the state of Florida or you pretty much get what they give you and nah yeah just i get what what you give in uh that's uh not not uh with not too many choices yeah i guess a lot of the more uh some of the newer companies and the up and coming real fast growing ones kind of do that way but some people say it ends up costing them more because whatever you know men and women alike they give them say three hundred bucks a month and they can buy their health insurance and their retirement and whatever but and if they whatever they don't use they get in cash yeah but a lot of companies don't like to do that because they figure if you got two people working then one spouse might take insurance and the other won't so it saves the company money yeah whereas this one you know you'd end up paying regardless yeah i guess but for the employees it sure sounded like a pretty good idea yeah but anyway i haven't uh haven't got so fortunate as to get into any of those companies yet yeah but anyway okay well well hey it was good talking to you okay all right see you later bye-bye okay bye  um i think um uh actually i'm uh fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit right i think it's health care it's what i think everybody would say that oh and then if you try to get it outside of your uh corporation you're gonna pay an arm and a leg right belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you right um so the um sometimes i think it's more important than salary uh do you also get dental yes and um i don't know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental can dental expenses can really kill you oh i know now my husband is with uh Northwest Airlines and he gets uh you know the full health and dental and uh we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous right and i don't know how people that don't have it can afford it right it's uh or maybe they don't right uh and then uh if the cleaning doesn't get you the orthodontics will that's right that's right uh i guess that would be up there uh i'm not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh um um pre tax savings was another thing that i think is a a great a great benefit when i uh-huh right and i really i think it's really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan right um well it's a lot easier to to save it when you don't get your hands on it first right when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldn't otherwise do and right uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the uh corporation for example uh oh leave yeah do they have even have do they have father leaves or anything like that you know i i don't think so yet they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take uh i their uh i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short uh-huh uh oh i do too uh uh i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks oh i think i think it's just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks right and and uh she isn't recovered and uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time there there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time um-hum right i agree it's uh it's so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up oh sure especially in this day and age you don't want to start over again anywhere um that yeah you're right i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i that i would most like to see uh changed um the uh parental leave well i think they're at they're coming they've come a long way um at least some companies right some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy and uh i just don't know how how women do it particularly single parents who don't have the support at the other end right uh they do it by shortchanging their kids there no other way that's right that's exactly right i mean uh unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely um with people moving as much right and uh they're just it's just a terrible choice you shouldn't have to make it uh um-hum right and uh one of the benefits we get of course is travel oh right boy would i like to have that it's wonderful the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you can't afford to stay once you get there yeah oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if you'd just fly me there i'll take care of that that's right you have to have an awful lot of fun just just getting there is has to be half the fun right so and uh i guess the uh the idea  you wanna go first well uh no i don't i don't get as much exercise as i as i should as or or as i would like to uh um these days i'd seems to be to easy to get busy with other things uh i have in the past uh jogged and and run and every every January and every September i start out again and then it tapers off really uh what about you well yeah i do a lot of exercise right now i'm into jazzercise which i absolutely love um i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years and i wanted to get it back off um-hum and i was going through a divorce and i just found that running really made me feel good got out a lot of aggression i went to the gym every day and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike and yeah um i felt really good i needed to do it and it was really helpful at the time now when i do those things they are boring i would rather be outside than in the gym doing this in one place um-hum and so i just recently discovered jazzercise about two months ago and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it and i'm just feeling really good i love the class it's real challenging so i'm really into that i really like that a lot and it well now that's that's it it that's related to the the aerobic uh society it is it's aerobics but it's with dance steps it's an aerobic exercise and it's an hour straight and it's just um it's a lot of fun i feel like i'm not just exercising okay yeah yeah because i'm dancing and i'm i'm getting much better my stamina's getting great for the dance floor so i mean it's just there's a lot of positive things with it so yeah well uh okay now that's inside again right it is inside and i've been doing a lot of bike riding outside with the nice weather we've been having and i enjoy that much more too than inside but it do do you like to do it with with other people i mean like the the jazzercise would be i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework so i've enjoyed that part of it yeah yeah yeah and at the gym even in the class uh i we do we it's not really a group where you chat a lot everybody's on their way to someplace right but and so you know i do have one friend that goes occasionally but basically i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty so yeah right right but still there are other there are other people there doing the doing the same thing in that in terms of motivation and incentive yeah there are there are it's more motivating that way i think yeah yeah you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the TV but you you probably wouldn't yeah yeah uh that makes a difference doesn't i i've one thing more when i have so yeah run and jogged uh i've always enjoyed doing it by myself and and no no not with the sense that was a a chore or something that i was having to do i i've really enjoyed just the activity and and uh i write software uh as far as the job and so getting getting out and being active uh is uh uh helps out the the it's a change the change the change of pace and just getting out and around and and i find that i can often you know often uh when i get around to doing it then i i feel better when i get back to work and the and uh yeah yeah i can see it'll be a good break right uh-huh uh also that that it my subconscious is working on things while i'm working and i i go back and i've got new ideas but but still yeah yeah i think you do you feel very good after you exercise i think it's worth making the time for yourself you owe it to yourself and i think you do accomplish more after that yeah yeah yeah and i think that it's just is good for your self esteem for everything because when you look better you feel better and it's just uh i think it's well worth it i just demand that time for myself now i've learned to do that and it you know and it i think it just benefits you all around yeah so yeah i think that's uh i i think that's a good term demanding demanding the time for yourself but you you've just got to you've just got to prioritize right you have to because there's always more things to do there is always things that you can make priority to it but i just i don't demand a lot for myself and so yeah you know i just feel entitled to it and i take it well good well good well uh so uh have you have you done any jogging i tell you said you you did on the on the bike and on the treadmill in the in the uh clubs no i've done some walking with friends in the past but i find that when you do that you do more chatting than you do exercise and that's not really beneficial um-hum yeah so uh yeah yeah i don't have time like that and i spend enough time chatting around everywhere you know and the phone  so what sort of car are you interested in getting next well actually i love the car i have i have a Chrysler LeBaron convertible ah and i love it and i would get another one in a minute unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red Ferrari or you know a little Corvette or something like that and that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car and i'd love an expensive one but i probably can never afford it so uh well i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles um i currently have an eighty seven five liter Mustang GT that i've done a bunch of modifications to to make it uh handle and perform better uh-huh and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was um the best car i could get regardless of money uh i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari uh-huh yeah well i'm a nurse here and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari a a three twenty eight GTS and i couldn't tell you but it's just beautiful and i go out and i love to touch it but i can't even do that because of the of the alarm so i just look at it a lot you just go hunting go out and lust after it really exactly but it sure is a pretty thing so have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari no i'm working on it no i really haven't no huh-uh oh i did test drive a Corvette last year maybe the year before it was brand new white it was like a big marshmallow when you sat in the seats they adjusted to fit around you ah i mean they came in and up and out and i mean they did whatever and and we went for a test drive in that and i was able to open that up pretty good and that was really fun and i wanted it but i had a choice of that or my house yeah there there's something about having a place to live i don't know and i felt that i should continue to live in my house so yeah you know it's just necessary and i did i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical could sleep in the back of the Vette yeah right so i find that uh that the Corvettes are are becoming really really nice cars they are they're pretty aren't they lately they really are yeah and they've they've improved the performance and the suspension such that they're actually a lot of fun to drive really it's not like driving a a Winnebago or something oh no no no see i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now and they go isn't that a nice van and i go hm not really you know how about a Greyhound bus uh nice yeah nice isn't the word i'd choose maybe practical isn't that a practical van yeah i mean that you know there's some that are prettier than others and yeah the new type is prettier than what their they used to look like but i sure don't think it's attractive you know it's not like like driving a little sports car yeah it's it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive yeah i don't think that happens so but i i love mine so and i i bought it because i drove a friend's in Hawaii and i just went home and i walked in and i picked it out and he said take it home and bring it back if you want to and i never did i just went back and signed the papers and i knew nothing about my car when i got it nothing i didn't know how anything worked oh so it was a completely new experience for you and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it yeah and i've had it it's almost three years actually and i've i still love it i put the top down everywhere i go i timed it when i first got it and it took twenty minutes i mean twenty seconds and so i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds right so and you and you couldn't get how long does it take to go back up about the same time twenty seconds yeah that's all it takes i mean it's just a button that's it you you release it right at the top so you don't have to get out or anything yeah so so you won't get yeah and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial well i did actually last week going to the airport i just hit a downpour and i was on a highway going like eighty so i really did i mean i was soaking wet i thought i would drown in the seconds that it took me to pull over whoops but it all dried out you know didn't take long when the sun came out but it was kind of funny i'm sure people around me really enjoyed it so yeah oh no i was just down in Austin last week and the weather was pretty nice too so oh and wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything yeah yeah with the bluebonnets out yeah it really was yeah i decided that Austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living yeah a lot of people say that and it's pretty far from where i live it's about hm two or three hours maybe two hundred  regarding uh taxes i'm you know taxes are really a necessary evil in in a civilized society but really people get upset at taxes because you it's more efficient to do things yourself right hm and uh and so as as a result uh you know it's it's a trade-off you know for the common good you know for for the benefit of others you know how much of your resource should you dedicate to uh making things work for others have you uh you know ever thought you know just how much of that money should should go to other people that really don't deserve it uh well yeah i know it's it's a lot you know that uh that i feel like you know just like you said that there's just so much that you can do yourself that you take care of your own self that you don't need the money for but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either either but yet they accept it well the thing of it is if i wanted to just uh you know permanently become a book reader i guess i could just uh you know uh go on public assistance uh you know look look look for uh look for people to uh take care of me and uh probably a good woman right like so many people do uh-huh right just you know just just con somebody to take care of me and and then you don't have to be on the tax roll right but uh but taxes are are very difficult kind of thing and everybody everybody really hates it it was very timely i i i always over pay my my deductions so i wind up with my getting money back on my uh from my uh withholding uh-huh so uh you know that that's always a smile but of course you know i've i've paid it in and i should calculate it better you are you in business for yourself no no i i i i work for the FBI okay i see so i i'm a federal employee yeah guess i don't sound like it huh right uh well i think i no i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as as everybody else you know most of them unless you work for Internal Revenue yeah i've blown yeah oh i i've got all four feet in a trough you know being a federal employee and and and so but but i can understand that uh that you know the uh who gets benefits like every every time there is a a bond issue yeah um-hum you know i vote no on every one of them right i'm i but this this is this is tax not tax revolt country i mean there's too many every one of us most of us have our have all four feet in the trough you know plus our snout right up to our ears yeah so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation right but uh um the um the local taxes here i i in in this particular area um you know i've uh i think i pay about uh oh thirty five hundred for for taxes on my four bedroom house you know and which is a lot of money and and uh and so as as people get older and older uh you know they think about retirement and that sort of thing and right um-hum and they they're building old peoples homes uh you know at tax expense sell i think you know the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper at thirty three hundred dollars at or thirty five hundred dollars i'm paying in taxes why i i i could go down to Bulverde and probably rent a rent a house for that right yeah that's right for you know instead instead it's it's the taxes here so course i don't know whether i wanna go to Bulverde or not yeah yeah or Seguin or someplace like that yeah but uh there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer and and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer if you're not gonna use them then you wanna be in in an environment that's a strategy i think that that the people have to have to take is is how to be able to to lessen their cost of living you know and i'm i'm five six away years before i'm eligible to retire and and i'm saying well you know i really can't stay here uh as a retiree it's too expensive after you retire yeah yeah yeah i'm gonna have go out in and you know in you know East Fork someplace and and do my thing you know right oh my parents are in the same situation you know they their home is paid for but still their taxes are so high that you know my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay the taxes and they have no children in school or you know anything now they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards right they they redecorated in nineteen seventy five you know and they're not doing it again again you know so well it's certainly uh uh you must be a TI employee uh yeah yeah you must be what you must be a TI employee no i'm not no i i don't work i'm a student i go to school i'm in nursing school you're not a TI employee who do you work for you're  i'm ready if you are okay um where uh where do you stand uh well i think that people should be allowed to have them especially if they go hunting which my son goes hunting he goes deer hunting he goes duck hunting on oh you uh he's read books about guns since he was like probably eleven or twelve years old um-hum um-hum and i just think that uh as far as that's concerned he should be able to have them to go hunting with you know as far as just having handguns around to right right to have them i don't believe that you should have handguns around right yeah yeah yeah i agree too i um it's it's as far as uh the ban goes and everything i don't think it's possible uh to completely ban guns there's just too many well no there's too many sports people out there that that do do these things right and i yeah right i mean yeah that that's true and i mean the the technology's not that hard i mean you could make a gun you know from simple you know yeah well i suppose you could uh you know if if you really wanted a gun you could you could make one um um-hum and i think if they want one they're going to get one you know oh yeah sure that's true the bad guys are you know like i say if they want a gun they're going to find out or somehow to get one um-hum yeah yeah it's yeah i mean there's yeah there's there's no way to stop uh stop anybody from getting a gun um i think there should be more control as like uh like maybe waiting periods and things like that you know uh well i agree with you on that because i know uh in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a Christmas present one time and for a rifle there's no waiting there wasn't anyhow now there might be now um-hum yeah but there wasn't anything for you know rifles and things like that i guess it was just handguns that there was a some kind of a waiting you know a two weeks while they checked you out or something um-hum sure yeah right but uh most of these people that's got these guns that's going around you know robbing people and shooting people um-hum yeah uh i i know my friend is uh really into guns and uh uh we have went a couple of times with him to gun shows you know they come through town and everything and i mean they just have i mean they have anything you'd want i mean you know you know uh you know anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and um-hum um-hum and there's i mean there's nothing you can just go buy one and take it home and you know it's easier than getting uh like a video membership card at you know a video store yeah i i see now i know they were having a gun show uh about a month ago and i was just wondering how that did work if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show uh yeah yeah you just go and uh buy the gun and uh there's no restriction though you don't have to wait or nothing then huh no well except for the the pistols and i i'm not sure how they do that i know they used yeah i was just curious you know because uh i know at at the regular gun show you know gun shop that you that you do have to wait for pistols like a couple of weeks and then they check you out then they call you up and you have go pick it up um-hum um-hum right yeah i think that's which i think they have to do on rifles and things now too i think there is something something like that anyhow here out here in California i think there is now but um-hum yeah yeah i'm not sure i'm not really sure but what uh the the gun laws in uh Pennsylvania Pennsylvania are like um-hum no we don't have guns because we don't go hunting or anything like that but like i say my son he's no um-hum he's always had a like a i think his first little rifle we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old um-hum but he's always he went to the to the school to learn how to shoot it he goes to the pistol range and uh and the rifle range to shoot them he likes to go to that uh shotgun thing where you shoot at those um oh yeah the skeets you mean yeah right he likes to do that you know but uh um-hum yeah i don't know i think they should try to control it and everything you know but as far as just banning it completely there that's not going to happen i don't yeah i don't i don't think it can happen either it i just don't i don't see and i i think uh hadn't thought about this before but if you do that if they would uh um-hum uh decide to ban guns it would just open up a a market you know a black market for them yeah right right and so you know they they would just all the profits would go to you know now i do believe though like in California if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has i think they're liable now for it yeah oh the they can be you know put in jail and everything the whoever owned the gun oh the owner's responsibility yeah you know now when they have kids around you'd think that they would be locking them up or you know yeah yeah yeah that's that's true um you know i had i had a friend who was a uh a policeman in a in a in a local borough just a small uh one of the little neighborhoods you know one of the small towns uh near Pittsburgh and uh she said that uh um-hum you know he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that but i mean you know you're you know people make you know they forget or you know you know kids get in the way kids the way kids are you know i mean they can you know well they can get into almost anything anymore right yeah  i don't know what you drive now i mean what do you drive now uh i have a Ford pickup and uh the family car is a uh a Dodge uh Caravan and uh because we have three kids and they're under thirteen oh okay so um throw them in the back they sort of fit our requirement yeah i have a one of those uh pickups with the uh cap seat with a seat in the back oh yeah and so they just fit in there when they get to be teenagers with long legs it may not work but right now i can right now i can throw them all in the back when we have room and uh there you go and since i do a lot of projects i throw things in the back and i kind of like having a pickup truck actually i think of it as a as a car that'll last yeah you're right yeah i know i i like the way trucks are built and i don't care about comfort so i'm pretty happy yeah you're looking at i got a Toyota Four Runner i wanted a truck that i i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too so i got a Four Runner yeah so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one i i never buy new so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck you're just like me i've never bought a new vehicle in my life and uh yeah i don't i don't i don't need to pay for the glitz i'll let somebody else uh have the showroom shine enough and i'll pay for the rest of it no let somebody else break it in right right and uh the van we're sort sort of we might go again on a on a van uh we we could probably do with a a something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time i'm not sure yeah we have to we we'll have to face it in a couple of years but uh i i guess we had a small Toyota wagon right and we were real happy with that because uh my my second requirement after price is uh low maintenance and uh right that it certainly had that we didn't do much to it at all so yeah my my the pretty much the same i i got a like i said i got one of those Toyota Four Runners um-hum and uh it pretty much does everything i need it to i mean it it'll tow three thousand pounds so i can tow everything and it i can throw i've had eleven people in it before uh-huh believe it or not and uh it's real reliable believe i i mean i've had it for almost four years now and up until oh say two weeks ago it had never had anything wrong with it uh-huh and then of course two weeks ago it decided i don't know it's the strangest weirdest thing in the world but it blew a head gasket uh-oh didn't do any damage to it um i caught it real early uh-huh at how many at how many miles um oh ninety seven thousand so it's not real early huh and you didn't overheat it no never overheated it i smell i smelled the uh i smelled the coolant uh-huh went out and looked saw it was coming saw where it was coming from drove it right to the shop and left it off huh well that was minimum and that was it because i i have that and then i have a a Kawasaki motorcycle uh-huh which is actually the usually my preferred mode of transportation if i can take it and it's not raining yeah i mean that's that's sort of my hobby though more than a vehicle it it's a i don't know people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves i have one colleague that uh commutes to work on one when it's not raining and uh uh he's a it's he's pretty conservative guy i don't think it's much of a sport for him i guess uh i know but i bet you he really enjoys riding it i'm sure he does yeah yeah so you know you how when was the last time you took out took your truck out just to just to go driving yeah no and i go out twice a week on the bike so at least just for the enjoyment yeah it's like yeah but yeah i i mean the only thing i think i might get in a new car or not necessarily a new car but a another car um i would consider going to a a non to a normal pickup rather than a a covered pickup like the one i got just because there's a lot of times i wished i had the uh just an open bed to throw stuff in right yeah i'm sure i'm sure that that's very i mean you got one it's that's really convenient just be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back and if i only had some place that i could store the uh camper top i would have it off most of the time right i really leave it on there just for just to have it out of the way because it put it on the ground it gets dirty and to have have it out of the way right but uh yeah they're solid uh trucks are built uh i mean i think they last a lot longer than anything else they're the only things Americans still know how to build and uh yeah yeah the trucks do um even though you know the Jap the little Jap trucks are are good there too but so are the though i think the Chevys i don't think the Chevy i don't like the Chevys as much as i like the Fords yeah i think they i think the Fords tend to last a little longer least until recently right i kind of like mine yeah so mine's a Ford and uh a friend of mine just bought or bought like a year ago it's it's a really a nice truck i mean i don't like Dodges at all but one of the Dodges they have out now has a uh the Cummins turbo diesel in it oh i heard about that yes ah it's beautiful that thing that thing will last forever i mean yeah that's the that's a serious truck oh yeah that thing's uh that it's got a boat engine in it right this uh i i know a contractor who just got one of those and he's pleased with it uh-huh  think about this uh do you have children in school um i have two that are uh now just about ready to graduate from college but i also have two that are just entering school um i do oh so you see a big difference then in before and now do you or uh well uh i think they're just pushing them much entirely to fast a lot of testing um well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock uh-huh um-hum and i think that's such a long day for a kindergartner i do too i oh i think that's awful and uh i have a preschooler um i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten and i thought well how mature do you have to be i know really what's the new criteria huh and uh there is a do you have the standardized testing now we have all kinds of testing and it's over and over it's ITBS or and uh just everything everything and they test test test i live in Plano actually and yeah i don't know if you've heard of Plano but it's a very transient community a lot of people from everywhere it's just north of Dallas no um-hum and it's grown in leaps and bounds i we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now and most of them from other places oh yeah uh JC Penney's come down from New York and of course TI and Xerox from Rochester and we just have lots of people from everywhere lots of industry coming in and it's a very wealthy community yeah uh not that i am but other people seem to be and i would love to know why but i mean they do they have i i would i really would i mean they just have beautiful beautiful homes and they have everything yeah you'd like to know what they're doing right the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things well it does you know it really does because i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um oh me well that makes it hard for you doesn't it oh me yeah it's hard to explain to them why you can't not to where she feels different but some of them are very rich and so um we just kind of have everything here and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are right and so i don't know how much of it is us and how much of it is Texas but the kids are expected to excel in everything oh dear and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first and they're expected to be you know their parents expect it right the teachers expect it Texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system and if you read national surveys they're far from it right and so there's just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests and how about the kids how are they coping with it well not very well they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep and eat right in the morning before tests i mean they make a big deal to me the paper should just be put on the desk that day and say just do this hum right you know i just feel they do better that way and yeah and and i have older children too that now are out of high school and yeah rather than anticipating uh they've always done this you know i mean it's always been the same but it is it's getting worse and worse there's more pressure for everything and i just think it's really awful and i i'm with you on that you don't hear too many people say this but i think it's a very long day oh it is and my feeling is that you you know you're only a kid once and you don't wanna spend your whole life in school that's right my son said that came home and he said he said mom all we do is work we hardly ever play and um-hum um-hum and i don't think that's right i think we should do what Europe does and include cultural activities in our school system oh likewise i don't think i should have to pay for dancing lessons gymnastics piano i would like to see those things included in our school system because i think we should have well rounded kids right wouldn't that be great um-hum not just smart book smart kids right and so i just find this a real problem i think if they're gonna be there all day they should find time one of my daughters once was out of school with Mono in her junior year i think it was and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week and when she went back in six weeks she was ahead is that right oh my gosh so what does that tell you the it tells you there's a whole lot of wasted time oh my gosh and they could be using this time better well for example in my son's kindergarten they're really finished at lunch time after lunch they have some uh i'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch and then they have naps or rest period uh-huh and uh i think either send them home or do something that's a very long day for kindergarten but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this a little more interesting i agree i wouldn't be surprised you know because they don't they don't wanna send them to day care i doubt if they would say that it was too long that's why they want them there because then somebody takes care of them all day so the um do you have the before school care at your school and the after school care we have them at some one school like  i don't know if you feel the same but uh when it comes to telling kids that they have to do uh two or three years of service into some kind of community i don't know if that's uh appropriate for a government to suggest that and say you know you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen or you know in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do right and um i as far as a high school course i could see it as uh maybe a social uh sociology course to where a student would get credits if they were to be involved with some kind of community type of program um-hum um-hum and to me that's fine to have a student do that for like four or even a year but to tell them that they had to do two years there after post high school of community service i'm um-hum i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do hum well that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it'd be more on a voluntary basis as opposed to uh mandatory um-hum exactly yeah and yeah i kind of agree with that um i don't think you know it it they shouldn't have they should have the same rights as anyone else right right you know it shouldn't be uh anything shouldn't be mandatory other than i guess like uh when you come to paying taxes or something like that uh or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe uh people be more eagle to do it uh-huh yeah um-hum exactly and doing it for a purpose that they want the other thing is this i have thought about this and many times when you get these uh young troubled teenagers that uh don't have like the perspective of uh of of the community a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems but there are other people out in the community that may have problems then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing you have to do so much as far as in a community service now if they were you know the abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse right um-hum or if uh they destroyed some property around the uh area then they would have to do uh to restore it and perhaps um work um for the community to beautify it or whatever but um-hum i could see that working in you know cases where the it might be young teenagers getting in trouble with law and teaching him that there is a whole community that is is effected when they strike out and do their crimes or whatever and that's i think they have done that and judges have said well you know this is what you're gonna get for um you know a misdemeanor misdemeanor or something you may end up having to do some kind of community service so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled um-hum so uh that's a good idea uh i think they should have more programs like that um-hum and i think uh us being taxpayers we pay for people that's in jail or in trouble anyway um-hum sure we sure do so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas um-hum yeah and i i agree wholeheartedly yeah yeah but uh the thing is that it's not enough of that kind of stuff going on uh yeah because you like you say it's a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors why why have someone in your jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor um-hum and sometimes you know putting them in jail it doesn't really help um-hum because there's nothing in there that to rebil rebilitate rehabilitate rebilihatate them and then when they get out they because they have the stigmatism of being in jail they can't exactly yeah um-hum and there's a lot of anger sure you know especially if they haven't went through treatment and they dealt with other people in the uh system of prisons which um you you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever i would say the crimes would probably be you know if you went in for a certain crime there might somebody that has has done a crime even worse than what you have so you're dealing with people um that may uh be an influence later on and uh an issue of anger would be is that i went to prison for a year or two but i didn't get any rehabilitation or um um-hum you know but then again those that have physically assaulted somebody um that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in the community if they're of a violent sort and to say well you have to um-hum right  capital punishment uh i guess out in California has has had a lot of uh a lot of you know discourse in the paper uh apparently uh there's they haven't uh executed anybody since nineteen sixty seven i believe um yeah that's that's far back as i can remember well that's before my time actually yeah they a well i we were we uh we just started we we lived in Redwood City when we were out there um-hum and uh and we found that uh you know it was a very liberal kind of community but uh i i i really feel that the that the law enforcement community uh you know puts these people behind bars and then they they uh uh you know the lawyers these lawyer groups get together and they uh they i think extend beyond the normal uh appeal process uh you know and just drag these this guy uh his his uh ultimate uh demise out for ten or fifteen years uh and i i think that uh that there there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that i i think capital punishment uh uh laws are probably stringent enough but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way um-hum do do you feel as though there should be uh more uh laws or or more uh you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by uh by uh uh capital punishment well i think that currently the the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself it's it's to the point where they're saying like here you're you're going on death row but you'll stay there for twenty years and nothing's being done about it um the laws exist and too many times they're frequently upheld in in um um-hum in in Appeals Court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find and it's it's really getting out of hanters in most many states well the term technicality the the the law enforcement community uh uh you know has to has to separate the difference between somebody who is being set up in which uh griedous acts are done to uh to you know get somebody into a a situation where they're gonna be guilty of of a crime or whether uh and and whether the rights of that individual are been have been you know impugned um but or whether there's just you know a policeman has just made a uh uh you know a a non a non critical error error though be it not the right way to do it but but you know the the merits of the case in terms of you know the guy was a law breaker is being supported now i i'm at at at this juncture i you know i'm i'm not sure you know what constitutes a a technicality you know that that's what all these these hearings are about and that's what all these you know court cases are about i mean our uh our our glorious uh you know mayor here in Washington is six days away from getting out of uh out of uh the can and uh you know he he tried to appeal his conviction uh and you know it didn't work but be that as it may everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry um in in the old days you know and say round about times of Battle of Hastings you know and that villages villages if you were a transgressor they they either you know drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody and he were you were his slave and if he didn't like what you did he killed you and that has that's pretty effective uh you know it's not good for civil rights i guess but it's pretty effective in that you know you've got to get along in the community and if you don't you will perish either by the hand of your your your master or by being pushed out in the woods so i i i mean as as man has gotten more complicated so all of the uh machinations to uh you know protect him from from being uh dumped on by uh civilian authority in in in some in criminal actions especially you know murder cases and that sort of thing well it seems like well it it seems as if in the past um typically there have been a lot a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished and the whole the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't commit the crimes all be it it seems that we are failing in that in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who who are guilty are getting off um for instance um there's a case a few years back where um someone um someone who's being convicted for was under a trial was going to trial for murder was let off because of a technicality that the officer the arresting officer um did not read the defendant their rights um-hum and where as all the evidence was there the witnesses were there the everything everything was conclusively pointing to this individual yet  um i don't know about you but uh i work outside the home and uh in fact uh i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work and i work different shifts so are pretty much a a later shift to where i don't have the family time uh when my husband gets home it's usually he's home with my daughter alone and then uh couple of hours later i'm home um i don't know i'm finding that more and more people that i talk to there's less and less family time available to them and uh it seems that business wise um in the business community or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family so you know if you do have any time it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done um just just to maintain your home and maintain the things outside your home and then plus try to have that relationship with your children and it it's sometimes a very it's a it's a very hard juggling act i agree and you know i look at my daughter and she's now uh four going to be four and i keep saying oh jeez i don't have that much time with her yeah and she's growing fast and i know that i have three children and um i stay home i don't work um-hum uh-huh and um i know that it it must be really challenging to um try to juggle a job and and also your children because i know my husband if i were gone as much as he is yeah we wouldn't have the influence on them that i would wanna put on them yeah sure exactly and i also notice that the children that come over here to play that go to day care every day um-hum uh-huh they don't like to be around adults uh-huh they don't wanna play around adults they don't want to be around you they don't want you to tell them what to do they want to do their own thing and they're the very same age as my children sure um-hum exactly and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school i just a being um i'm not educated at all in um really detecting this but i can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks which kids go to day care and which kids stay home um-hum sure sure and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults that um the ones that are are home and the ones even that are home that are getting the love and attention they need um-hum not that the kids that go out aren't getting that it's just a different they're they are more used to being with their own age kids they're not use to being with adults and to responding to adults yeah yeah sure sure sure yeah i agree to a um i think the trend in the United States i feel really bad that it's turned so much to where the children are um i think so too in fact um i spent the first three years at home with my daughter so i i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in day care and i thought to myself how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks whatever the employer says you have to be back to work is basically when you have to be back to work whether it be six weeks or three or four but how these women must feel to place their children into care and you know it's our society saying yes this um you need this job it's a little bit financial type thing because uh if you look all over in the other countries like Europe and that um their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are and that's part of it too but right uh like my husband was saying maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves is that these women back in the nineteen fifties uh were staying at home with their kids and then made the decision well jeez you know i'll go out and get a part time job got a part time job and then financially they got themselves into well i'll have the boat i'll have the car and it's nice right and really women past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too uh because it is now our financial situations are as it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now and it's hard it really is hard i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of sacrificing to keep me home and um um-hum sure i did it for three years and uh it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it and pretty soon you know you're at the limit where you've got to say okay you've sacrificed for you know so many years at home and you're not getting any further you know along right and you have to make that decision to go back to work part time or go back to work full time and you have to make that decision and it's a tough one and i right i think one of the things that people look at too though is um spending how they spend their time with their children um-hum i think with working moms if you can get the managers the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with year round school where you work sure  well mine is very very simple i'm a nurse i wear white or i wear scrubs so i guess you'll have to carry this one uh-huh you're all set then oh geez i i'm a teacher and uh basically what we do is we dress for the weather especially the climates inside the school isn't it different it is different isn't it inside than not so much they climates out uh my daughter says that too that it's freezing when they turn on the air conditioning and it's so hot when they turn on the heat it is it's unbelievable usually we layer our clothing uh-huh and um that way we have you know we can strip off layers and not so much our pants but you wear a sweater and a short sleeve shirt underneath that yeah and then you can take the sweater off yeah or something that's medium weight and especially up here we get the you know we get winters and it's really cold and sometimes in the classrooms it's really cold too right yeah so sometimes you just leave your jackets on all the time gosh you know so yeah it's probably pays pays for you to leave something there do you do you do that um not that often because a lot of things get stolen really oh great so it's mostly what you wear into work you know wear a short sleeve shirt or a short sleeve blouse yeah and a sweater if you're wearing slacks and if you're wearing a over the dress you wear a sweater you know a cardigan or something over the dress and um you know bring your jacket you can just carry it around with you yeah you can wear socks to work there yes we can and yeah our teachers can't do that yet um-hum well we have a really big high school so it's you know it gets very uncomfortable on hills uh-huh most the teachers have taking to wearing uh track shoes oh the nurses have too that's interesting a lot of them are wearing Reebok's now because most of them the prefer the pants to the dresses you know sneakers and uh-huh and with the scrubs too you know which is just you know scrubs are like what they wear in the O R and i right they just wear Reebok's it's really comfortable i haven't done it yet no but it's probably coming because we're all going into scrubs right now it depends on the area where you work they're great right but soon the whole area is going into scrubs and so um-hum oh really so probably i'll go ahead and break down and you know i guess i guess from the school this is just not professional you know so i'm kind of a hold out oh that happens a lot i know my aunt was director she just retired was director of nurses at the hospital up here yeah and she always wore a cap and oh oh yeah she was like a real hold out oh boy and then finally she took that off and that was like big concession on her part oh and then she went to her hospital you know her uniform and she always wore her you know uniform shoes never wore sneakers yeah yeah she absolutely refused yeah and i still do that and they're very expensive they are comfortable though i i don't know i yeah that's what she was saying one thing i've noticed that's come back here are clogs really yeah they started to make a come back you see them in the stores more and more and i didn't think i'd ever see those again oh i know it well in California they have these oh gosh i can't think of the name of them they have a name they come from Italy and they're cork uh-huh and they have like two straps on top like a sandal and they form to fit your feet oh neat they're soft and after you wear them a day then they only fit your feet oh that sounds great and they're wearing those and i've seen a little bit of it in the stores here now really but i don't know being up there if you'll see too much they wouldn't be very practical except in the summer time um-hum but um yeah that's the new thing and it's sort of on that style you know except that it's open like a sandal right a lot of us during the winter would wear boots and then peel them off and carry our shoes yeah yeah yeah you know or just wear the shoes in and hope for the best yeah really hum things have plowed pretty well i'm not used to that anymore i came down here from New York but oh really yes i remember boots and things like that but not anymore uh-huh yeah my parents just came up from Florida and they had to get rid of all their a lot of their summer summer clothes yeah and they say my gosh one minute it's eighty and the next minute it's you know sixty and they're freezing and they said oh what and they say wait a minute we had a mild winter this year really really oh oh wait till next year uh well hopefully we seem to be running on mild winters lately they weather's changing all over the country yeah we're getting a lot more rain and ice than we are snow hum and uh that makes it difficult on as far as clothing goes because you don't know what to put on your feet yeah oh yeah yeah yeah i don't think anyone in Texas owns  now um we're driving a nineteen eighty five uh Buick Park Avenue that's still on the road you must have a family yeah it's uh it it's an interesting car with all sorts of problems that crop up now that it's in it's seventh year um-hum and uh like anytime anything happens it's immediately five hundred dollar repair or ooh what have you so i uh you know in looking for the next car that we get here we're gonna look for something that has a very good track record that right isn't going to cost us a bundle every time something goes wrong well i can tell you about reliability the last two cars i've had have both been Honda Accords and uh i mean it's probably it's not a huge car but it's been very reliable and uh i was just very impressed by it uh when i first looked at it and when i talked to other people that had Hondas they cost a little more and when i was looking for them the dealer just wouldn't negotiate at all because they're such a big demand but it had all the features i needed the uh you know the power and the uh adjustability and power windows and things like that and the dashboard just looked good to me it was just no nonsense had the the speedometer uh speedometer and the tach and the couple of other little gauges like engine heat but none of the you know big flashy electronic stuff yeah i i've continually i've come to learn in having this car that it was fully loaded when we got it and the problem is it's the fully loaded gives the car more chances for things to go wrong um-hum uh-huh that make it not drivable and i'd heard good things about the Hondas uh especially the Accord um but uh you know we've been we've been we've been an American car family for the most part for um a long time not because of any great desire to like wow we're just going to buy American because it's American that's right but but i don't know it's just been traditional type of uh General Motors type of car the last car we had was a um um a Grand Prix which never again um-hum that was a nightmare that one that i mean the thing just literally fell apart as time went on God well it's well if you like American cars it's a good thing that they're getting better i'll tell you that you yeah it's it's been you know the the Park Avenue this year that's come out you know being a very high end type car uh they put a lot into it this year but the one in eighty five um-hum apparently was a problem year for them because they you know what's happened is most people have just gotten rid of them as soon as you know they pass the three year mark and things start going they go and buy a new car right well with the Northeast and the recession up here yeah you know that's certainly not an easy option and uh we've kind of stuck with it trying to keep it you know we figure sooner or later we'll probably replace everything on the silly thing and maybe it'll work right then huh yeah i know know then when one of the doors fall off then it's time to get a new car you know great yeah well Chrysler is supposed to be when if you're looking at reliability Chrysler's supposed to be one of the best American cars right now and the American cars the uh one advantage one advantage one big advantage they still have is you can typically find them for a lot less yeah so anyway but uh some of the other things i like about well some of the things i don't like usually are um the flashy stuff you know the all the doors lock when you do something or uh um yeah i used to now i'm getting more to where i think i might like a a sun roof on my next car um-hum i'm not really sure about that because i'm very much a person who uh likes to drive around with every with all the windows closed and the air conditioning on so i can hear my stereo well but you know so a sun roof or or a tee top or something like that you're just going to have to crank the stereo up to compete with the wind noise well you're in a climate that's a little bit more where you have need the air conditioning more than we do up here you bet they don't sell any cars down here without it you know yeah see up here it's it's definitely definitely an option type thing because we only have about three months of really hot weather um-hum everything else is fairly moderate then we have the world famous Rochester slash Buffalo winters so a sun roof is really a snow roof you know ooh look snow yeah great i mean i think what else you're going to see you know looking up at your doom as the snow comes pummeling down but uh-huh oh no well that's the other thing is a car needs to be able to handle the salt up here that they pour on the roads that's right right and that's what kills cars up here is you know the salt rusts them out and then they die years before you you know a car from California might be undrivable right or or they they die of rust years before their major systems would otherwise go out yeah that's that's what happened basically to our last car i mean it just this rust took over and  i'm ready well in Atlanta Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson California oh could could be uh this little city is only about eight thousand people um so oh yeah we is is crime a problem there do you like a major problem minor problem or well in Patterson there's it's not a problem here but like uh i lived in Oakland uh until just recently um-hum and uh Oakland California God they've had like uh sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like uh forty at this time last year yeah so it's really bad there it's all related to drugs it seems like yeah oh yeah is that what it's there too yeah um i've only been here for like oh probably just over six months i started started school here uh-huh um i came from a smaller town in in New York and crime the city was fairly big size or not real big but we had a problem there but here it's just no comparison that much more crime uh um-hum um-hum every every night the news is very depressing because it just you know they run down the list of how many people were shot you know drive by shootings or yeah whatever and it's it's it's pretty bad they're they're it's things are basically improved here over the last few years they've the they've actually taken steps to try to make it better but it still it still is a problem yeah Like i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen well that's that seemed to be what they were doing and it has and they've started stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has has made some places safer but you you know it's very difficult i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could uh-huh um-hum um-hum as it is a is definitely a problem and you know the more it more less that's done about it the more it seems it tends to spread even to smaller areas unfortunately um-hum yeah well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know then then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things you know right yeah i think i think uh it's uh seems to be that i don't know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five and they're back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just cyclical cyclical cyclical and it seems seems as though the the system doesn't tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done yeah i just don't understand our our laws here because you know like in other countries man i mean they're really a lot stricker than we are yeah it's it's definitely true it seems seems as though we we try to play humanitarian i think to a little to much and maybe some of the people don't deserve the the humanitarian treatment that they get um-hum um-hum unfortunately but i don't know it's a difficult situation i think and some something has to be done because i definitely think it's it it really plays reeks havoc with uh your quality of life when you know you can see it's going on around you but then when once it finally affects you then then it really starts to bother you um-hum um-hum um but it seems i mean it people move like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but you know it's only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them you can't really run away from the problem yeah and something you know something has to be done but it's just that too many people argue about how to fix it yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of of the city by myself oh sure and uh and then then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark right you know right but down here in Patterson well like i say it's so small that you can go anywhere yeah yeah that's good but just uh like twenty miles away see in Modesto they have uh those gangs and things over there right and it's it's bad in Sacramento also they have uh drive by shootings it seems like all the time yeah so i don't know i just i just don't know what what they can do you know yeah yeah it's it's to bad because it's um i mean the just the even the random occurrences where you know it's unsafe for a woman just to walk from their car to the some in certain areas like from from the car from their car to the mall or something and it's dangerous and it's just that's just ridiculous and i know you know it's just uh it's just not right something you know yeah i mean like even even going to the grocery store i know we've had this one lady that was attacked you know i mean just uh you just you just don't know what to do anymore you know right right right and some of the times it's happening in the daytime too you know so it's not always happening at dark yeah so i don't know yeah it's uh definitely unfortunate unfortunate and it just  think is wrong with the public school system is that i think we've lately in the last twenty years or so kind of lost focus with the basics uh in order to go into this sort of specialized curriculum where uh we're teaching kids not a broad base of subjects but rather trying to concentrate them on particular subject areas that they think they might be interested in going into a career uh about and the problem comes about if these people aren't well rounded students or graduates that that sort of traps them in the field that they've spent all this time being educated in i think there's something to that yeah yeah i tend to agree uh well i remember now it's been quite a few years since my kids were in high school i'm getting that old but uh i remember uh being a little surprised at the uh the catalog of courses like instead of taking a survey course on American Literature you had you chose from uh it almost looked like a college catalog uh-huh and uh the courses were too specialized as you said and you just read you know they they take a whole semester long course on uh on one writer or something uh that's fine for college but it seems kind of silly for high school yeah that's it's i'm only twenty four years old so i've was through a lot of that uh although you'd be about the same age as my sons yeah well in my luckily up here the school system up here was intelligent enough that they didn't want to get that focused and they drilled into our heads and the same thing with the college that i went to to get as broad of an education as possible so that you're down with the basics and then once you know what you want to do then try and uh get some specific courses but i remember one of the things that they were always drilling into us was the need to learn how to communicate effectively through writing um uh-huh and i i constantly come up against some of the writings being involved in uh computers and the like where i see other people writing and it's embarrassing you know it's some of these things that and i've seen papers that in sixth grade i wouldn't have had returned uh to me which are getting A's in college today the standards have really fallen uh-huh yeah yeah i taught college for awhile not recently but uh yeah i remember i i was quite surprised at uh i mean you start rejecting things on that basis you end up handing uh everybody's papers back that's probably what we should have done huh yeah it it the only way that i ever you know i i took Comp journalism as a major and uh the writing they what they would do is they would focus in on our particular problems well on the college level course and uh uh-huh uh would then work with us as far as fixing those things i had a problem with uh writing excessive verbiage uh-huh uh in my writing and i they taught me basically how to pair it down a little bit and i i don't see that in a broader you know even in a public school uh situation because a lot of the teachers have these large classes that they can't devote the individual attention to each student that they may have twenty or thirty years ago uh-huh yeah i suppose i guess the class sizes are bigger now i guess they must be i remember large group in certain uh courses mainly Political Science we'd have lectures where there'd be three hundred students uh-huh and if you had a question you know or or didn't understand it at all of course you're not going to raise your hand in a three hundred group no thing and say i don't know what you're talking about they're going to just keep their mouth shut right they need smaller discussion and i think you know it's those kinds of things that i i'm not sure how we go about fixing something like that other than maybe devoting some more uh uh resources into first of all getting uh the uh teachers reasonable salaries and uh expecting in return some sort of standard standard and uh you know some proof that what they're doing is actually worth what we want to pay them yeah and then try and get maybe more involvement with the parents a lot of parents expect the schools to just take care of their kids and uh you know you you it's your job not mine uh-huh well i've been reading about some successful school systems and it does seem that parental involvement is the is the common uh factor and everybody's doing anything that works these days so that's probably uh one of the big keys well how are the schools down in your area these days well actually they're pretty good uh i i used to live in Wisconsin i only moved to Texas about four years ago but uh  well i'm are you there yes yes okay i'm sure that i probably um prescribe to different magazines ones that you do i take Doll Reader and Doll World because different set because i collect dolls um i also take Better Homes and Gardens um-hum i like that and then uh my husband he just uh subscribed to a wood he just started a woodwork so he just sent away to get some woodworking books oh so what kind do you uh get you know well i have a bunch of computer journals because i'm in computer science but beyond that uh lately i've been reading i've always liked the New Yorker uh-huh uh-huh and lately i've been picking up some of the travel uh both trade magazines and just the general travel magazines uh-huh um trying to keep up on what's going on is it and my wife also gets a lot of the food magazines Bon Appetite and Food and Wine and Gourmet yeah i used to take that right yeah and she and she still likes to get Time yeah which i've never liked very much but she seems to yeah i don't i if i you know if if i happen to find it i'll go ahead and read it someplace you know if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that but other than that i never i never liked that really do you read a newspaper i read my newspaper i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper to get here yeah you know so i do like to read the newspaper um and even this little newspaper that Patterson puts out in fact it it puts it out on Tuesdays and Thursdays i can hardly wait to get that to get the local news but uh other than that magazines i don't know there's so much advertising in them anymore some of them i used to get for the advertising like Byte magazine which is uh oh okay one of the larger computer ones i haven't bought it now for about eight years but when i used to get it it was about five hundred pages about three hundred of them advertising um-hum huh because that was interesting i think a lot of the trade magazines are like that um-hum um-hum that that half the fun is finding out what all the products are um-hum um-hum but you know some of the get ridiculous Travel and Leisure all of the American Express magazines um-hum so Travel and Leisure Food and Wine and i think they have some others uh certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for and it is it's clear that i i've bought some of these through wholesalers and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription they're making everything on ads yeah right right yeah well i i only you know subscribe to the things that i'm interested in i used to be into coin collecting so i used to get the coin magazine the paper actually is what it was you know i used to get that so now that i'm into dolls that's about um-hum all i really really want you know have you ever um read or subscribe to Consumer Reports for any length of time no huh-uh um i think they're interesting but not worth it yeah i i've always had this one of the reasons i like to to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective so um-hum i've always had this problem with Consumer Reports that in the areas that i know a lot about i disagree with them um-hum and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything or or what's going on uh-huh so i've like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent uh organization magazines and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective um you know their major interest is in commissions and you know there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines their major talk is about you know commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not a the full ten percent or whatever it is and um-hum it gives you a different perspective on what people do um-hum um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or yeah uh some of them the the general travel magazines do i don't tend to read it for that um-hum because i don't expect to be traveling overseas in in the future for quite awhile but i i usually just read through the sections on on domestic stuff um-hum um-hum um-hum okay well i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about um i don't take anymore than that no yeah i don't take in much more in myself you know so okay well i guess that will be it then and okay nice talking to you  okay uh we keep a monthly budget i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids so we keep a a monthly budget and we try to stick to it i know it's really it's really difficult here all because there's always something breaking car needs tires or you know something yeah yeah that's that's the kind of things that throw you off uh uh we we do ours more monthly than long range um we uh my husband gets paid once a month and when he gets paid i pay all the bills uh-huh um-hum and out of his check they take a savings and out of my check they take savings uh-huh and retirement both out of both checks so as far as extra savings we really don't have that much extra to save um yeah yeah his check once a month pays all the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing and it works out real well that way so we don't run into a lot of problems oh how nice yeah yeah yeah but budgets are horrible well i know we do my husband gets paid twice a week and so we pay all of the little bills uh one paycheck and then like the mortgage and the electric bill you know those big bills the second uh-huh yeah second pay and then um again he does have a savings that comes out you know for Christmas and stuff that kind of thing yeah yeah when the car insurance is due and you call the credit union and tell them well send me some money yeah that kind of thing yeah it uh it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings but it's nice that's there you know but we do yeah it i'm just glad that it is there for car insurance medical bills whatever happen but uh yeah yeah yeah it's nice that it's there i know but i you it's just really is difficult uh neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years yeah and of course the cost of living keeps going up so my groceries are outrageous and i keep saying my check does less and less but yeah yeah yeah that's kind of how i felt when i was working because it seemed like we spent more we bought more things and it seemed like we spent more then a lot of it was going to uh day care and that kind of thing um-hum yeah so it just seems like with me staying home we had that big cut but we save more i don't know how and i don't know why but we it seems like we do well i uh i know that since i do work i buy a lot of quicker cuts of meat and uh well the frozen things for the microwave and things like that and i'll stop by the deli and pick up yeah yeah you kind of try and buy bigger quantities uh chicken or whatever where if i did not work i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot a lot uh better yeah that's how i felt too it just you could take a little longer and just watch a little bit more i guess yeah well you i guess that's kind of like the way we do we i i don't i don't know how it comes it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas where i was working well i'm sure you do um i do not well i do not have to pay child care during the winter my son's old enough that he likes to come home oh uh from school but in the summer he's still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself so in the summer i have that extra and ours is seventy dollars a week plus yeah all activities and that's usually movies one day skating on day swimming one day yeah yeah and it adds up yeah so you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week and that's a lot of money yeah it is it is yeah but you know if they're gonna be in day care then they need to have some activities other than just being there um-hum how do you have two children i have two one is four and a half and the other one's two and a half well they're expensive too uh just the outgrowing of their clothes so i'm sure the budget so yeah yeah that yeah i just came back to find jeans for the little one and it does add up yeah but um yeah and medical bill yeah although the insurance we had was good uh when Thomas was younger a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front and then you were reimbursed so it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the insurance but in the meantime you had to put out the money first yeah yeah well that that's that's hard but i'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can but yeah it is oh i would too i would i would advise anyone that could possibly do it to to for the i know it's not forever and that's what's so sad but well you probably wouldn't wanna do it forever i don't know though when  why don't you go ahead with the fishing part well uh i mostly do i fish for uh bass okay down here and uh i don't get to do as much as i'd like to but uh i i really enjoy i don't like fishing on big lakes but uh um-hum sure on the small ponds where you can pretty much cover the whole pond in an afternoon or something sure for the different areas yeah right yeah and basically big lake small lake it doesn't matter to me um preference wise to fish for the best if you're going to eat what you are going to catch is pan fish um i've caught you know are northern and and pipes and uh northern pipes and other walleyes and things like that and preferably to me the meat isn't that great i'd rather have the blue gills the sunnies the crappies the perch um to me they're better tasting so i always seem to go fishing for the smaller um smaller fish versus the big fish but um when i was growing up my father kind of introduced me to fly fishing and that was kind of a very interesting uh experience that i had and i'm sure that part of me would like to go back and do that it's kind of like for trout fishing um-hum and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time the most if i go fishing it's basically with the worm at the end of the hook and i you know try to catch the small fish it's it's not for the big try to try to get the biggie so yeah yeah i use a fly quite a bit uh when i go bass fishing um-hum when they're hitting on the top of the water i i really like enjoy i i've never sure it's kind of fun i i mean it's a continual movement and versus uh yeah yeah uh when you put that uh worm at the end of the hook you sit there and you wait and you wait and then you may move it a little bit just to say that hey you know there's something there but uh um-hum uh with fly fishing you're constantly uh moving that uh you know your line and you're continually keeping it up and keeping it back down so yeah and there's a skill in getting it to right where you want it exactly exactly so i really enjoy that it takes a lot of patience and a lot of time to learn how to do it so yeah um but uh with my family uh when we do got fishing uh my my daughter's real small and she has not experienced fishing yet so i'd rather um-hum you know get her into fishing with the worm at the end of the hook and hopefully catch some uh fish so uh-huh yeah i had a chance to go to uh Alaska for six weeks last summer and did some salmon fishing up there and that was really uh oh gosh yeah oh what an experience huh yeah yeah that was and and it was now that i wouldn't probably i i'm sure that they probably were very delicious tasty oh yes um we we uh i think the best way i had it prepared was smoked um-hum um-hum and uh it was really good really good yeah yeah but they have and it seems like quite a few different varieties and uh um some are some are better than others sure in the in the salmon yes um-hum yeah well i've also noticed i don't know the best time of the year for fishing uh in this area is right after the winter and the ice is been on and it's real cold water um-hum but it seems like if you go fishing like in the middle of the summer when it's hot and humid uh the fish tastes tastes fishy versus um when the water it's just opened up from the ice and the water temperature is extremely cold um-hum it's almost the better tasting fish are either ice fishing uh when you go ice fishing or when uh you know you go right towards the early spring part uh before summer hits because after summer whether the ponds here aren't that deep or the water just changes and it gets busier and more people are out on the lakes and less maybe water like in the spring we have lots of rain coming in um there's a big difference in you know fishing too um-hum which brings up another point point too as far as ice fishing that's uh way up here in the north here yeah that's uh that's a big thing too and i haven't done that in a long time but that's enjoyable if you have the right setting and you have a little house to sit in there and uh um-hum a little heater then it's then it's it's good but uh if you have to sit out there in the blowing winds it's not so great on a lake yeah i bet but anyway it was really good talking to you and uh have fun fishing yeah i i didn't know uh i didn't know i thought they were only recording male voices they must have changed that you know this is kind of funny um i've had nothing but male callers uh-huh um every time that i've placed a call it's been with a male and i'm not quite sure if they're taking uh um-hum i think what they're trying to do is get a lot of men and some women together i was chosen the first time i went through in um-hum hum  um a lot of companies now are are using uh drug testing uh paraphernalia and drug testing situations to to root out the the either uh yeah elementary or intermediate or advanced uh drug users uh-huh and uh i know that that government is uh you know gives drug tests uh to all new entrants all new applicants applicants coming into government uh-huh and and i quite frankly don't see anything wrong with it i i'm guess i'm not a good civil libertarian and and i i feel as though uh that uh uh you know that if you you are a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background of course we're being involved in my organization uh we we have deep background checks and sure sure and so uh but but you but sometimes you know drug use can can escape that and uh i have absolutely no compunction about uh using any and all means to to uh uh you know work out figure out who has a drug program or has a drug problem hm uh-huh and uh and putting that guy into into therapy to or whatever it is to to you know break this uh uh activity of course if he's fallen in love with drugs and there isn't anything but getting stoned or high is is the only thing in life that seems be meaningful then maybe there is no hope yeah what's your uh feeling um well i guess i i guess i'm probably a little more toward toward the other direction um well i guess mainly because um it's i well like there's two sides to it i guess um one is that um if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug alcohol whatever or you know even if it's smoking inhibits you know your ability to function then i i think that that you know i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual you know on the spot um but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business um and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that uh things like drug laws seem to come and go you know we had prohibition for awhile and then we didn't have prohibition um you know we've had i guess laws against uh you know various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years i guess maybe a little longer um-hum well i think uh the drug the laws on uh uh uh the first morphine laws were were like ninety or nineteen ten or nineteen five something like that yeah well so eighty eighty eighty years or so yeah yeah um so i you know it's it's hard to i guess for me to justify what seems seems like you know basically a breach of the First Amendment you know freedom from uh search and seizure you you know um on something that may or may not stand as a law you know fifty years from now or even twenty or ten who knows well the thing of it is the the that that that that is uh uh in in many respects uh i mean prohibition certainly didn't last uh you know just just a i think an over simplification i i think there there the the there's so much criminal activity well but you got to look at prohibition though you had the same problems there right uh that that people go into to to support drug habit yeah you know they they support drug habits with uh with uh you you know with things like uh you know burglary or or prostitution or stuff like that yeah yeah oh yeah sure well it goes back to the again if you look at prohibition i mean because it's illegal it costs more if it was legal i mean face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what ten or twenty dollars an ounce yeah i i i must admit that and clearly if you're into Coke and all you wanna do is you know snort your brains out all day long if it was legal you could do it real cheap and you know you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it hm yeah but yeah get um yeah i i must must admit that the the production costs of of these drugs are are zippo compared to the street market costs and the oh yeah well that's why there's you know why there's people dealing it because there's money in it you know there's a ridiculous amounts of money in it and the costs to society yeah but i i i i think that that the that you know the being in law enforcement you know is that that i'm i probably have a kind of a draconian Philistine attitude toward it and but but the uh uh i i really feel as though the interdiction effort is is as soon as you you get rid of one goon that's that's that's involved in drugs yeah and then another another one will jump up oh yeah interdiction's hopeless i mean there's no way you're ever gonna win that but we we see the tighter you squeeze the more the price goes up so the more incentive there is i mean that's a losing fight yeah as as as as as soon as we we wind up uh uh you know uh well i think if we could just destroy the market by destroying the demand but but people will wanna get get stoned and i i don't see that yeah yeah well yeah it goes back to you know what right what can society impose on people i mean can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen i don't think you can i mean yeah you know i'm you know was raised with the very strong Bible work ethic so you know i'm one of these you know ten twelve fifteen twenty hour a day type people um-hum so you know yeah i i can really relate to yeah everybody ought to do their own share you know i don't have any you know love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or or that kind of stuff um-hum but you know  okay what do you think about our politicians oh my i i wish there was a way to to pick uh people who weren't um i i think politics you have to be real interested in power yeah i do too uh of course and and power corrupts yeah you're right so i just uh i think all politicians are really a bunch of crooks i shouldn't say that but i bet you that ninety five percent of them are they're all just for themselves mostly well i i do believe there are people that are truly concerned about um society and making a better a better world and go in it um-hum for honest uh reasons and honest maybe wanting to improve improve the community or country or whatever um-hum um-hum but um to get elected you have to um sell your soul it seems like to yeah really and then it seems like they bring out all the dirt that they can bring out about a person you know stuff oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think that's awful uh it it it's absolutely irrelevant uh the only thing people should be talking about are what are your ideas uh for yeah about education about health insurance about foreign affairs or whatever right right and none of this other stuff should and what are and how do you plan to implement uh programs um-hum um-hum um and you don't hear any of that no right all you hear is the bad things about them uh but um it'd be hard uh i don't know what to say really about politicians like i say i just i just can't believe too many of them at all and i read you know about them and everything about different ideas they they all seem to have something wrong with them well i really liked uh the meyer of San Francisco i used to live there and voted for him uh oh the one that just got out of Agnus uh-huh um-hum yes Agnus and for example he had a really good plan for the homeless um-hum which is a huge problem here oh i know it's all over isn't it and it just got some award a national sort of recognition as being uh a program that really looks at the roots of problems um-hum but the problem was that it wasn't quickly implemented uh or that it wasn't the band aid um-hum um-hum so it didn't look good immediately immediately um-hum it really if you go to to uh to solve root problems they take a while um-hum and i think they public wants uh quick fixes um-hum and they don't want thoughtful long-term planning and uh um-hum so we we get disgusted if it's not glitzy yeah yeah he wasn't in office very long was he four years you know oh oh well what did this uh marriage you've got now over there what did he what was he going to do that was different one of his one of his ideas was to ship them all out to another city i mean he's the police chief and was just going to you know round them all up and and and put them out on a farm or something that sounds funny doesn't it tell him to send him down here to Patterson so what do you think about Oakland's mayor oh dear i don't i don't know and i don't know i mean Oakland seems like they have an awful lot of problems there oh God we certainly do you know have you lived there long uh i last three years three and a half years uh-huh um-hum um-hum yeah i know that that should i say have a lot of in fact more mortgage and every thing this year than they they did oh it's terrible uh it's just yeah that's a whole other topic um-hum uh but i think he has been trying to um you know curve some of the you know address some of the problems um-hum um-hum um yeah and uh  uh i don't know my personal perception of government and uh the way things are at this current time is that nobody can really be trusted and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to uh be self-serving to the community i think that they have their own uh wishes to uh be in the limelight and to kind of say hey you know i'm a public official i don't have to do uh certain things and they just stand out more involving themselves more and more with politics but uh it's really after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts uh of checks uh before that it was the wonderful uh escapade that they had with uh the new uh oh God chief of uh well Supreme Court i'm trying to think of his name and uh what they put uh him through in regards to yeah Thomas Thomas uh-huh the sex the sexual harassment that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that i i just think it's very corrupt and whether or not they need to start with people that are extremely poor and send them into government versus people that are rich but it's always the rich person that gets into government that has uh the money to advertise the money to do to do this there's no more Abe Abraham Lincolns out there uh that can get into government even if they were poor so i know that's my personal viewpoint of things doesn't Wisconsin have a uh state uh Medicare program or health program now they just uh they've already put through the health bill yes it just went through and it was passed and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical uh i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people you know what i'm saying it it's right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health uh system and of course they think uh Wisconsin our neighbor or Minnesota our neighbor passed a state law the health bill and it's kind of like we're the first to do it so i don't know if it's done because we're we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for uh you know a real good purpose to help people that can't afford uh health insurance that kind of thing right well i i think the one of the biggest problems that uh we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself uh-huh oh sure and that is uh uh we become so debt ridden and credit oriented oh sure uh instead of uh cash and carry or debt free and therefore uh that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities state and federal governments uh-huh it it sure does and i think it it is reflecting like you said i think society as a whole uh you can't expect uh when we have TVs and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for uh you know immorality and this and this and this that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be clean totally clean and come into government uh right but down the line it does hurt i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something it's uh you know it does hurt the each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or you know the other things that have occurred so uh well what is see the thing is is when a lot of things become acceptable practice uh it's hard to discern the border what has become muddy as to what is ethical and what is not ethical and then someone blows the whistle and says uh-huh exactly oh this is not ethical and yes i did it too yeah well that's exactly what happens in government all the time hey blow the whistle on each other oh i hear that you're doing this i've done it but oh boy and it's not going to get out exactly yeah exactly exactly it's uh yeah we just had a there's no secrets in the government uh i don't think anymore uh right the mayor of Dallas is uh Bartlett Steve Bartlett he also uh was a congressman uh-huh uh-huh uh to the uh to Congress and he had been in that position for years uh-huh sure and uh he was elected mayor of Dallas overwhelmingly uh-huh uh-huh however if the vote was taken today the whole thing might change because he was part of that uh check kiting scam oh sure i think i i don't think uh  up here in Rochester uh we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution i think Grand Rapids was number one uh we really don't have too much of a problem as far as uh industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here but we do have the same problem a lot of are other areas up here in the northeast have and that is the effects of acid rain right coming coming basically from coal plants in Ohio and Illinois and Indiana well that's that's that's true actually down here we don't have a big problem with uh with air pollution mainly because we don't have anybody to the either side of us uh which helps out a lot as far as that goes i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in Boston and up in uh you know debates would come up up there in Massachusetts and you know in that area over uh air pollution and their attitude's basically well prevailing ins winds are to the east so why should we have to worry yeah i've i've uh was in Los Angeles once and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes i mean you couldn't really see that much every once in a while we have these air inversions the weather oh yes nothing inversions and then it gets hazy around here but they're really we don't have a big problem with it i think that uh what most of the people here in New York state are going after right now is it's it's the uh ongoing acid rain problem especially out in the uh uh Adirondack areas where you know the lakes are becoming uh changing the acidity of the lakes and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants uh or alkaline liking plants are just not lasting anymore because the soil levels the p H is changing right as this acid rain continues to fall and i know that there's been battles over the states up here uh you know Governor Mario going after you know governors of Ohio and and Indiana to fix what's going on down there i remember when i was in Florida the only problem was that it seemed like it may it wasn't really pollution just the steamy weather oh absolutely yeah just muggy so yes i think you're yeah i think you're right our most pollute substance down here is just water but uh yeah it hey i i i think you know the biggest causes though even then a lot of times are uh uh like when i was up in Boston just all the cars you know all over the place you just got a lot of you know a a lot of pollution from those and uh you know if you don't have a wind it sticks around oh yeah i you know i was in Boston once and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour even with the tee um just this it looked like billions of cars massing absolutely and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go i mean yeah that's what's in you know Los Angeles is i think that's biggest problem because when i was in Los Angeles for a time it's all you know from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city right and there's really there's nowhere for this to be absorbed really um tree planting sometimes can handle you know stopping some of the air pollution and that and help but if you have nowhere to do anything that's that's very true uh you know of course then when when you're not recycling you've got these incendiary plants and stuff that can be some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere but i you know you've you've got you've got the industry you've got that and you got the cars and i think the cars are where where it's at right now as far as pollution goes air air pollution i mean yeah i you know Florida doesn't seem to be at least maybe Miami but i i uh you know Fort Lauderdale i i don't know what the big industries are down there uh but you know up here we have Kodak and that's the worst polluter they put uh right uh you can smell ether in the air sometimes keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess i i guess so uh cause they clean the uh the lenses for cameras and they they make film here and they're the worst offender but you know sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them but that's really getting under control now right i you know i i don't know in the air down here what they do uh i i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i i i've really seen a lot of you know upsettedness about uh i i i know i've seen like uh my grandparents live in Corpus Christi Texas and i know they've there's a lot of refineries down there and and that's that's some pretty potent stuff they can put up in the air yeah i but i don't know how uh yeah there's a difference in what you can smell and what you uh you know what's bad be interesting to see when as Mexico develops industrially whether you know without  been on the line for awhile i almost forgot what the topic was okay um based uh but i know what it is uh let me see i i i i i'm kind of i don't know you know i'm i'm kind of in the middle i i think it's a great idea oh okay good uh-huh but when it comes to me it's like almost an insult you know so it's i i've come from the teaching field right so do i so so it's just like i don't know i i guess i guess i'd have to go with uh i i i'd be for it uh-huh you know but uh you know i i i don't know it's just kind of a kind of a delicate subject i guess but i i i would i would probably go for for going ahead and doing it you know if it's got to be done for everyone right i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company it should be random testing it should be for everybody right you know when they answer the company i think it'll make it a lot easier and they'd run into less problems right yeah because uh i don't know i come from the teaching field too and it sort of uh it's a pro and a con type i don't know where to stand on it yeah i'm more or less if they told me i had to well then fine but if you know if they made me then i'd probably if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no you know just this yeah yeah you kind of goes into your privacy and right you know but i guess if they you know you know there's uh i i guess there's some companies that aren't that are doing it and it it seems to be working out so uh-huh yeah i think it's it's what they're basically trying to do i don't know up here in Massachusetts anyhow what they're basically trying to do is uh oh gosh uh any people who had drug tested positively getting them into a drug program or rehab program yeah right and uh anybody who uh gee is you know did doesn't accept the rehab program then they're more or less getting laid off see that's hard i i think that's really hard to because you know you never know i don't know it's it that's a it's really weird issue i'm sort of on the fence about it yeah yeah but i you know that that's what's they're coming across as is some of the companies anyhow oh we can get you into a drug program but then you wear that stigma you know yeah yeah where uh like a lot of people are saying well i only smoked a joint last night i don't have any problems you know or something like that yeah yeah and then i kind of hear it goes into like uh this is just something i've heard that it kind of goes into like uh just your off the counter medication that you could be taking for a cold that it kind of affects that too right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test oh i didn't know that um i know i'm an epileptic so i'd probably test positive and yeah see things like that so and then i'd have a heck of a time explaining what drug is in my system you know yeah and a lot of times those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you you know it's very personal right right uh-huh i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because then i'd always wonder if they fired me you know why did you fire me see that's yeah that's where i kind of get into cause it's just kind of gets into your personal life you know and uh-huh it's like what's what's kind of next yeah it it hits me as the Orwell thing Big brother is watching the what Orwell huh and you know his book Big brother is watching oh you know you're being controlled that type of deal and i shy i don't really you know i don't know yeah seems awful strange i'd hate to have to if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't i'd probably take the company who didn't right yeah because i feel there'd be more trust in the employees right but i can understand why they need it with all the you know train accidents and everything else so do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually i kind of think they will uh i think they will too because uh you know it's just going to follow yeah i don't know i we haven't had any of it in our school system so uh you know hopefully we won't yeah we haven't either oh yeah but i i i just kind of think it's heading that way though you know it's just because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff and i just right i just kind of think it's going to eventually head that way well and eventually it's going to be not only the teachers you know the kids are going to be under scrutiny it's going to be the teachers yeah right and if they can test the teachers that gives them the full right to test the kids right and then they've you know caught everybody more yeah  yeah i guess uh uh it's an easy one for me i think that's uh there's something seriously wrong yeah what is it that you are you know particularly upset about uh i guess uh i think they've lost their compass and uh i'm not sure they know exactly what uh uh public education supposed to be for anymore but uh i voted with my feet and uh my kids go to parochial school uh-huh so um what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in uh the public school system well one hundred percent of the uh customers care that's one thing everybody cares about the education the kids are getting and um they uh take an active relatively active part which uh i mean if you're uh sending two thousand dollars that way every year you uh watch what goes on and you um um pay attention and participate and and you can influence the way things are so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocket book for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of uh real estate or other taxes and and consequently they're not so motivated to get involved to make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen yeah the immediacy just isn't there and um uh i also think that one one of the problems and actually i don't think this i think this is a cultural problem um-hum the uh problem with public education is really uh really a problem with the culture and i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like California for example where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school and you can't get a tax levy passed um people are um reluctant to pass uh school tax levies even uh when the money is needed or would be well spent because it's uh they don't have kids in the schools right i think that's a a loss of civic virtue and a loss of um uh the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids i think that's uh that's the principal problem is that uh people no longer see it as uh as their problem and as an immediate problem right it troubles me too that that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good and by definition for some of us at least the public good includes having an educated populace i mean the idea uh that uh you can make a sound judgment with respect to small votes in in the at the local level or bigger votes at the national level uh right yeah uh it means that you've got to be informed and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading and the critical thinking involved to come up with a decision yeah you know i i believe that the original idea of public education in the United States which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution um you know it barely made it i think it was added afterwards i think the real the principal reason was uh education for civic participation the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they'd be a better voter right and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes right it has taken on a more more more profound and you'd think we'd notice it economic uh thrust yeah well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i i think that one is well i'm glad that you added that one yeah i think that one's significant that that's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor and then i quit and got disabused of that notion but um the um uh now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is um an economic enterprise to um train people for jobs and um i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is and i'm really sad to say this i never thought i would have but i really think that uh the educational establishment has become part of the problem and uh that's why i guess i'm sort of reluctantly uh in favor of these uh choice programs right well i i agree agree with everything that you've said so far and the only thing i'd wanna add is that i'm a little more in contact i think with public school teachers than perhaps you are uh except as a parent of your child and the sense sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing and they are the three things that you mentioned but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related like consumer education right that's what  kids too yeah the hat oh you laugh how many what ages well uh twenty seven up ah and we had five you've been through the fun part oh yeah and how about yourself i have a four and a half and a three oh well so it's i i'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way in the way it's done now and then yeah well when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively but i always uh just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them yeah so it was an hour you know yeah but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them but what was the age difference between the oldest and youngest six years so they were all real close that's tough that's a lot of time yeah oh yeah we look back and wonder how we did it did you both work your wife too or no she never did uh well qualify that she worked at home i'm sure and well yeah yeah but that's uh well both my husband and i work and sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening maybe thirty minutes max yeah well that's plenty though And well he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking and then i spend time with them while you know he's doing other stuff and and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend you know there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it but it's neat it's straight and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know right right well you you know with kids you're not going to have a neat house well i've accepted that too that's true and you know it it's tough to find time especially especially especially with both of them working it is yeah that's true and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it well that's true and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know we try to spend Saturdays together if my husband golfs you know he'll do it during nap times things like that where they're not really missing the presence you know right right and we do a lot of family things together we're we're kind of going the other direction this weekend we're planning a trip just he and i this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago so well that's good too yeah that's good that way too well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twenty four hours a day yeah well that's what they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day but yeah and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too sure sure or whatever and and they think that's a family activity you know yeah that's great fun oh yeah and uh well yeah if you my daughter's like mommy can i help you with the laundry of course you can absolutely yeah yeah just keep them talking that way but uh another thing we used to do is have family councils uh-huh every Sunday night and what would you do what discuss everything that didn't agree with them and we'd take turns being president oh and everyone would get one's vote and i always thought we'd get outvoted five to two yeah but it never worked that way so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week and then yeah well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too oh and that was always good time boy we really got to know the kids well hum i imagine and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them and oh yeah in fact they were all in uh over the weekend for Easter i oh that's wonderful see i was raised in that type of family where you know you don't disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it yeah well we did too and and i remember the one daughter saying we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree uh-huh and she said hey i don't make fun fun of your friends so why make fun of mine well kind of run kind of hit us between the eyes yeah yeah you don't think of it that way do you no but that that was always good quality time for us now that's good i like that idea and they never had to attend but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules whatever was voted on huh yeah and boy they'd they'd show up well i think that's great and we'd usually take notes and you know the younger kids uh yeah or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another yeah and uh but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us and they loved it i i think that's true i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment yeah and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know so i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves you know yeah yeah but uh boy i i feel for you and your husband well yeah my my uh oh why is that two of my uh  have you ever done this yes i have what did you do unfortunately unfortunately uh oh this will be interesting it yeah it it's it's really hard to please everybody and it it takes a lot of planning a lot more a lot more effort you know you have to decided what you're going to do have you ever done one well actually i'd i sort of do this uh anytime my family comes to town uh-huh i mean we have a very immediate family it's not really extended um-hum uh i was an only child my mother is an only child so we don't have like tons and tons of relatives so it's really my parents and i have five children three are married and they have little kids um-hum and so you know it's basically us and so when every body comes it is very hectic and i guess that's as close to what we have as a reunion and we do this at Christmas and we just did this last week and so um it's hard to get everyone to be able to come at the same time um-hum that's the hard part is was my son was missing last week because he's a teacher and he had things he had to do and he couldn't just leave but uh it's really hard to get everyone together but we don't have lots of aunts and uncles and things like that to consider yeah our um uh the ones i was involved in was with my wife's family and it's very extended there are aunts and great-aunts and cousins and cousin's children yeah that would be so much harder and there's oh over the last fourteen years depending on where we went and what we did there's anywhere from and thirty or forty to fifty sixty and sometimes more than that you know during different phases of what we're trying to do uh so how often do you try to all get together um they try every year oh no are you all from the same place pretty much or we're kind of in the same area most everybody is from uh Idaho and Utah uh-huh and there are some from there well there's a couple back east and they travel they've come a few times there's some from California uh-huh and i think there's some from Washington where do you have these things i mean how long do they usually we've been having them in Idaho that's where it's at someone's house or i mean um no we've had them out in uh kind of wilderness uh areas before we go camping so you go camping do you i see well that's kind of good and we've had them at resorts uh you know smaller resort places uh uh-huh you know kind of like camp ground things but that way no one has all the work i mean once it's planned nobody has to worry about fixing food for everybody and that kind of thing right well we we do uh we we have some traditional things and the first night's usually like a potluck everybody just brings whatever they want and uh-huh and we have those kind of foods and and then usually the first morning breakfast is just that each body does their own and then have games all day so there is a lot of planning though for things like that i guess anyway huh um-hum yeah there there is we we do uh uh you know we have we have quite a few we have a sing along one of the uncles plays the guitar and sings and then everybody puts on a talent show each family's supposed to that's so neat though that's great do talent show things and we have an an auction everybody brings in made goods or things that they do and we have an auction and then that goes into the family fund oh and who has the family fund and well they elect officers every year you're kidding i have never heard of this uh they have uh yeah they have a they have a a president usually they try to elect the family and inside that family there'll be the president and or the chairman or whatever and then each person has an assignment to to you know carry out one part of the thing like one one one person will have um the games and one will have the food and one will have the auction and one'll have the program oh boy that's a big job for one family whatever it is so it well well when i'm talking family it's it's like my mother-in-law my mother-in-law's children so that'd my wife and her her sisters and brothers uh-huh i see so it's separated really yeah right so it's um it uh you know it's extended it's extended family what it is is my mother my mother-in-law and her sisters and brothers right and their oh i don't know there's twelve of them or fourteen of them or something like that not all of them are living still but there's probably eight or nine that still are hum and then all of their kids and their kid's kids and yeah i see so it's  i'm Nevin from Sunnyvale California hi this is Jim Bliss from Minneapolis Minnesota how you doing pretty good good um i guess the topic is trial by jury and how we should change that or how how we would change it um i'm ready whenever you are yep hum okay so uh what are your what are your thoughts on the subject there well i definitely think like decisions have to be unanimous yeah yeah i think that's probably a a good thing it's probably the safest thing yeah i mean it's to to easy to get a quorum and simple majority won't do yep i no and even even like you know two thirds majority i mean yeah that's yeah quorums are to easy to get and there's always that that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason you know so it's it's yeah definitely yep yeah but um i don't know it i could i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing yeah like gives gives them a little too much power yeah that i i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that or arguing against that pretty vehemently but um plus you know you may be you know doing a you know a a guilty verdict but it may not be you know may be for technical reasons yeah about the only good thing i would see about that is that would it that it would um hurry the process up a bit yeah but i mean even now we've got i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that i know what i and that's what the trial by jury i mean jeez if it if the judge was doing it himself without any checks and balances yeah it to be there'd be much more of that whose to say yeah no doubt are you involved in the legal system at all no but i tend i tend to follow it just to okay just to know what's going on yeah yeah i've got some friends that are lawyers so yeah i do too so one of them just got his law degree but um to tell you the truth i'm not real familiar with um the system of jurisprudence jurisprudence the way it is right now i really haven't studied it in depth no yeah i know a little more about civil cases when than criminal cases which is it's more in how you present it versus you know who's right yeah i'm sure of it because a lot of those things it's all it's in it's largely a matter of viewpoint and who can argue their case better yep um it's kind of weird i don't know yeah i always think about watching the People's Court or something and how weird those cases get i know it's just when i was uh couple of years ago involved in some pretrial stuff and like you know you go say okay we can't bring up this point because then they're gonna you know the opposition will say this this and this and yeah um-hum and it's like boy the stuff that they can twist around is it's pretty amazing yep and it's like the the truth really isn't important anymore it's yeah it's not and then you get people who who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because like this this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious and he really gets into suing people yep and so he'll he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court and argue his case you know it's like that sounds like a little abuse of our system but it is it's it's wasting people's time and the taxpayers' money and everything else but uh yeah but it's for the more general people don't want to take responsibility yeah you know that's a and uh and and most of the time they're looking to place blame um yep and stuff see you're from California is that right uh yeah well originally Chicago but hum oh okay i was just thinking i wonder i wonder how how the civil system or the the court systems differ between there and say where i am in Minneapolis i mean from what i understand it's all pretty much the same except when you get to Louisiana i i really and Louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the what is it it's based on common law and the rest of the country is not or something like that it's pretty strange oh yeah but uh fortunately i never have had to go in even even for jury duty yeah i haven't either other than but um that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in for uh as a witness he may subpoena me so we'll see what happens but uh yeah i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better i yeah it's there are too many big problems you know there's there's such a backlog of court cases right now i know you know to try to get them all in in a good time and we already have too many lawyers as it is yeah and if it's criminal cases we you can't put them in jail because there's no room left yeah yeah that's true and in fact they're even letting some go i'm i'm originally i'm originally from Florida and it's like it seems like every year they let out more and more just because they don't have room for them yeah um you know that's not a that's not a good solution either not at all so i'm not real sure what to  okay Randall uh uh do you have any special interest in uh space flight oh yeah ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom TVs uh-huh uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting um-hum yeah the uh uh i've always i've always uh wanted wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that um-hum and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen of course i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday um-hum but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately what do you do now uh computer programmer oh unfortunately that can be done from the ground yeah to bad uh yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space the uh uh i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time we'd have lots more in stuff in space than we do now um-hum um-hum uh frustrating at times um-hum i don't know what you think about all that well uh yeah i uh i'm kind of young i'm only twenty two and so uh uh i'm not you know there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties uh-huh um although i have a i i kind of wonder uh if some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the uh respect that you know there's endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy yeah well yeah well the uh uh i've always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up um-hum uh because that's a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesn't do it that doesn't require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact exactly and you can just get as much power as you need up there it's a matter of how big you build it um-hum um-hum uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no things that i think we should be doing so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good you know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also right yeah it seems like uh there's uh so you're talking about positive side effects then okay i understand so i'm yeah right right um sure that that makes a lot of sense right the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there um-hum yeah and they want to do the research and uh they're all yeah you know no no one the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars right exactly which is would would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and and uh and uh so forth um-hum it it would be done it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor um-hum to get politician's votes instead of instead of for for you know we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so right we should do it because for the for the return we get for it and uh um-hum uh unfortunately that's not why things happen exactly i i would settle for the glitz for the glitz if the side effects were useful if they oh but uh least nothing yeah the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it right now we're done now let's now we're done no need to use this anymore to play around with this space stuff anymore that's what happened with Apollo yeah i think you're right uh but uh i'd give almost anything to get into space i would too i'd i'd uh it was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle  anyway i guess there was just somebody recently down there wasn't today in Texas was it or there was uh i'm not put to death uh i'm not sure there was the big one uh earlier in the week in uh California that on on and off and on and off um um in California yeah yeah so how do you feel about it about capital punishment i i don't know i'm i'm uh mixed views on it i don't i don't think that it really does much good as it as a deterrent uh the old thing in in terms of uh the the the uh biggest day for pickpockets was at the when they were hanging pickpockets but in public but uh um-hum uh on the other hand it it the it seems like that there just aren't are uh some crimes and and some lives that that that there's no other at least emotional reaction to it what about you yeah well i've you know i i kind of like you there's certain certain crimes that i think it fits i'm for it generally speaking i think the thing that bugs me the most about it is that the process itself gets so drug out and so you know i understand you need to prove without a shadow of a doubt that the guilt and whatnot but the appeal process of it i think is what really bugs me if you're gonna make it go so long you know what's the use of it yeah it almost becomes more more cost you know to much cost and more trouble than it's worth you know to to put somebody like that to death or something that you know yeah rather than just sentence him to life and forget all the hassle you don't have to pay the attorneys all those fees they get and whatnot because i feel like you know sometimes it gets too drug out but yeah yeah yeah i think i am i am basically for it with if you know if the crime of course fits it because some of those people this you got to wonder will they ever do anything i mean yeah right right that that there's just uh the time just comes that pure and simple you know you got to wonder if they're just a plain and simple menace to society or they gonna right right ever reform but right well now does does uh uh Utah have capital punishment yes we do uh-huh and i and it's been a couple there was a oh it's been about fourteen years now there was a pretty hideous murder in a hi-fi shop where they murdered one person and they they the two people that did it they poured Drano down one guy's throat and they kicked a pen through another guy's ear and and all kinds of things like that and and of course a couple of them ended up dying and a couple didn't but um ah one of the kid one of the two men involved was uh was was uh put to death oh about two years ago and and like i said if it took about thirteen years for it to happen and the other guy is still sitting on death row you know fourteen fifteen years later um yeah and that's why you know like i say a part of my thing with the whole appeal process kind of bugs me because here they have sat for you know fifteen years and i i wonder about the families of the people who are the victims you know and they've got to be a little bit upset themselves and yeah that that that's it and uh that that it if it's gonna happen it seems like there there there's some sort of closure when it when it's over and done with i know that was one of that um-hum aspects that covered the sequel to the case in California was was both it this is the first one in twenty five years and they've got something like over three hundred on uh-huh death row but the other thing was whether you know the family of the victims uh one of the fathers of the boys i think in California but you know wanted to be there to to witness it and it didn't feel like the whole thing was over and that's been fourteen years too i think and uh uh-huh yeah that's true yeah they uh uh oh i forgot i lost my point but yeah that's like i say i think the the victims and just if that's gonna happen they they just wanna have it done and over with but you know i agree there's got to be some appeal process because it's almost you you wanna make sure in that situation that the person really did commit the crime uh you wanna give him every opportunity you possible can but uh yeah well that's the that's the thing here in here in here in Texas we've had a couple of cases in the last one one was a was a murder case where it was um-hum at this point it's fairly obvious that it was a that a a girl was killed at a high school and it was pretty obvious that the police just picked out the black janitor and and uh set him up for it and uh he really didn't have anything to do with it and they that certainly makes you think again again and yeah yeah and uh um-hum um-hum yeah that's that's the scary part especially something like this i know in uh you know this California case the uh the Civil Liberty or ACLU i guess the American Civil Liberty you know they were doing anything they could to prevent it even to going as far as uh yeah you know stating the gas chamber is not uh as cruel or is cruel and unusual punishment and in such that they just drag up any little thing they possible can to drag it out or or whatnot you know i mean yeah well now in uh in Utah what's the method it is it firing squad or what huh they use firing squad is is what's used a firing squad yeah yeah that's what i was thinking wasn't there a a big case  okay um i haven't been in this situation yet you know my my parents are not quite at that age yet so i haven't that's not quite elderly huh no so i haven't uh really been in that situation although they are thinking about my grandmother but um uh-huh that's really about it how about you have you been in that situation where you've had to um not for my parents but i i was around uh two sets of grandparents um quite a bit we we put one i put one grandfather in a rest home uh-huh and that killed him well yeah kind of well there was some other things involved but it before he was really active and did it really the there was some you know he lost lost his drivers license and uh couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home yeah and he just kind of became a vegetable and died oh no that's sad so but that was a long time ago that was uh back in like seventy three yeah oh okay so um i think the way they did things were a lot different back then are sure they were and uh my grandmother his his wife uh we also put her in a rest home she was in a rest home and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there yeah uh-huh and uh had a physical had a good physical therapist at that place oh and they worked with her and got her walking and got her taking kind of taking care of herself and so she was able to come back home yeah oh and then she had to go back in a couple of times but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up huh and they got her going again yeah so i guess as far as looking and i said the as what you're looking for i think you need to look for an active uh interactive staff uh-huh somebody who's willing to work with uh you know work with a patients and do do things with them and treat them treat them like that yeah and i'm sure it's it's expensive it it is yeah yeah it is expensive yeah my my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a oh they're like um they're apartments for senior citizens what uh-huh oh uh-huh and she loves that because it it they arrange activities for them all day long and then they have um where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go um-hum and she she she really does love that but she's just concerned about in in the future you know she she knows it's not gonna be like that all the time and she's just wondering well what's gonna happen to me and and i you know it's i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that but uh-huh when she can't take care of herself um-hum now that you know she's kind of asking questions about what well what's gonna happen you know this can't last forever and uh-huh so does she have a is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to or she can go down to the cafeteria yeah it yeah she can but i i think it is also cafeteria style because i i really i i i doubt if she rarely cooks for herself uh-huh so uh fact i because i i remember her in her letters telling me she she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat so i'm assuming it's something like that too so uh-huh so yeah i i really like that concept they've they have a few of those well quite a few of those places like that here in Utah and uh you know i um-hum couples can you know husband and wife can can live there too or or whatever i and and and then and yet they have their their friendships and relationships the you know of getting together and eating together and all of that yeah yeah i i think it really takes um you you know looking more at the people than even really the facilities um-hum and she lives by herself too she seems to like it and um my husband's grandmother is uh-huh well she lives she lives in a house on her own and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that but she has her own home and she and she's doing really well i'm really proud of her she's doing really well um-hum so we haven't had to do anything but then again she has a lot of support so i mean she's got her mother in town too and things like that so hopefully we won't need to go that route yeah yeah well i i think that that's the thing that's a little bit scary you know a little bit tough about putting them in a rest home is it's it's almost like that you know they say putting them out to pasture and some some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active they they wanted to do things they didn't you know they didn't wanna go down and play bingo or um yeah you know play with the yarn
