 in in light the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem do you why why well if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of Texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to so they could become doctors the problem would go away you think the problem is not enough doctors i think the problem is that the doctor doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor you are going to pay high premiums on your health uh unemployment i mean on your liability gosh i really have a different point of view on this well because i'm a nurse for one thing oh uh-huh and you think there are plenty of doctors oh yeah i don't think there is a shortage of doctors and i do know that OB which is my field the doctors' health insurance the doctors' malpractice insurance is over two hundred thousand dollars a year uh-huh it's astronomical that deliver babies now they can't doing anything about that i don't think they're in a conspiracy i think it's our fault because we as people just sue them no people don't sue people are very sue sue conscious lawyers sue if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor yeah they wouldn't sue a one of them well that's probably true too you know but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days well sure but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the the tort theory you know what tort theory is and so no well a tort is when you do something wrong right well it uh an OBGYN doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent that's right if the baby is born dead well that happens if if they have complications and well it depends well i know i mean there are guys that are real slobs but you know there are also people out there that are really doing their job and the people that are really doing their job are paying for everybody else well that's true they are because doctors are performing many more tests many of them are unnecessary they are doing so many C sections you know just to prevent a a law suit just to prevent because they have all these monitors now and if anything looks even a little bit funny yeah their only safety precaution is to go in and get that baby and so it's costing more all around in health insurance for tests for surgery for longer hospital stay so it's terrible yeah uh-huh see i believe that there there is a system already in place for health care uh-huh you know they have indigent health care you show up at Parkland bleeding and they'll fix you you'll get it that's true you know in fact you'll get it at Presbyterian if you show up there too and we have that happen we have patients that go through Parkland through the clinic and at the last minute they come to us well yeah uh-huh uh-huh uh we can't turn them away so yeah i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation the problem would pretty much evaporate yeah i'm for that i've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer so i'd like to wipe them all out yeah well i i happen to know a few and i even claim one as a friend he's a divorce attorney he better not be mine but i think he'll go nameless for the for the purposes of this conversation but i also know an uh OBGYN who has stopped practicing yeah some they do uh he just said they stop their OB at least yeah i mean he's not going to deliver any more babies ever his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year right right that's incredible and you know he said i had to he had to earn gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice yeah and most of them are very sincere most of them do the best they can they are human occasionally uh yeah this this guy is Catholic something will go wrong yeah i mean you know well you can be human and Catholic yeah i know you can be human and Catholic but you're not likely to find somebody who is going to you know have a less conscientious effort i mean yeah no most of them do i really believe that from dealing with doctors dealing with lawyers there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious but well you know who is getting rich insurance companies yeah they are you know if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance say say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed or  um we have two pets at the moment we have a cat and we also have a bird that's a strange combination i visit the cat is an an outdoor cat and oh um we've had him for four years it's really a good cat when we first talked about getting one my husband isn't really fond of cats and um-hum and we went ahead and got this one for my little girl from her great-grandma and it's turned out to be a very good pet she or he is oh um you know he stays outside he doesn't try and come in the house and trip you up and he just he's almost like a dog our cars will come down the road and and the cat will come running out from oh the fields we live in quite a rural little community and and he comes running he can hear our car so he is more more you know like a dog it's really a good animal oh does your cat try to run away at all no we haven't had a bit of problem with that the only um incident we had about like that was when he was just a kitten um on Halloween we lost track of him and i don't know whether he followed some trick-or-treaters or you know they scared him or what but um-hum oh he uh was gone and we thought for sure he was gone and he was gone three weeks and then he yes and then he came back and he had a crooked paw so apparently he had three weeks oh yeah apparently he had broken his foot somehow but he did come back so well that's great yes yes and how about you we have a dog oh we have a three year old dog it's about medium size and she's uh an indoor dog oh uh-huh oh fun and she is yeah she's like our baby oh now is it is that's that's not still considered a puppy not technically we consider her a puppy i she still acts like a puppy but do you oh real active and yeah oh very oh what's oh what's her name too active Sam Samantha oh oh that's that's a nice name we um our cat is named we named it Duchess and then we found out it was a boy but it was too late to change so and now is is that the only pet you have oh oh that's neat yes oh the what kind of a dog is it she's a mix between a German Shepherd and a Husky oh pretty yeah she is really pretty and she's a good watchdog we live in a one bedroom apartment and she will growl and bark at strangers walking by or she hears any footsteps ah uh-huh oh oh that's good yes it is good it's nice to have boy and your apartment apparently allow they allow pets yes we it was hard to find um apartments out here we live in uh Penn State University and it's hard to find apartments that take pets so we're way on the outskirts of town um-hum oh oh because and we have a ground floor apartment with like a private yard that we can just open up the door and we play Frisbee and ball and uh-huh how nice so that she gets some exercise we go for walks oh boy that sounds ideal because yeah they do need especially dogs they need to run and jump and oh well that's great i um-hum that's true we had a um our little bird we've only had it for about six months and we got that for my son for his birthday and it's named Buttercup a little yellow yellow parakeet yeah they chose that and i one other pet we had had an experience with over the summer it's a kind of a funny thing we oh that's a good bird name my neighbor had given her children each a a a a bunny rabbit for Easter oh wow yes and and then her kids had them for a couple of months and they you know kind of tired of them like kids do and and she said do you want these and so we said yes we'll take them and and take care of them for a while and she said now you know when you don't want them i know a man that just loves them and he'll take them anytime you want and oh we were a little bit reluctant with the cat and the bird already to take on some more but so we took these three rabbits from them hm and about two weeks later um my son went out to feed them and and he said mom i i think the white bunny's sick oh no and so yeah we went out immediately and lifted up the hutch lid and that mama rabbit the white one had had eleven babies uh yeah eleven oh so that was quite a surprise and how many oh my goodness so we went from three bunnies to fifteen in a matter of two weeks but that i guess that was her first time being a mother and i i'm not real oh my gosh knowledgeable about bunnies but they all died and i they all did and she well she didn't take care of them and i've heard sometimes that with their first their first oh they all did you know litter that they do that but yeah it was it was really a really hard experience oh that's sad  okay go ahead and uh tell me what you're looking for in a job now oh one thing that i look for is um well maybe not the most most important thing but benefits like um health insurance for my family okay and another thing would be um reasonable reasonable work hours uh good working environment um right now i think it's we're supposed to talk about uh our current situation i'm a post doctoral fellow and a a what a post doctoral fellow um i okay i'm it's for the training beyond your doctorate degree okay and i get the same benefits as the staff at the university i work at the University of Iowa and i i like i like working at the University one of the benefits there is you get a lot of flexibility in when you work and when you wanna take time off for example this Christmas i have about three weeks that i get to go out west to visit my family and so that's pretty good you it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job so you like having having the flexibility to be able to take off time when you want to that's important to you oh yeah besides just some besides some semester breaks the there is also other um other times too um like during the summer and things like that does uh recognition from others and a sense of contributing to the organization's success does that rank pretty high for you oh yes and that's one of the reasons i like the University too because you do get credit for your own work um my advisor my mentor here especially especially he used to work in industry but he couldn't stand it because um he felt like that his boss at uh at this aerospace place space company where he worked uh his supervisor got credit for all the um achievements that he made so that's why he came back to the University yeah that's that's kind of a rip when you feel that way and so i think at the University you get often get credit for more you know your name gets on what you do like when you publish articles and things like that hey David what's your doctorate in um it's in physics however um you know there is several several branches within physics i i studied sound acoustics and the subject for that is called acoustics sure and i'm specifically interested in the acoustics of speech i'm working now at the National National Center for Voice and Speech that's located here at the University of Iowa so you're kind of interested in this thing that we're participating in then oh i found out about it because i attended um a conference for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and uh the chairman of the session where i presented a paper um um was it Mister Godfrey he um was uh he he he gave me a a thing and said to try and find others to help join for this project hm and so you're enjoying all the benefits that a professor would at the moment is there oh i couldn't say that well i meant as health and uh um i i don't get a the salary for one thing oh yeah nor the job stability post a post post doctoral fellow is only for two years but the ultimate goal usually of a post doctoral fellowship is probably to go on and accept a position at a University so this is um you know the economy with the Gulf War and everything um last year around the time i was graduating um there was just were not very many opportunities available so this was the best thing because um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that okay uh David is one of the things that i i suppose so you don't want to be out in the weather and uh the environment like construction workers for you it's better to be inside air-conditioned warm warm uh yeah especially uh with the humidity here in Iowa yes i i i would uh definitely want a indoors job um do you have a um i work as a EDP auditor yeah yeah and i've got a degree and a bunch of different certifications that go along with  uh so my favorite team is about the Rangers is it i'd have to agree with that they're my favorite team too been a little disappointing the last few years yeah i'm telling you you think they'll sign Ruben you know no i really don't i just don't think you know with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money twenty seven or twenty nine million or whatever it was i just don't think that they're gonna be able to sign Ruben Sierra and it's just gonna be a shame for you know our area right yeah i think it's gonna have a big effect if they don't on the other uh Hispanic players oh i do too i just the main thing is that i think that's gonna be the big problem it's just gonna have an effect on the the team you know right we just can't seem to you know i think we've been in this spot i think we finished second once or maybe even twice i don't know i yeah i haven't been to a baseball game in a couple of years just it's just too disappointing i just watch them fall every year right i was a Pete Incaviglia fan and uh oh i liked him but of course i understand baseball decisions are all just decisions like that have to be made by someone glad it's not me making them right i think they're just want a stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here well they say as long as they draw up two million fans that Greave and Valentine'll be there but right right yeah so and that's the name of the game too you got to make money you know they pay these players so much money now it's just right right it's frightening you and i should be so lucky to you know to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that that's true but uh they're talking about trading him if they're not able to sign him and uh use the money that it would take to sign the guy you know to pay for pitchers or you know what it what it what they what else they need because they've got the hitting but they need the pitching yeah they really do um i think they uh i think they need them all i just don't understand i understand the big cities like in New York or LA or somewhere because big cities and you know a guy a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a oh i know at a at a men's clothing store or something or sporting goods store but i realize the difference but i just don't understand yeah it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working you know your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game oh i know i tell you that's real aggravating but but i one thing i don't understand is why a group you know headed up by George Bush would buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them because i tell you we need a winner in this town looks like our Cowboys are coming back but that's right so that's that's going to be a big help to Dallas but you know in the past half a dozen years all we've had is the uh it's always got yeah it's always yeah the soccer team it's always wondered me why i mean they act as though this area is not you know a big metropolitan area but you think we'd someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the the the players we need oh i know that's a just real aggravating to because i've lived here you know since well i was born and raised here so i've been a Ranger fan since about seventy seven so it's a lot of losers it's about to get you know as bad as the Cubs or whoever you know oh i know i've been one yeah i've been i've lived here since seventy four and i've really been a Ranger fan for the longest time and excuse me i don't miss a time picking up the morning paper and checking the box scores i mean i follow them and i follow them like i follow the Mavericks and like i follow the Cowboys but and i want to see them win because right you know damn it they the fans deserve it i mean it you know we have pretty uh great fans to put two million people in that stadium right i'm telling you i love Nolan Ryan i guess you probably love him too right i think this town'd go crazy if they ever got a even a play-off team time i mean it would be packed and they got that new stadium they're building so at least at least that'll be exciting when we get that but oh i do too it will well where do you think they're heading this year uh it's hard to say it's gonna be depending on where the what they do with Ruben Sierra and uh i mean i'm getting tired of them going into each year saying you know Bobby Witt's the answer and Kevin Brown's the answer and man that's getting old you know these guys have been pampered i mean right it's time to to either you know put out or shut up yeah Bobby Witt gets forced into wins like seventeen games or whatever and they have the later ten game winning streak and they give him all kinds of money and then he just goes right down the tube and right and and Valentine and Greave they're about to get you know they're about to get old but i like this Sandy Johnson  all right uh what kind of hobbies are you into well i'm quilting and uh pressing fact i was pressing a the uh pieces for a quilt block i will stop start stitching on when the phone rang okay so where uh what are you into woodwork uh no uh tole painting and uh oh folk art yeah i saw something uh you've seen these old wooden school desks the old ones uh um-hum i saw some uh or one anyway in a shop here oh i don't even remember where i was two or three weeks ago that had been uh painted with that looked like maybe just a flat finish and then tole painting on it and the uh flowers and borders and trims and stuff and it was just real pretty yeah yeah we we used to live in Hillsboro and i there's a a lady that i knew that had a uh gift shop and she gave art lessons and i've taken lessons there and got into it and tried a little bit of landscaping so painting is pretty interesting um-hum how long you been quilting quite a while or no not uh not a real long time since about um i guess it was in probably nineteen eighty eight when i got into it and i belong to a quilt guild in in McKinney we just meet once a month but uh we've had a project going this last almost a year now where we uh when i joined the quilt guild there was just i made the i think the thirteenth member and we just wrote down the names of the months and then we all drew for uh a month and everyone in the guild makes a block for the the person who's turn it is that month and we have the uh privilege of selecting a pattern or of colors or providing the material and the pattern or some of them just say uh for instance the December is what they call a Christmas sampler and she gave us one piece of uh fabric to use in it and then we have to come up with something else to go with it and when they're all put together needless to say they've got enough for a block and our guild has grown now to where we have twenty members um and so uh February is when i get the blocks and my husband has picked the the pattern that he wants and the colors so it'll be it'll be interesting yeah it sounds like it i've seen some beautiful quilts around i i've got some that my mother made and i still have oh goodness those are those are really family heirlooms and yeah i've got one that uh she made when i was a kid with the you know Raggedy Ann and Andy patterns on it uh-huh and it's some of the stitches you know have come loose on it but you know i still keep it though right do you work for Texas Instruments uh no i i work for JC Penney's uh the guy that i'm in a a scout troop at Saint Rita's church by uh 635 and the tollway uh-huh and uh John Godfrey that that TI who's doing this his son's in our scout troop and he contacted us and he he suggested that all the adult members do this and turn the money in that they collected for the phone calls to the troop so we you know pick up a little extra funds that way oh well that's good it really is that's a a good fund raiser yeah it's you know easy way to pick up maybe a thousand dollars and get enough adults involved um-hum yeah it has been pretty quiet on the switchboard lately uh for a while i was getting calls pretty often and then they when the switchboard went down for a while and then after it started up again well we haven't uh it hasn't been real active i was a little bit surprised when i uh picked up the phone tonight and got the recording you know that it was yeah was back on and i have lost the number in fact maybe you could give it to me that you call in uh to make to make a call okay okay you got a and uh just a let's see if i get over here where i can get to a pen um i may get an incoming call anytime but uh my husband  this area Dallas i'm born and raised here well great so who you want to talk about baseballwise may may as well talk about the Rangers the Rangers all right uh uh might as well well do you think they're going to get anyone in Florida uh i hope i hope they do they've uh i forgot who've they signed already did they sign that shortstop that was they were talking about some shortstop they were going to try to get in the free agency draft or the free agency market i don't know who they uh they they decide sign finally signed up Brian Downing i know for oh okay they're they're trying to get uh God what's his name what's that black man's name uh is he with them now yeah Ruben Ruben yeah they haven't they still haven't signed Ruben yet yeah no i heard that they're not going to talk to him till next week's now they talked to his agents today and then they're going to talk to them some more next week which i don't know whether that's good bad or indifferent because wish they'd get that out of the way and maybe he could do something else yeah i know well they said they made a mistake they made a mistake by uh not signing not signing him uh to a longer contract than what they did i know why do you think they did that oh they did did did it for economics but it's coming back and it's going to haunt them this year because he played such good ball the last couple of years uh-huh because now his uh his contracts say they i think they signed him for like three or four hundred thousand last year but now it's going to cost them somewhere about uh eight hundred thousand to a million is kind of oh you don't think he'll get that twenty seven million like that other guy just got i don't think so i don't he'll he's it's it's going to cost them though it's going to cost them but he's worth it that's true well do you think they need to fire Bobby Valentine's a good guy i don't know if he's i don't know he's he's done a lot for the team uh-huh he really has i think he's an excellent i think he's an excellent coach he's probably one of the best ones that they've had just because he's more consistent uh-huh he's more consistent than any other coach that we've had and had there in a long time and i i think he'll do some good he just needs a they just need to put together a good pitching staff and i think they'll go pretty good not have so many injuries yeah that was that's what killed them last year i went to a few went to a few of their games and it just uh the pitching was okay but it was i know it was inconsistent are you comfortable that Bobby Witt will be back or is he uh ever going to develop into a super pitcher uh i don't think he is i don't think he is what about Kevin Brown Kevin Brown uh he might he might he still he's still got a little learning to do yeah i thought maybe he would but i was kind of disappointed last year yeah i was disappointed the whole season so they they they started out i mean if they would have continued they went off that fourteen game losing streak or winning streak then they kind of hit the dumps there for a while well they yeah yeah but then all their pitchers were hurt so that that really hurts when you can't when all of the pitchers get hurt like that so yeah that's true you think they're going to do anything this year i don't know i uh uh i think they need a another arm and i'm still not sure that that new third baseman Dean Palmer is as good as they think he's going to be i think they made a mistake they made a mistake trading Buechele uh but well i don't think they uh think they knew they couldn't afford him and Ruben and they decided to go with Ruben because he yeah that's probably true but uh you know you got to you got to have more not one person's going to make the team yeah but they're not willing to pay big bucks it doesn't seem i think they'll have an exciting team last next next year and i just you know if they don't have any injuries but yeah uh Kansas City you know just signed a big time player so they're they're tough at signing all those people they got uh Joiner Wally Joiner from California so oh yeah that should help their team yeah it sounds like you keep up on baseball pretty well no i have one of those uh minds that remembers trivia that's of completely useless that what useless trivia yeah i mean something important i can't remember but something about baseball or football or something that really doesn't mean anything i can remember it's one of those weird things i don't know why you know and i can't find my car keys then but i can remember you know something that about sports that's not even important remember remember who Kansas City signed but you can't find your car keys that's right or my glasses yeah i know and and why why do i remember sports it's just one of those things i don't know why that if i can hear it on the radio and it just sinks in and that that's great well that's great i've never i've never had a decent conversation with a woman about baseball well well that's that's a yeah oh that's that's embarrassing almost but no i could probably name them almost the starting lineup for the Rangers until until now  well i guess we're supposed to talk about what's being done about recycling yes well lots right right finally really what what do you do now well we have saved our newspapers for years and years because the uh Boy Scouts our boys have been involved in have uh had a huge recycling bin over at Resurrection Lutheran Church um-hum um-hum um-hum and um so we've done that for quite some time but since the price of paper has gone down like it's about a fifth of what it used to be oh really so the Boy Scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over oh okay so now we just put ours out for the city of Plano do you live in Plano okay yeah yes i do yeah and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins have you had yours now yeah you right yes although just just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that um work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs oh that's why i asked you i guess it you know it does go in cycles and not everyone got theirs right away yeah like yeah yeah and i i was so relieved because i've been making a real concerted effort make you know recycling the aluminum and the newspapers and even got into plastic because Wal-Mart collected it uh-huh right yeah we used to take ours there and uh my garage was just getting overwhelmed and of course i didn't go weekly so it became quite a big thing and uh i know right right i'm really glad they do it um yeah i do newspapers mostly newspapers and um plastic two liter diet Coke bottles and aluminum cans some but i don't use as many of those yes yeah uh-huh i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that you have to really that are really dirty that you have to wash out yeah well i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two uh ha uh ha so it was wasting a lot of time wasting all your time and effort and putting it in there yeah thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned yeah yeah but uh you know but it it's not that hard now that i've got this system under control yeah got your routine down yeah well i guess there are some places um in the north in particular that um have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle because they charge you let's see they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight ah uh-huh so if you recycle things of course then you don't have all that weight in there yeah i do find that i don't have as much to throw away because all the bulky things are are being tossed in with the recycling and uh right that's right yeah yeah i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than uh what are some of the things they don't recycle oh one thing i thought about the other day were batteries just everyday regular batteries hm supposedly you know leak and and contaminate the landfills and yet what am i going to do when i have a couple double A batteries to toss out and they don't take right yeah right probably going to throw them in your trash yeah that's what happens because well there are places that take car batteries but i wonder if they would take yeah i mean not that it would kind of a pain to you know drive over somewhere special just for that for two little tiny batteries but yeah yeah but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something yeah that's true uh if they've got these bins for all the other little items i'm sure if people people will have batteries uh you know quite often to to toss out right that's true um when i was home those few days around Thanksgiving and the um the truck came by well we all ran out to watch it because you know we'd never really seen it pick up our stuff and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he uh scanned across the little bar code on our bin uh-huh oh oh is that right as soon as he took the stuff and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just you know scanned it so i don't know why what that was reading it for huh but um they must be trying to keep track of you know who is doing it or what i guess i don't know another registering our garbage yeah wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year oh for those who are really cooperating now that would encourage it yeah well except i know it would just not be cost effective they've already got all this money out on hired um getting the trucks and hiring people to work them i'm sure they couldn't afford that but um sure sure but the garbage um now there is just one garbage man that comes yeah oh yeah on the truck instead of two so that's interesting um also slightly off the subject but our our big green garbage thing got stolen oh it did goodness uh-huh and we called we called the city and um they they brought us a new one and they did not charge us and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen oh my goodness it is sad you know they paid for those things anyway or our taxes do isn't that sad you know it just oh and they must be yeah really expensive i mean of course we were hoping we weren't we weren't going to have to pay for it you know but i mean what would somebody do with them um-hum oh how there  so how do you feel about capital punishment well i i'm not really certain how i uh i i'm not certain that it does does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that that have capital punishment right you don't think penalties yet on the other hand uh i don't know i mean there's things that seems like it's it's it's the right thing to do now you know i mean somebody as serial serial serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard you kind of i don't know what about yourself i uh um i have a the same dilemma i think um it's it's you know it seems right sometimes and then other times you don't know um uh-huh i mean people like i it's been shown i mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up uh having effective effective effective punishments and and they're they're extremely severe um i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesn't serve as a deterrent uh may be because you you you you never know if it's gonna be applied applied right unlike unlike uh like in in Arab societies if you got get caught stealing they chop off your hand and and you walk around the rest of your life with one hand and then everybody knows exactly what what for right right um right and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can you can kind of always count on the fact you know or or there's a good chance you're gonna get off and so um-hum and also it doesn't seem like it does them any harm i mean sure their life is taken but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so i think sometimes they'd prefer just to uh-huh get it over with so it's more of the easy way out than yeah some people making them pay for the consequences for the yeah you know what they've done except that you know i mean the the average cost to society to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is is extremely high i mean something i i was amazed at a uh per year it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year yeah to keep people in jail uh you know i mean that's sort of a uh sort of a crass perspective i mean on the usage of capital punishment but on the other hand uh um um-hum you know i don't i don't know if if it's a crime that's that's that serious that they're really never gonna be out of jail um right but then again also you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway so um it's it doesn't it seems by that by i don't know doesn't ever really pay um oh i know i mean you can't it doesn't taking taking one more life doesn't doesn't doesn't get replace you know get things back the way they were right yeah i don't know i i don't know i really don't know uh i'm in Texas yeah right it doesn't bring back every what state are you in oh really in Dallas where where no i'm in Austin oh really and where are you where are you calling from um right now i'm in Utah but i'm from Plano Texas oh i see uh-huh so um yeah so you um what are the laws like in Texas it's it is Texas is has has is one of the one of the states well i guess there's more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment um Texas has had it for a while it's one of the quicker it once it was uh it was reallowed i think it was outlawed for a while by the by the supreme court i mean or or the interpretation of the constitution and it seems like everybody stopped and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again oh really they do it by uh by lethal do it by lethal injection so you know uh-huh i'm originally from Kansas and in Kansas also uh they they almost immediately put back capital punishment and uh there they do it by hanging wow still right they have i still remember the the the movie uh In Cold Blood i don't know if you've ever i i i'm sure you're familiar with it but have you seen the movie i haven't no yeah the way and they do it that way yeah well they they show it not not i mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty two or something like that and so it's uh it's not particularly graphic but on the other hand it's huh it's fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows it's a kind of a barn like structure wow yeah i think that they're i think that capital punishment is is is um in tact in Utah also i'm not really familiar with is that right are you there in school yeah uh-huh yeah yeah i am so but i think that they do well well long time ago i can i remember my dad was telling me this i think that um they do it by like a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it so they don't know who killed uh-huh has has a yeah has has a real bullet and the rest of them have blanks right yeah i think yeah i i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner i know that i've always said that if i if i had to kill and clean and my own my own meat i think i'd become a vegetarian yeah i know i know as as long as you're sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so not so bad i guess but  okay but you said you saw Robin Hood yes i did this summer did you see it also yeah i sure did of course i'm a Kevin Costner fan as are a lot of women well i i saw i guess i've seen all of Kevin's movies so far yeah have you are you planning to see the his new one the JFK well probably i want to see what the reviews look like yeah i usually wait for the reviews too although sometimes i've gone and i disagree you know with them not usually the paper as much as the ones on radio and TV i don't always agree with them well sometimes it's a matter of what the movie is about um-hum even if it doesn't get a good review if it's something i'm interested in i'll probably go see it anyway oh like the man on the uh i think it's KRLD that reviews movies gave uh Star Trek the new movie uh like a four or five and i was surprised because everyone that's a Star Trek fan that i know that has seen it just loved it well i've i've read some reviews on Star Trek and was planning to see it Wall Street Journal has a review today and it says basically that uh that this is probably just about the best one that they've ever done um-hum so don't you think again it's a matter of opinion sure it finishes by if this is indeed the final voyage of the original crew Star Trek six is a worthy valediction uh i don't like always to listen to what someone else says uh because i think sometimes they just don't happen to or if you know if you're real tired sometimes something doesn't appeal to you well that that can be the case or it can get a great review and be something that i'm not interested in then i'm not going to see it that's right i've seen a couple like that uh you haven't seen Cape Fear yet no i've been reading all the reviews about it but i've never seen it oh it is very very frightening i mean i think it's more so than Silence of the Lambs it's a little bit like that did you see Silence of the Lambs no but i read all about it too yeah well it was pretty gory and so was Cape Fear real kind of gruesome but you know that's kind of like when is he going to die and probably never well this movie Hook is getting interesting reviews some are saying that it too sweet uh just because they spent so much money on it and it's got such well-known stars i'm thinking about seeing it which one is that it's called Hook it's Hook yes again i've heard mixed reviews on that you know i think this morning KRLD had a gave it a a six or something which for him is probably pretty good well the newspaper suggested that it's perhaps too sweet a movie and and that the action sequences might not be as good as other Spielberg's movies but it might not be bad overall i guess there'll never be another ET no i know that was a classic and i'm glad they didn't try to follow up with a sequel sometimes it ruins it well no ET ET ET is going is is to stood as an instant classic well i think so uh it was on what Thanksgiving i was in Florida and i watched it again have you seen The Butcher's Wife no that's the one with Demi Moore uh-huh yeah i've i've been reading about it but i wasn't all that interested Jeff well Jeff Daniels is in that too isn't he but i i wasn't interested um-hum he does put in a real good the it's a real lighthearted movie if you're uh in the mood to see something just kind of lighthearted you would like it isn't a real thoughtful picture just kind of fun fun you know once in a while it's nice to just go see something that's just lighthearted and fun well sometimes there two kind of movies i like to see the ones on the big screen like Star Trek where you really have to see them on big screen and then the others like say The Butcher's Wife that are interesting but you can rent them later and watch them on TV without any harm by watching on video that's true you know and you have to start thinking about is it is it worth spending the money to go see it or shall i just wait well you know Star Wars Star Trek those kind of movies you've got to see them on big screen or else they lose their effect um-hum they really do and i've never been a Star Trek fan but i have friends and relatives that wouldn't miss a Star Trek movie well i i've enjoyed Star Trek but i got people who are friends who are fanatics i have a friend who took off work last Friday just to be sure to be in the first group to see it well i'll see i'll see it eventually but i'm not going take the rush um yeah well and sometimes you know you miss all the crowds if you don't have to go the very first day it opens no i i i think it'll still be playing next month yeah yeah i think so i don't think you need to be one of the first uh do you belong to any of the fan clubs uh you know the oh no no i'm i'm just it's just interesting to watch um-hum although there's a big story in the paper today a debate between two of the writers one saying the original crew was best and one saying that the new crew was best but uh you know the debate goes on i suppose yes well it'd be interesting to hear why people think that  okay um capital punishment i i know that's kind of a touchy subject i i personally believe that there is a need for capital punishment um especially you know in some of the the real violent type murder and and crimes i feel like that it's a it's a justifiable punishment do you i certainly agree with that we have Dallas has now become one of the most crime oh our crime rate has just exceeded all oh possible goals or whatever and we keep coddling all of our our men or women incarcerated we have to have certain amount of space for them oh dear oh um-hum i'm with i think we just must keep this capital punishment and i don't believe keeping them on death row for four or five years is answering any of our problems um-hum i agree i think it just it jams up the system and you know we spend thousands and thousands of dollars keeping them there and that's right and i feel that yeah it's not fair to the public and it's it i think it's a terrible shame well it's not fair to the taxpayers that's right so um now do you have um what types of capital punishment do they use or in Texas what is legal um the lethal dose of uh you know slip in it i think they maybe should get back to courtyard hangings right uh-huh oh no no i don't really mean that but if people could see what was really happening oh i think it would deter this more than than going in with the needle and injecting them um-hum um-hum now we in Utah they have uh either the firing squad or the lethal injection are the two methods that are that are used here and i know um not too long ago it's probably been two or three years now that um one of the people chose to die by the firing squad and and i well i think that was the last one that died here was by the firing squad and um so i know those are the two forms of punishment they use now but you know just the other day we had a uh man that was on death row for for killing his sister-in-law and her fifteen month old baby and then they came just two days ago and and said that something had not been done right with the trial and so now they've they've just have have to start all over again go through the same process all over again and oh i think that's ridiculous i just um-hum what a waste of money and time and resources and you know oh that's right since our have you ever served on a jury no i have not that is one of the most um well i think everyone should at least once oh it was uh i've never been on capital punishment but um i wonder if these people were guilty until proven innocent if we would not gain or more from our attorneys um-hum um-hum oh i don't know i don't know i i've been called to trial duty but i never they canceled it you know before i got there so i've never never had that yeah well it certainly is a responsibility yes but i think that uh we need to demand more from our attorneys when they withhold information we have three cases going here in Dallas now um-hum um-hum two of them were murder the well finally the husband admitted to having smothered his wife even though he loved her dearly oh no oh so he goes up for forty years with with a possibility of being out in ten um-hum and the other man is charged with um poisoning his wife with arsenic oh no and it was a a apparently it went on over a year they're a very wealthy family oh uh-huh and uh oh it just boy it it you know um-hum you wonder why why this happens yes well i don't know about your situation there but here in Utah they're we're having to build new prisons because there is no place to put to put these inmates they're just the prisons are so full and so we're spending more and more money building new ones when when all these you know inmates are on death row and yeah that's just you know well we let our our previous governor wanted to put a tent uh you know just build oh  okay i now say Arlington Texas since the other day i said that and somebody said well i'm in Arlington Virginia oh well that is a different thing isn't it yeah i was really surprised then i got one person from Utah but usually it's just right around here sure well what what do you like in a restaurant well i guess i'd i thought well i guess i'd have to say the food well i know number one that's definitely it you know if the food's good then that's you know that sort of makes my decision i you know if i really have something good although okay the food and then the other thing i'd say is atmosphere's real important to me you know i don't like really noisy places and um-hum you know yeah you know i used to like to go to Friday's because i like kind of lively fun places and the last time we went there it was so horrendously noisy that i don't know if i'll ever go back it was awful yes well when a when a i know one of my pet peeves is that you know they have the music on so loud and then people have to talk loud and then it's just so noisy that you can't visit um-hum that's right oh i know you know and normally when i'm eating out i you know with people and i wanna sit and talk i mean that's the half the fun is the conversation right right you know and i don't mind some noise but if it's bearable for me so um i really think American restaurants are all overall getting noisy and noisy people just screaming i say that because i the time i was in Europe years ago you could be in a tiny little restaurant everyone talked lower they still seemed to have fun i'd uh-huh well i don't know why i in fact i've been to places where i've asked them to turn the music down and and they say well they you know they can't that that's the the atmosphere they want to promote and i i don't understand that um-hum i don't either you know it's like that doesn't make sense to me what you know what is the fun of that i know i can't and uh another one you can tell i go to cheap restaurants now that i have a daughter in college and i'm going we we go all the cheapies but uh we go to Cheddar's a lot there's one by us uh-huh and they'll just blast the TV where in the bar where you have to wait till they call your name you know and and i'm not that excited about some baseball game or whatever they're um-hum right it's just so loud you can't even visit while you're having a drink or anything well another thing that is not my favorite thing is um you know like if they have um birthdays and then they all scream you know clap and scream to birthday i get tired of that too oh they all screaming run screaming in and singing yes they do too i think so you know that that uh the atmosphere does make a difference but usually i tend to go well for two reasons i go for the food also thinking now there's certain types of restaurants that i like you know like i love Mexican food and so i go to i like Mexican food restaurants um um-hum um-hum right so i would go for that um i think did i say what kind of restaurants do you prefer or do you oh golly uh i like most kinds of food really i'd never go to a barbecue place i mean i i don't mind barbecue but that's one that we just don't go out to uh-huh but what you know i like Italian and Mexican and i love French and um-hum um we don't i don't even think we have a Greek restaurant in Arlington we uh i used to go to a Greek restaurant over in Dallas couple of them i thought they were great uh-huh um i like most everything i like seafood too course it's hard to get my husband to a seafood restaurant but another thing to consider is the uh help you know yeah um-hum uh their attitude right uh uh i think and uh i i agree some of them you know they come up with all this phony stuff too hi my name's Bill i'm your waiter for the night oh God i'm tired of that right right right just wait on me and right i don't care about right we don't have to exchange backgrounds but um price is something to consider i'll be happy that's true that's true um and i and i generally speaking go to moderately priced places you know places and it does matter um but you know depending upon what my budget is for the week as to where i go i guess um but that's yeah that's right i uh price is definitely a consideration right uh the more expensive the restaurant the more i want the have the waiters to really wait on you and be good you know remember uh-huh well they should be i mean in theory i guess really really i think so well we went to New Orleans this fall and talk about great restaurants oh yes there's probably no place better i i you know the food in New Orleans is just fabulous oh oh i know and uh really we we went to Commander's Palace and oh and you know supposed to be one of the better ones in America and uh our dinner that night you could choose one that had like four courses and it was thirty nine dollars a dinner but my gosh it was worth it it was just beautiful surrounding and at one time there was five people waiting on our table yeah yes yeah i've been there it yes i have oh really that's the first time i i'd been in New Orleans before it was the first time i'd eaten there and i thought it was worth every penny ah it is it's a fabulous place and uh i really enjoyed that then i'd enjoy that more than Brennan's uh-huh i think it's better uh-huh but still Brennan's is so lovely and the service is so wonderful well they're all lovely i mean basically you just can't go wrong and um the food is just so good i i i i love New Orleans and i that's true oh i know and they're lighthearted people there but exactly it's just a  well uh see what type of car do i want well i'd like to have a Corvette oh wow but my uh weekly wages don't apply for me to have that kind of car so yeah uh i'm engaged to get married so i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons right yeah and um so uh to drive back and forth to work is all i need a car for pretty much and we have a truck so probably a economic size car will work um what kind of um car do you have now right now i have a eighty seven Cavalier um it's a piece of my car is really old too because um i drive out of town a lot of the weekends and um uh-huh i would like my next car to have good gas mileage right and um same here um you know a nice car American made and um you know and a nice car but not too expensive because um i couldn't afford like a brand new like Bamorghini or something i would like to but while we're talking right while we're talking my next car i'd like to be sporty and you know nice but you know it's expensive and then insurance is really high for that too so right oh i know something with a that's not too sporty because of insurance then right that insurance does come into play i forgot about that yeah so what kind of insurance do y'all have up there mean is it real high up there um no mine just got lowered because i just turned twenty one and um i'm not sure oh really how much i pay i just my mom's helping me out you know because i'm a college i'm in college and um so i just give her the money and and take her word for it right right i know insurance is high dollars yeah yeah it is so and that the more expensive the car the higher it is so but right i mean unless i win the lottery i won't be buying anything too expensive i don't plan on buying a car for many many years so right right so i have to make this one last as long as i can yep what's everybody drive up there uh in Kenosha i mean in Wisconsin they drive them little four wheelers or four wheel drive or do y'all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything oh it just is yeah we we have a Jeep with four wheel drive because um because of the snow you mean or right it never snows down here so well we don't have any snow here now it all melted yeah there's no snow at all really we haven't had snow yet we usually only get it like once a year or so huh kind of strange to y'all huh yeah yeah it is because how it it's like seventy degrees here right now oh don't tell me that that's nice yep how how cold is it there well actually it's been warm it's in the forties really yeah and that's that's really warm hm um and it's supposed to rain tomorrow so we i've only seen snow once this year and and it was really bad and then it all melted like within the week really and now there's no snow so huh but hm so what what's your dream car um i haven't really thought about i'm not too big on cars i mean i don't know the names and stuff but if i were to go to a car lot and like look at them i would pick out one that you know looked really nice um-hum what's your favorite color um for a car yeah probably blue blue like if it you know was just a average middle class car but if i were to get a sports car maybe white or red or right right yeah so what kind of car do you drive right now um it's a Skyhawk Buick eighty three i think really really yeah oh it like eighty two thousand miles really yeah i'm afraid it's not gonna last me that long and i hope it does though oh yeah it's a two door i like i i like smaller cars uh they're i find them more comfortable to drive right so everybody have their windows tinted up there um no i don't see too many cars tinted everybody has their tinted down here oh i'm sure yeah i could i could see why so you been down here before yep um really did you like it it was busy yep it was nice i remember um yeah it's different i bet huh swimming on Easter day and it was like really cold up here but came back with a little tan so that was nice right it's like you know everybody freaks out when it snows  okay we're supposed to talk about vacations right so um well uh what kind of vacations do you like well uh i haven't been to many places but i have a opportunity to go to uh Paris France um with um with my friend in April she is her um her family you know lives there and she's only been there once her grandmother lives there so i'm hoping to go i'm praying i get to go um um-hum oh that great yeah it's that will be probably the most exciting place i'll ever get to go um-hum have you ever been to um like New Mexico um no actually oh why have you i was just curious i was just wondering what it was like oh okay no um no i have been to Europe once and to Haiti and um yeah Tahiti Tahiti huh no no Haiti oh Haiti right where's that it's um well it's in the Caribbean and it's the western half of an island with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic um-hum and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country most of them third world countries um-hum and study the language and then do a little service project hm so yeah that turned out to be a really good experience for me so what did you do when you were in Europe um well see i went there when i was in high school actually and i mostly went to Germany and visited some friends of my family uh-huh and um hung out with them worked a bit on one of their farms and i also went to a youth camp what did you do on the farm um uh uh well not that much just uh oh you just kind of sight just kind of uh right i mean i wasn't a great asset to them or anything but i you know drove a tractor helped them weed beets and that sort of thing um and um yep and i went to a youth camp thing included working at an old people's home and that was pretty interesting and while i was there i visited my aunt and uncle who were staying for their vacation in France in Nantes which is on the west coast like right across from England um um so uh where in France are you Paris right Paris and um yeah hum how long do you plan to be going for uh two weeks last time she stayed two months but we're only going to stay two weeks um-hum great so and uh we're going to take a cooking class there so that might be fun a what cooking class you know French cooking oh great yeah and um what else are you planning to do if anything museums you know go to museums and um-hum yeah did you go to museums in Europe um-hum um actually no i don't think i went to any of them uh the closest thing i did was go some like uh restored castles and stuff that there is some on that west coast of France um and i went to a vineyard or two in Germany um that's neat yeah that was nice um hum but so um say what about have you ever been to Hawaii uh no i haven't have you no no okay well um well where have you gone first i'm wanting to go there oh God where have i gone if anywhere um yeah i mean well what'd you  well do you do any recycling um we do here um see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins yeah and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and um plastic bottles and i think that's all they have oh what about you guys well we uh there's a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is uh aluminum cans uh-huh but uh we've got a we've got a couple of different things uh places uh they're like unattended aluminum can smashers and you can go up there and and uh redeem we've got one that gives you like a penny a can really for smashed cans so if you yeah well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed uh-huh and uh when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot oh can you can you hold on for just a minute i'm gonna try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because okay just a second sure okay okay oh okay well i guess well i heard it that i heard it that time i guess yeah okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can well when you buy like um canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit uh no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that yeah exactly and so it's like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed you're just like reimbursed oh okay okay no they don't charge us that extra nickel type of thing that's sort of nice though yeah it it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like uh um a twelve pack then that's like twelve cents back uh-huh yeah so you guys can actually get ahead yeah but uh they have sort of like uh things that you can you're not like reimbursed for or paid for like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass yeah um and milk jugs and um newspapers you know everyone does newspapers yeah yeah everybody does newspapers but that that kind of stuff yeah but they they said they can't be smashed or else um it doesn't fit in their little containers and they're not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh Pepsi cans and whatever up there yeah exactly yeah send it to this address no but um let's see they said that how ways we can encourage recycling um i i i tell you what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some even even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it uh yeah that's in other words uh taking care of the environment is is all well and good um-hum but if it's gonna cost you to take care of the environment they're not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh as if you get something back for it as likely to do it yeah you know and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if there's some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer yeah that's true you know it kind of reminds me of using an ATM card you know to get money or doing your banking you know if it's free people will use it if it costs them something then they're not as likely to use it uh-huh yeah yeah exactly you know but uh i know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars uh-huh and just putting it down the drain you know the sewer the drain sewer yeah and uh all that because there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the rest their old oil down there now they're starting to recycle that stuff uh-huh oh that's good um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other and one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops yeah and that way you know you don't get near enough as as much as you bought it for but you you got the use out of it and what you're gonna basically donate to to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for yeah yeah and so that's something that i've never i we're we're new to Iowa and so that's something that i hadn't you know looked into before but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess yeah i know the a lot of places they um uh  okay okay i guess we're ready to start well i guess what part of what part of the country do you live in oh okay well i'm also in Dallas i'm in Dallas Texas what about yourself okay the reason i ask is the last two conversations i've had or have been out of state uh-huh but um have you always lived here in Dallas and no i've lived here for almost five years now i see and i'm a uh before that i was at school in Rochester New York and i'm originally from Boston oh well you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood that's right but i like it you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow well i missed it at first but now i go back there and i'm a real wimp about the cold so i like it here it's nice yeah well that's good i i have lived in Texas essentially all my life and around in Texas and and um-hum uh i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it but uh um-hum i don't know i'm not sure i would want to take on those winters i'm getting older and i know uh not sure that's really something i wanna do i live uh over in the Lake Highlands area if you're familiar with that area yeah um tell me where that is um okay uh you i probably do know but i don't know by that name this is pretty well where LBJ and Audelia Skillman cross okay sure we're just north of uh White Rock Lake oh okay yeah i know that area that's a nice area well we have some very nice house homes here in this area um my particular i guess they want us to describe the area so um my particular area the homes run anywhere from about sixty five eighty thousand dollars on up to probably half a million uh-huh oh that's quite a range yes um the homes that were here earlier were smaller now they've gotten larger and larger as as they've developed the land and of course it's pretty static right now and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy uh-huh yeah how about you well i am um i'm gosh i'm barely in Dallas i'm just north of Addison Airport up on the tollway okay uh okay and i guess we have a similar situation i mean we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy eighty thousand and then we've got Bent Tree right across the street um-hum okay so i don't i don't even know how high those go but some of those are pretty big yes those are over a million yeah so it's that's the strange thing about i guess Dallas because back where i'm from you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a a couple miles so well we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in Dallas not as bad as Houston yeah but exactly what you're describing is what happens all over um-hum yeah i've noticed that well now do you live in a a home or a zero lot home or um-hum uh we've got a house let's see we moved in about four years ago and it was it had previously been unoccupied but it had existed for three years this is a whole block of homes that uh a builder built all of them and i guess he he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away okay type of deal so the whole block was all foreclosed oh and so some were vacant for quite a while before they you know they finally sold them because there were so many well your was your house in good shape was it damaged yeah no the only thing that we were worried about was the air conditioner because they'd have it just running constantly with the doors and windows open oh it was oh but uh yeah so we just you know we bargained to get an extra warranty on that i see and um we're really we haven't had any problems and you know we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the Northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything but the prices are much lower here and this was definitely not a fix up special but i'll tell you it takes all my time between we put in our own sprinkler system and i just finished repainting the exterior and you know making drapes and buying furniture it's just a money pit really is yes i so am familiar with that i where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it uh-huh and we bought it from someone who was in it but before they had it i found out after i had been in the house it had it had sat empty for the better part of a year uh-huh and i'm not sure what happened but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for for about four years oh no i i i found a lot of things which  okay Brian hi how you doing Kevin fine thanks good good glad to hear that i understand are are you a total banner total banner no i i believe that uh the American public and i as an individual and private citizen have a right to to bear arms and to have a gun as long as i uh am responsible with it yeah and protect the safety and welfare of my kids and and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it i think that education with a gun is is critical and important um however i do believe that uh guns ought to be maintained and and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to get seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns and in the heat of the moment they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people so on a scale of one to ten i i think i would rate myself as a in the six or seven or eight no but i think that there ought to be some control but i still think that uh individuals have a right how do you feel about it okay well so let me make sure so so you think that uh maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate well i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate uh that uh that might cool down some tempers i think a a one day would be sufficient the reason i say that is there's an awful lot of people who go to gun shows and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun if that five day waiting period were in effect that you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show uh you just you'd be able to buy it but they'd just have to mail it to you i suppose huh well i don't think you can mail thing guns through the mail i don't know i think that's a against the law ever since Kennedy was oh okay well assassinated so how do you feel about guns oh really let's see i think that gun control has come up because there's been some crazies that killed people with guns and i think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault whether you know um-hum well do you think that there will continue to always be crazies sure then uh how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns well we have some laws on the books that uh don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns if i understand correctly and uh i would agree a a short waiting period would be appropriate to uh take care of the heat of the moment type things but um-hum uh i think banning semiautomatic twenty two rifles is a a bit on the extreme side um-hum and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway okay do you uh do you feel that there is a need in the world today to have a an automatic handgun the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people in my opinion or or you could do it just for fun you know kind of like a game but uh well i think that the the police uh or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves but the public i don't know i think that i should have a right to own a handgun not a automatic semiautomatic um-hum yeah not an Uzi no no uh but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves um-hum you saw Indiana Jones the guy came after him with that big knife yes and just he took care of him just one shot yes that's true and he uh saved himself in the in the in the process also that's right so how's work going very fine very very they don't let you take guns to work do they no they that's uh that's prohibited where we work although down here in Texas uh you do have a right to to wear and carry arms with you at all times uh-huh that's still uh that's still you can still do that down here can they be is it concealed or does it have to oh you can't no it it should not be concealed has to be on the hip it has to be on the hip has to be in sight so that uh yeah that you're not uh a menace or a problem to individuals how about where you live there in Utah can a  well seems to me the one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process well i agree with the boredom of the election process but i also uh think that people don't realize that their boat vote will make a difference uh they feel like that you know it's going to go however it's going to go and their one little vote's not going to make that much difference and it's just why make the effort well sometimes strangely enough one vote has made the difference well i agree with that and i and i do know that you you know all those votes are counted and and they do make a difference um also i think that people have a tendency to to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the the more local elections well it's kind of strange because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their day-to-day lives exactly exactly and uh i i even have a tendency to do that myself and i have to really make a concerted effort to to get involved i lived i live in a suburb in Mesquite and uh so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me but i i think on the whole most people don't uh feel that way or don't even look even look at that i think they just don't even i i don't think they're conscious of it well main part of the problem is they don't they think they have enough choices well that may be true too i hadn't thought of that you know in some of the European countries they have numbers of parties that run and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country um-hum right and sometimes it's uh well not sometimes but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign and and issues get uh bogged down well maybe it's a matter of you know voter awareness um i think voter awareness i worked i did some work for the uh Women's League of uh Voters uh several years ago and i think there are some organizations that used to uh do some voter awareness uh things don't they don't get a lot of participation they don't get a lot of uh activity most of the League of Women Voters what they did was they put out information so that it it would just be made available to everyone now other areas that i've worked in like in the chambers they would just have the candidates come and it would just you know that was not a lot lot of community involvement and those were people that would mostly vote anyway well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in Britain you know they have a set period of time and and for campaign that's it in this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign it's a it's an ongoing campaign and it's expensive campaign and it it uh eliminates a lot of qualified people uh maybe more qualified and uh more dedicated uh uh to the issues well the they don't want to spend the time or they don't have the money exactly exactly and it it i i can't believe i just can't believe i've i've worked in a couple of local campaigns i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally well it's a matter of name recognition people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of oh well i agree with that but also and i and i'm not for controlling controlling how much is spent but do you know that's one thing if a if the time wasn't so if it wasn't such a long uh campaigning time then they couldn't spend as much money and even debates don't seem to help much no they really don't uh it's always it's a lot of it is who looks the best who uh who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not not it who may not be the most qualified and can get the uh the job done so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers exactly and it's a it's a lot i've worked in public relations a lot and uh that kind of thing can make and break make or break you as you can remember uh Clayton Williams' campaign well that was certainly a media event it really was and it's just uh uh he possibly could have uh won that election had it not been for some of the the uh the way he presented himself well he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease hoof is is i guess the right term for him  so are are you a news person uh i really am i enjoy i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although you know i'm a full-time student and i work full-time too so or not full-time but i work quite a bit and so so i mostly depend on the radio yes you know on the way to work i like i like to listen to National Public Radio uh All Things Considered yes great show yeah and i like to listen to that and catch you know you i don't get i don't get a lot of uh sometimes i don't get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with uh you know some important issue on the day but yeah so so the real the real current news and the hard news yeah is is not a there's not really enough of it there right that's right yeah yeah i've had i've had that frustration too and i end up switching stations from time to time yeah yeah do you like you like NPR's uh programming uh in general you know um i watch yeah uh-huh a lot of CNN uh and C-SPAN um-hum um-hum um well i i subscribe to three newspapers um-hum um you know i sort of can't get enough of this yeah and and i when i travel elsewhere i'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have how how how oh yeah oh yeah of of world world events and national events well in in Dallas what are the what is the newspaper situation well we don't we we have a a big newspaper situation uh because we used to have two newspapers up until uh last Sunday and a uh major um a one of our major papers just closed down they closed shop and said well we can't put any more papers out and we're done hm was was that the the better paper or compared to the the other yeah i thought so it was a it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned it it had uh uh it got to the news you know and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy um-hum uh which i like i don't i don't like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the the politically uh weighted information you know for the for a different section i like just to get to the you know find out what's happening yes pretty quick uh and i feel that the other newspaper uh uh the Times the Dallas Morning News is the one that's still here the Times Herald is the one that closed up um-hum and uh the the Morning News was was is is okay but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i'm concerned you know many times it doesn't doesn't reflect my own opinion and um-hum but if you if you were to look at the front page of today's Morning News Morning Times rather uh would would you would you see things about what's going on in Europe um-hum no no that's the problem uh you you know you see you see Troy Aikman's knee surgery on the front page you know oh whoever Troy Aikman is yeah yeah a a quarterback for the Broncos or for the for the Cowboys uh you know you know you know what i mean that there's uh local news that okay yeah uh that really a lot of times doesn't doesn't change change my life one way or the other so uh yeah i guess it's current events but not the kind of current events that changes the world right right yeah not something you'll you'll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means yeah you know how how about you uh i guess in Washington D C you guys have several papers that are pretty yes um i i rather like the Washington Post pretty effective don't you yeah but i also get the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal uh-huh uh and you know each of them covers different things in in different different different in different ways and so it's right right uh you know if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspective clearly would have a different perspective on the world right yeah uh i i i have a question uh does does does the Wall Street Journal uh i i've kind of gathered lately that uh maybe their information is not just only related to business is that is that a correct assumption that that that is certainly true um uh-huh they will they will have articles like a few days ago they had a a nice article on Einstein you know theory of relativity oh oh you know that started on the front page and ran ran in into the full almost full page inside uh-huh now these are feature kind of articles all all the all the um wow you know the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities right but but there's some very good other articles um-hum uh you'll find in the in the Journal um-hum do you find that you're uh uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news um i wish it were in more depth um that doesn't mean to say longer just more facts would be nice um-hum um-hum um-hum um CNN has has you know was was pretty good during the war oh yeah definitely um and they were you know sort of had a unique vantage point for for doing that reporting um-hum but you know it's not it's it's uh never quite  where did you go on your last vacation um let's see uh the last vacation i started to started to take i say uh was with a friend of mine uh we were going to go down to uh South Padre and we got down there and it was rainy and yucky and we decided just turn around and come back oh now that's someplace i've never been i'd like to go down there yeah it's see i've only only lived here in Texas for two years so i haven't had a chance to go down there yeah yes it's it's a it's a really fun place it's as long as it's not raining yeah what do you do down there oh sit out by the little on the beach yeah yeah and uh there's lots of really good places to eat and uh well i haven't really had a chance to check out any of the the real entertainment or anything but uh uh it's there's lots of you know areas to do things on South Padre itself yeah hm well i'm getting ready to go to Arizona for Christmas and in in New Mexico we're going to do some skiing so i'm real anxious to do that i have never been skiing oh it's a lot well last year was the first time i've ever gone and it was so much fun i really enjoyed it i took a lesson the first day and then the second day i was up on the beginer's slope but it looks it it you think that that uh you wonder what those people are doing on the mountain you know but you get up there yourself and it's so much fun um-hum yeah makes makes you feel like a kid again and the good people make it look easy yeah you're going hey how do i stand up bump so i'm really anxious to go skiing again yeah yeah you you remember how you were when you were a kid and you went down a sled yeah well that's the way you feel on skis that's how i felt when i tried to go water when i the first time i went water skiing so oh now see i haven't done that yeah i haven't been water skiing water water skiing's a blast yeah you just a a little bit of of uh upper arm stamina just to to hold on to the ropes so the boat doesn't jerk your arms out of socket and um you have a lot of fun yeah yeah well where all have you been on vacation have you been to Disneyland oh with with my family i've gone down to Florida i think it i think they have the Disneyworld down there yeah i haven't been down there long before they ever put in EPCOT Center and all the fun stuff oh and uh i've been to Washington DC and and all oh now see i haven't been there either all all through that area uh and i've been up through the Yellowstone and all the national parks up that way gee you've been around a lot yeah and we went as far as Canada on that trip and i've been all over Texas there's there's there's nowhere in Texas i haven't been i don't think except some of the far west Texas little pin holes yeah yeah have you been to Carlsbad Caverns yeah i've been there yeah well at least once uh the the only place i haven't been really is California and New York well you didn't miss anything i've been to both places you didn't miss anything the the two yeah the the just lots of people the only thing that really i've i've been in California but i've never vacationed there got on an airplane here in Dallas and landed in California and uh then got on a cruise ship went up and down the coast a couple of times oh shoot you went on a cruise yeah my you've done everything my parents took me on a cruise when i was in the sixth grade it was such a good deal they just couldn't pass it up yeah yeah it it wasn't that great of a cruise actually it was it was seven days and i was fairly bored at at my age it it wasn't that much fun because there weren't a lot of kids on there at that time of year i was it was during the school year so yeah yeah oh but i'll bet it was interesting out there on the boat in the water and everything yeah yeah seeing the dolphins and stuff like that it was great at the time though because i got out of school for a week yeah you still uh-huh you still learned a lot well then you haven't been to Disneyland in California then have you no i haven't well now that's someplace you should go hum-um that's really neat yeah i moved over there i lived there for a little while real close to there and we would we would just like five miles from there and we would drive down there and yeah and the kids they i have two sons and they were on the newspaper route and they'd keep giving them uh passes to get in  we're set okay what changes do you feel have happened oh i guess the first thing has been the right for the right for women to vote i think that has been a major change and also the fact that um there are so much many more women in the work force nowadays than there were and that's probably going to increase you know right increases increases each year doesn't it i'm sorry it increases each year i think it sure does yeah there's a lot more women in the work place nowadays well and i think women have kind of had uh in the past the real subservient role role right and uh that's changing uh well we we still do to some degree but uh right uh i think it's not as much as it was yeah right yeah i i agree it i and especially i think with women increasingly working they're going to have to demand more from men because there's just impossible impossible to keep up on everything else definitely has changed uh-huh yeah yeah have more of an active role in taking care of children more of an active role in taking care of the home well you know they've been talking about and i don't know um what the status is on it but you know women get maternity leave and stuff like that and i know that they've there's been discussion about men also getting maternity leave right to help out but you know i haven't really heard much about that recently well you know there's a lot of companies that won't give maternity women maternity leave for that very reason uh-huh uh in fact i know the school districts down here you they don't have maternity leave um you simply have to take accumulate accumulate your sick leave oh is that right oh and take your sick leave uh-huh and i don't know uh if bigger companies do but when i was employed with the school district i didn't have maternity leave either and that was the reason because they thought was showing prejudice to women and not to men but huh that's interesting so uh that's a bummer though i mean yeah it is you have to save all of your uh vacation time you got to take some time off you do you have to save all your vacation time and that's usually how it's uh happened but uh yeah uh-huh what do you see uh changing in the future i think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies um run by females right and and top level and we'll probably i'm sorry right right upper management more women in upper management and probably uh we'll see more females in political roles maybe top level more governors and i think you know roles like that that'd be kind of nice well we've got in Texas we have a a female governor and we had a female mayor here in Dallas and she just her term just ended that's right that's right and uh so i think we're probably going to see more of that in the future yeah i think that's probably good a little more integration uh-huh and uh maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners and right you know i mean and that's fine with me but sometimes i mean i'm not a women's libber by any means but i do there are issues that you know as far as like equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff i i think right totally am for but i don't get into the um right the real women libber movement you know no i don't either i don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal yeah we just function differently right right and uh i'm not capable of lifting what uh a man can lift and you know that type of that type of thing but uh one of the big changes uh yeah right they're doing in Salt Lake is uh and they're probably i'm sure in Dallas since you're big places a lot more women are uh working right out of their home with their PC's or their lap computers or whatever yeah i've i've heard of that um i haven't really talked to anybody that's you know too involved with that but i mean i think that is a like the cottage industries i think that is is that what you're talking about women working out of their homes right yeah um i think it's wonderful right you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week and yeah course they're talking about uh that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and oh i know by the phone and all that banking and everything like that so uh it'd be kind of exciting in some ways to to see a little bit more of that and some ways it might be kind of scary right think anybody could do it but right anyway yeah i wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and right going an hour later and picking it up right but then you know there's the process of selection would you have to give them the brand and uh right right you know when you shop you usually compare the prices and would be nice though  i would say Arlington Texas now because i talked to one night to somebody in Arlington Virginia oh my yeah and well uh Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois oh do they have one yes they do oh i didn't know that well i learned something already yeah well let's see the three questions are what um how much time do you spend with your children very little because they're grown they're grown and gone oh what oh yeah well mine's are down at UT Austin in college and the other one's in high school so you do spend less time then because yeah because they don't want to know they almost don't want to know us they wanna be with their friends well how old are your kids are they married or what yeah uh yes i have uh two married two almost and then two almost married and the other two oh i'm not sure well two single two two uh uh for sure single oh boy you have a lot of kids you yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six oh that's kind of nice though you because i came with a split family and she had one you shouldn't be lonesome on a holiday huh well no there's so much of them are gone and they're doing their own things and well that's true and a lot of times they they've got you know uh on the holidays a lot they have to see their other parent i guess too yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes it's just spouse and me and and you know what i know right sometimes that's okay i know that's what my mother said one time because you know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time right for the holidays no that's true and if they force them to you know that's not good either yeah that becomes a drudgery and when you well do they all live in the area well let's see i've got of the six we've got four around here um-hum oh wow uh you know well we're talking like North Texas and then one is in Vermont uh Montpelier Montpelier Monteplier Montpelier Vermont and the other one's in Everett Washington um-hum golly how'd they end up so far away well that is that's the the the my little pair uh-huh and my second marriage um and uh those are the youngest ones yeah yeah well the second the the the the fourth and fifth child of the the of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that um-hum boy that those are a long way how'd and well they wanted to go uh JR my my my least son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh um-hum um-hum uh Vermont so yeah that's where they've gone to make their homes Vermont so they wanted to make their homes there huh my goodness are they are those two married no are they uh just working up there or going to school or what well uh let's see yeah i guess you'd say JR is working and going to school trying to go to school um-hum i wish to God he would go back oh they do eventually if they have if they're meant to i think yeah well i certainly hope so i mean i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at UT and i'm i'm going to UTA right now myself so it's never too late uh-huh well it's oh i agree it's never too late right especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about twenty percent older students and yeah and when you're saying older we're talking fifty up oh yeah i've seen some people that are really really quite up there you know they look like in their very late sixties and i say that's great why not you know uh-huh oh my uh-huh yes why not because that's a a lot of times well it's i i believe that uh we in that category and i'm not in that category quite yet but no but we are seasoned minds oh yeah you're really ready to learn finally finally i mean i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen it was a complete waste of money yes uh-huh yeah it was yeah settle down we know what we're wanting to to uh study and uh right right now we're we know our limitations right and uh and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and then the middle altogether no we don't go out drinking beer till three and then you try to go to class in the morning we're past yeah we're past that age at seven yeah yes we're we're smarter than that we know what we can do oh yack right um so let's see so mine and i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here um-hum and so the second question i forgot what the second question what was it what uh how what do the trends in families and do we approve of what other families do well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing but i have seen lately yes i am seeing that's right a change i was gonna say the same thing i'm seeing a change that whoops government can't do it schools are not able to and between a person's religion um-hum um-hum uh their their faith in their maker whether whether you know uh whether you're Christian or Jewish or whatever uh and the family right right those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal and of course or gonna have sauce on the bone huh Judeo-Christianity uh and the the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh um mission by the Lord to do this very thing so when another group of of uh people step in try to do it they're they're tromping on our territory so to speak so i firmly believe that uh um-hum oh  all right well i guess well which one have you got right now or well i got a couple of them i at the moment use an AST 286 and i got a leading edge and i got a American one and had a IBM one but my my just a couple what do you have um i've got an Omega and i've got a uh generic 380 or 486 machine yeah it's very very generic oh yeah what did you do put it together yeah and and uh upgraded it and put things in there and dibbled and dabbled and now now it's now it's a fast machine that's all i got to say for it hm well that's yeah yeah what do you use it for what do you use it for uh work uh i'm a contract programmer oh yeah what kind of programs do you um anything yeah okay i i mean like business programs or uh i've done business programming scientific you know scientific applications like you know petroleum science stuff and uh oh yeah uh-huh uh test equipment and i did the i i did one that was a demonstration of a touch touch screen for a company that sells uh touch screens it was kind of fun put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display and uh-huh huh and make it look like things like uh you know attack simulators and don holds well that's all sorts of little things you'd think you'd want to put your finger on the screen for well that sounds interesting matter of fact uh i guess you do uh you get a lot of graphics in there i imagine huh oh yeah definitely that's that's where the speed helps out uh yeah unfortunately the little portable PC that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz eighty eighty six it's like slow yep that'll that'll slow you up well i i do uh uh programming for CNC turret presses and hm um-hum uh cad cam system type things and uh really need a faster system uh i got a new line that i i sell metal fabricating equipment and cad cam systems and tooling et cetera and um-hum well i know a guy that upgrades uh for reasonable cost uh who is that uh his name is TQ or something like that and my notebook is somewhere around here see if i can make my telephone cord stretch far enough what i've tried to do is get this outfit to uh but he's uh up in hm give me one that's how i got my other ones by selling their product for them they not only give me a demonstrator but the hardware as well as the software um-hum oh that works and as they and as they go to the next one i just keep the that's why i have so many different levels of PCs around at the moment uh here it is ATS Computers ATS um-hum and where are they at uh do you know where uh Custer is okay he's oh yeah um uh south of Renner on on Custer okay and there's a little bitty mall that looks kind of like or strip kind of center in Richardson in Richardson there hm in Richardson um-hum i know where you mean there's a Mobil and all that kind of stuff uh on that one corner that's about Lookout there i think isn't it right it's it's it's just south of there it's a little place looks like a castle kind of yeah yeah you know little guy in there he he uh gives reasonable prices oh like i i traded my uh three eighty six for the four eighty six for about six hundred really well that's a good deal yeah it was pretty reasonable yeah but uh uh he and he does a good job and he says he he uh guarantees everything he has sells uh there's a lot you ever go over by Lucky Computer there um-hum yeah i used to when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys i'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems and um-hum haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so so i i don't know where those guys are at these days but i would assume uh they they're up there in that mall uh just below Campbell or that strip strip center yeah yeah yeah they're still doing business big business apparently yeah they i tell you those prices have just unbelievably come down um-hum well yeah i was amazed that i was able to get this four eighty six for six hundred even with a trade in you know it's like wow that works i'll go do that and boy that thing screams now yeah yeah i yeah i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed the three eighty six that wasn't alive for but maybe two years um-hum well i thought was funny that they kept pushing the 386 SX even though the the price difference is about ten dollars is that right that's it yeah it and when it comes on the manufacturing floor it's about ten bucks i'll be darned yeah huh well  okay do you do you have a home or are you in apartment okay so do you have to do a lot of garden work uh-huh i have a home not really we have a a small back yard and small front yard but um uh-huh um i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower's too heavy oh okay that's another story and um and uh i do the edging and stuff like that but um it doesn't take us that long because our our yard's so small but um i try and do as much you know flowering as i can and uh-huh um-hum that kind of stuff the seasonal things um-hum yeah uh-huh but um and well i think we have one of the nicest yards in the in the neighborhood well that's nice i wish i could say that ours is pretty small too but it it takes about an hour with the two of us working to you know do the bushes and and all of that sort of thing um the worst part is controlling the weeds yeah yeah oh yeah which i hate because we don't like to use a lot of the chemicals and because like we have a dog and and you know he's gonna be out in the yard and who knows what he eats out there but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway that's true uh hum what else i get to put out all the Christmas lights out there and all that sort of thing i don't no he does that no oh okay well if if they go up like one year we did the edge of the house all the way up on the roof and i i went up on the roof once and i'll never do it again uh-huh yes oh oh God i decided i was afraid yeah i don't blame so this year he got lazy so i said fine i'll put some on the bushes and that's about it that's all it it gets yeah huh but okay we don't have that many bushes to put them on um our our yards are very uh narrow and so we have some bushes but we don't have too many but we have a nice tree in the front and um-hum um-hum um-hum uh we have people that an association that comes and mows everybody's front yard and um they keep hitting hitting it the tree with the lawn mower you know every time you do that you oh wow oh no uh-huh it it um kind of kills the tree for a while and so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again yeah oh and we started mowing our own lawn because they were doing that and so anyways we have a nice full tree now and and we put our we usually fill it with lights and that kind of thing um-hum um-hum um-hum um-hum so and they would um they also edged and they would edge into into the shrubbery and oh gosh it was getting really bad so we hum oh but you still have to pay for it though even though they're not gonna do it yeah because it's an association fee oh is it real expensive yes it's like seventy a month oh okay oh my goodness yeah and it i don't like i i just get really upset every time i make that check out but um yeah well do do they do other things for y'all they take care of the um landscape because we live in a cul-de-sac and there's a island in the middle and so they care of that and there's a pool and they take care of the pool and and there's a pond they take care of the pond and the park area and that kind of thing and so you're um-hum um-hum um-hum basically paying oh and the sprinkler system that that our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system but the island does and um certain sharing areas have sprinkler systems and uh-huh um-hum and so that way if someone moves out the entire neighborhood is mowed and watered and that kind of thing you know so hm but you knew when you moved in you'd have to pay that didn't you well it it it went up since we pay and that's the bad thing i just hope it doesn't go up any more because we just can't afford it anymore i don't know what to do if you can't afford it oh yeah i don't know either that's interesting so um but they're that's what they do they take care of basically the front yards and unless you don't want them to do it and um-hum now do they do things like plant bushes and trees they only only in like in the common areas and then the island but they don't do it in your yard oh okay so there's like no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that right uh-huh yeah so we've added bushes and and shrubbery too um-hum yeah when we moved into our house i just hated the bushes they had and i i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back and put new ones out front but that was a lot of work took me a long time i know yeah yeah that's what we did when we first moved in too just rearranged some things um-hum yeah and then then we put in a sprinkler system and we won't go through that again i will pay someone to do it oh it took so long oh oh really oh because my husband was you know digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher you know there the machine that'll do it because he knew so many people that broke it through their water main or their gas main doing it oh yeah and i guess that costs you an absolute fortune oh that's true so gosh you did it manually huh oh yeah oh God by hand yeah yeah but it works great now that we've got it yeah it's nice i bet yeah that's a good investment there yeah well we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble and you know you have to keep the the area moist around the house or it makes it worse so we had an incentive there oh oh to do that  well what have you seen recently oh my goodness well we don't go to the movie much but we see quite a few on TV yeah um i asked you first because i couldn't think of which one i've seen well let me see uh i guess the last one we saw at the movie was probably Pretty Woman yeah i saw that uh-huh it was cute did you oh i thought it was too i thought it was a real good movie um yeah the last one that i saw i i was thinking about whenever the the voice was uh telling us what to think about i rented last weekend this movie called a The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie that was made in nineteen nineteen sixty nine starred Maggie Smith who's really one of my all time favorite actresses i don't know if you're if you're familiar familiar with her oh uh-huh oh i've uh but she's English and she won the Academy Award for it that year uh-huh oh and um i had just seen it but it was just a fluke that i happened to see it i was in college back then and i and and happened to see it and it and i remember thinking thinking at the time when i was watching it i was going gosh this is you know even that at that young i said it this is an Academy Award performance it has to be you you know and as it turned out she did win it that year yeah that's great i remember that movie and i remember that it was very good i don't remember if i saw it or not yeah but but i rented it uh last weekend and i can't i i don't know when i've enjoyed a movie um as much as i did that one it was just excellent so um uh-huh oh uh there's one that um oh let's see my son likes with Tom Cruise it's a an airplane movie uh Top Gun um-hum um-hum Top Gun yes i thought that was a good movie lots of rock them sock them action in that yeah yeah there's a lot of action but i thought it was an excellent movie uh-huh it was good and let's see do you like any of the old have you seen uh friend of mine that who is in Denver was telling me about uh all these old movies from the thirties and forties oh well now i love all those well she told me about one that uh and i said i said gosh i don't think i've seen any of that and she said well rent this one she told me it's called Now Voyager with Betty Davis great it was terrific uh-huh oh well that's good um i remember that movie i don't remember if i saw it i saw everything i could see when i was younger and i remember a lot of them and i love seeing them again uh-huh uh-huh but i don't think anything will ever top Gone with the Wind uh-huh well you know it was on television here in Houston oh about two weeks ago yeah we taped it uh-huh did you yeah it it it really is it's such a classic yeah it really is anything course with Clark Gable i like uh-huh and uh oh i don't know let's i like the older movies because they were just so much more classier than what you see today well they really were and i i don't know that it just seems that you know there was so much more thought that went in behind them and the the dialogue was good it wasn't uh uh i mean you know i'm i'll be honest with you it takes a fair amount to offend me and sometimes i go to these movies and they've got just this gratuitous uh uh uh-huh you know cursing in there just and and it seems like you know it and they somebody says well we need to have the you know x number of of dirty words in in order to make it appealing and and and oh yeah right um-hum i don't know it's i'm always impressed with a with a good movie that that can get by without it i saw tell you what i saw know and this that reminds me of it is City Slickers which was um was real cute uh-huh oh but anyway the thing that reminded me about it was real clean yeah well they could leave out a lot of that stuff and the movie would be just as good i agree i agree now um let's see i saw that Dances with Wolves it was good yes that was good wasn't it i didn't think it was just the end all and be all like the Academy thought the you know no i didn't think so and i told everybody that if i had made that movie i could have made it shorter because there wasn't uh-huh uh-huh any need to go into that much detail yeah you know show me one thing and i get the picture no right but it had a good story and uh and it was a little different but it was a little too gross for me yeah not over and over and over and over uh-huh well you know that's it my my mother i whenever she and my my dad went to see it and i asked them uh uh how they liked it and then my mother said well if you like a lot of gore and blood it's great and you know and i guess yeah right i'm partially immune to it but it didn't excuse me it didn't seem to be  well what kind of books do you like best well i alternate between uh Danielle Steele is one of my very favorites and uh then i try to go into one of the self improvement books um we we take books every once in a while in our Sunday school class and go through them um i love Scott Peck and his Road Less Traveled huh yeah i've heard of that one i don't think i've read it oh it is it is wonderful i i thoroughly enjoy that what do you read well uh i'm a Tom Clancy fan oh okay and i read i just finished a book on Novell Netware uh that's computer stuff i do a lot of computer reading and uh i'm just finishing another one up on uh statistical sampling oh yes so i do more work kind of related reading than uh just for enjoyment i i try to keep a book going all the time uh i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep so i probably get oh thirty to fifty pages a day read well that's pretty good and i just you know i don't feel like in in fact this morning i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book and i didn't wanna put it down oh i've had them like that before too but i like i like mysteries mysteries any particular writer uh yes i like uh um oh i'm drawing a blank uh he wrote the uh Bourne Ultimatum Ludwig Ludwig yes Ludwig yes and uh i like Jeffrey Archer what does he read write he is an English author who writes some mystery um well i guess they're they're a type of mystery they're usually some part he's a ex-lawyer so or he he's a lawyer who no longer practices but his are all have some part of the law uh enveloped in them so you kind of learn something as well as enjoy enjoy yourself right and then uh the new author that came out with uh oh the one that uh Harrison Ford starred in Raiders Raiders of the Lost Ark stuff no no it was the uh oh it's late i'm tired so i'm not thinking too well what what time is it there ten thirty uh-huh uh it's nine thirty here oh it's uh it was his first book it came it was on the top of the list um he was a DA uh Presumed Innocent uh yes oh i haven't seen the movie read the book but okay and then his he came out with the second one uh a sequel to it oh and both of those i've enjoyed real well but i i like that i love Danielle Steele and and you know if i wanna get a fantasy and get away from it all is she is she kind of racy no no she isn't at all her books uh just feel good you always cry oh really i mean it's it's always good for good tears uh one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is Fine Things hm F I N E things my my mother-in-law's a real fan of hers well it's it's one that you know it's it's always gonna make you have a good cry and you dow it's gonna turn out good and you're gonna be happy in the end oh well that's nice and i said you know i don't want anything too real anymore i have enough of that in my own life i want i want happy fantasy like yeah uh you mentioned Sunday school LaDonna uh do you are you a Bible fan too uh-huh uh i i do my share of it i i certainly can't say that i understand a lot of it oh yeah that's that's always a challenge so do you do my wife talks with other people  uh okay all right i'll start uh funding well i guess you could go first perhaps on this one i think that in light of the seriousness of it of the fact that that uh by what uh i think they said by the year two thousand there'll be at least five is it five thousand a year or more is that what it is statistically uh yeah will be dying from it and i know uh what is it uh over in Africa it's just already in horrendous uh right truly an epidemic yeah it really is so in light of that i think that that we're probably going to have to increase the funding for research i think that uh i don't know if they have it but it looks like to me that all the countries could go together and have like a joint AIDS research program i don't know if they already have one of those where everybody could put in their input um-hum um-hum do you know if that exists today in a cross country kind of collective i don't know i don't know i don't i don't hear about research that much except in the terms of what the United States is doing and the celebrities that show you know the benefits and things that they put on for AIDS research i do i did hear about uh uh-huh uh-huh Africa and um how rampant it is over there yes and i know uh in talking to i have a relative that works for uh state welfare in Oklahoma the AIDS children that are coming in with it yeah uh it i mean it it's it's tragic it's just absolutely horrible and it's you know it's not just homosexuals it's you know heterosexuals it's you know the drug users it's exactly innocent people that you know go in for blood transfusions so i mean it's starting to affect everyone do you think that the visibility um is part of what is keeping it in the limelight the fact that the funding sources are being discussed so so regularly um is because um of the nature of the disease the fact that it's such a terrible way to die and so on i think that probably partly is it i think that it is has received so much more publicity since we have had well-known actors athletes um-hum everything coming down with it i think that uh i do agree with someone when uh Magic Johnson announced uh there was a uh spokesman spokesperson for the gay community that came out and said that you know it would not be receiving this much publicity if it wasn't for someone like Magic Johnson and it would be you know very interesting to see it's true it's a different level of publicity um-hum that's right that's right and i think it it i think it makes people more aware that it hits other than just the gay community and uh sure but i do think that that in light of the fact that it's going to hit all of us i think what are they saying by the year two thousand i think it's one in three is supposed to have it you know it it because it it is it's spreading so rapidly um-hum i agree with you i do believe that there should be a greater amount of uh funding sources set aside for it but i i know that the visibility of it is part of what's causing it to get this attention now and i would hope that the emphasis would continue over the long term i mean i'm surprised to see the numbers of um people who for example who women who have breast cancer and have died are even greater than the number of people who who have died from AIDS oh i didn't realize that on on a regular basis that the statistics are higher and yet it's such a benign kind of a thing it seems like it's been with us for a long time and it's such a well it is i know that i i heard another conversation regarding AIDS the fact that that you know cancer is not receiving this and yet is is cancer growing at such a rapid rate that may be the other issue that it's it's it's reaching epidemic proportions and we have you know it it you know and i think that's what is scaring people is that it is reaching such epidemic proportions you know where um-hum is is cancer on the rising is it rising as rapidly um-hum you know as for instance AIDS you know uh it yes and i don't know that it may not be i don't i don't know either you know it's it's just uh and granted i i do think that because of the publicity and because of the people you know getting it and everything i think that that people are more aware of it than you know say if you know someone just dies with cancer which is it's a tragic way um-hum um-hum i mean you know it's tragic that it's that way um-hum um-hum i i look at the community resources that were dedicated to um those with cancer in terms of transitional living environments and um volunteer services and those sorts of things  okay you know what happens is i've tried i was out because of surgery last week so i tried calling a couple of eight o'clock calls and i got a person from Utah and a person from New York and a person from New Jersey so i thought sort of need her calling really early in the morning early in the morning and you got somebody from Dallas uh well i'm from Mesquite out of town so that's why that's why i've been making been making it a habit of calling in the morning um-hum but anyway uh the topic was the most important benefit of your job today besides salary and how satisfied are you and everything i'm sort of self-employed so uh i um-hum um-hum well i am too for the first time in my life um-hum really i'd be at a a little loss for words on this as far as i'm concerned most definitely uh most important benefit today would be hospitalization and of course retirement and things like that um-hum well i've worked for a large Fortune 500 company before and have had the luxury of uh benefits and um at a very small cost and uh then got out on my own through no fault of my own i was with Safeway and they left the country or left the um north part of the state uh-huh and uh i find myself in the insurance industry and i am finding i although i don't sell group insurance or major medical i sell supplemental health i'm finding that every place i go to talk to them about my product it's they're in such a dilemma about um the major medical group market right now it's just not very desirable um well that's very true i can understand that because i'm a just a small business person i run a my company has five people but uh they're all straight commission salesmen so they all provide their own um-hum insurance and it's been that way since nineteen seventy four and my office is just a one person office i have myself plus my secretary and she comes in at nine leaves at five and uh um-hum she's on her husband's insurance program and i just uh so you're fortunate in that manner yes well um i think some of the benefits that are being made available nowadays like the 401K to the employees yes um is beneficial i was not a participant or that was not available when i was employed but uh i did participate in a stock program and uh oh that's great and that really worked out well for me when i had been with the company for thirteen years and now have a a you know a small retirement set aside which is allows me to go on commission sales and um and do it you know comfortably oh that's neat are you married uh no i'm not okay well i'm married and my wife's a school teacher so i'm on her they have pretty good insurance so i they she carries me on her insurance program which works out real well they really do what uh school district is she in she's in the Plano School District in Plano um-hum and it's not cheap it's like all insurance insurance just keeps on going up more and more every day and course the uh the prices they're charging today and because of the problems they have exactly and the deductibles are going up and that oh deductibles are high um-hum that's one of the reasons my um the what my product is just getting more and more popular because it's a catastrophic cancer insurance intensive care and a daily hospital indemnity and so those kinds of things not only help a person um cover um their deductibles it helps you know pay the rent and or the mortgage and they and the car payments when uh that person has to be off with something like cancer or heart attack oh you bet supplemental anything is important today i'll tell you whether exactly and i'm i real feel real fortunate that i've landed in a with a really good company in a good position well that's great and they're really nice too one of the benefits of that company is that they provide me with some stock um they give it to me uh three point five percent of what i sell and um uh annualized premium and so this is really going to add up through the years i've been doing this over a year and have already accumulated quite a bit well that's super so we're just uh i carry my own Keogh Plan as far as benefits and i've been doing that since nineteen seventy four or seventy five or whatever and um-hum that's more or less my wife's and my retirement i'm fifty years old my wife is forty nine and she didn't start teaching till she was forty so um-hum um-hum we raised our kids first and she went back and got her degree and started teaching so it looks like we're gonna retire in a couple of years and she'll uh she'll qualify for a little something after ten years of teaching but not a whole lot but it'll be um-hum um-hum certainly be useful and needed right what kind of business are you in i'm in the sporting goods business i'm a own a manufacturer's rep firm and uh we we represent eighteen different hunting and shooting type companies and that's all i've done since i see um-hum i graduated school years ago sold a sold is that right well it's the first time i've been in sales in my life uh-huh really oh it's neat isn't it i love it i love it i should've been there a long time ago oh yes  okay Miss Nancy we should be in business now did you hear the questions that the lady uh brought up good yes such as how much time well i'll ask how much time do you spend with your children and how many do you have we have two children they're both grown and married and with we have uh our daughter has three sons so we see them at least once a week and we see our son and his wife um about every other week and uh we babysit quite frequently so we're a fairly close-knit family we're together a lot on special days and uh and of course with the holidays and everything um-hum well you're very fortunate uh my my uh i have two girls and a son and my oldest daughter lives in Amsterdam Holland uh-huh ooh she's her husband builds pianos so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them as much as we'd like to because we've we one thing we do have together is we're both musicians i play in several symphony orchestras and she is uh oh yes uh-huh a a concert uh harpsichordist and travels around good bit in Europe oh uh-huh and uh her husband builds forte pianos which are harpsichord sized pianos pianos uh-huh and uh that's why they're over there and then i have a a son who lives in um Warrington Pennsylvania um-hum and i get to see him maybe once every three months so i really we've lost you know i'd like to have an everyday contact with children uh as as well as you do for that matter and my youngest my youngest daughter lives in New Jersey and so they oh you don't get to see any of yours very often i don't hardly get to see any of them she works in these um Trump type casinos she and her husband both do they work uh they're really both um yes uh-huh play people who play on stage um-hum and uh they're running lights right now and audio and that thing for plays and things that go on but anyhow uh what what do you what activities do you do with your children when you are together um-hum oh most the time well right now it's football season and our daughter is a big Cowboy fan as is our husband so my husband so yeah she watches that and i play with the grandchildren i enjoy the grandchildren but now like last weekend um there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas and it ends uh in January so she and and the three boys and my husband and i went over into Fort Worth to see the space exhibit and this Sunday uh-huh the Soviet space exhibit my goodness i would am surprised they would bring anything over here uh-huh yeah it's oh it's been here for quite some uh some time i think it came here in either September or October huh-uh and it's very interesting very interesting and it's been very well done uh and this uh next Sunday they're coming over after the Cowboy game and uh uh we're going to go take the boys to see Christmas lights and go to a Santa's village i'll bet why um-hum and uh then when our son's over we have a pool and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends and we have cookouts on Sunday uh and uh well that sounds like you have really wonderful activities that keep you together yeah we we do a lot with with our kids and we we always have we've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger uh we're very family oriented we um well that's wonderful we like being with our kids and the kids seem to enjoy being with us and their friends enjoy being with us so which that keeps us very very young with all these young people passing in and out and eating and seems like i've um-hum the only problem is it keep you pretty busy keeping everything going doesn't it well it does i'm worried about Christmas Christmas Eve they all pass through and then they all end up spending the night Christmas Eve night so that we open our presents on Christmas day and they go out to the other you know the in-laws in between some of this but they're all um-hum beautiful um-hum with us and uh then have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other in-laws and in things so we see a lot of them but we enjoy Christmas Eve night because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock and we open presents about five o'clock Christmas morning and you know and uh then um-hum i go to the kitchen and cook and my sister and and her husband are coming down so there's gonna be eleven of us that's great there was a question the question now to ask is it difficult to find time and you seem to be making out all right for Christmas yeah sometimes i'm a little exhausted but well tell me what what do you think of uh of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth oh i think i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families i think parents are definitely uh spending more and more time i don't think they're leaving them with babysitters uh you know um-hum i think i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there for about uh i don't know eight or nine years yes um-hum seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal parents kind of went and did their thing kids did their thing and uh well that's no that's exactly what i was gonna say if of of because i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in detail i know more about them and watch their growth yes um-hum and how they improve and and learn much more so than my own kids when when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted and you go ahead and do your thing and holler at  okay go ahead what are you gonna fix for Christmas dinner you know i i think the simpler the better i think so too yes too often we spend all day cooking and uh it's like Erma Bombeck's cartoon said it you spend eighteen hours fixing your dinner and it takes twelve minutes to eat it that's right less than twelve minutes well we're gonna fix a turkey and a ham we're gonna have about fifteen people for dinner and we're gonna have all the fixings with that the dressing and also you know everything with the ham so we're gonna have a real nice dinner well the i think that sounds like fun the thing that i think that's missing at the uh little Christmas parties though is uh fruits you fix you put out grapes people eat those up first and yes you put out strawberries they grab for those first right and we kind of get uh overdosed on the sweets don't we i think it right i think that's what the problem may maybe that's i think that way because i can't have those sweets so well they usually don't do a whole lot good for us and uh that's right uh i'm been trying to think of something uh nifty to make for neighbors and uh for neighbors i used to just bake cakes and there's there you go more sweet stuff yes uh right i thought people kind of get so overloaded and most people are trying to lose weight anyway that's right and uh so it's kind of hard to get away from that isn't it hard to kind of deviate a little bit uh yeah yeah so have you got any good recipes that don't have uh well i i do but they're at home i don't have i'm at work right now and i don't have them with me yes that's true that's right i have some sugarless recipes that's right are you diabetic or no i'm hypoglycemic okay so i have um recipes to make cookies without sugar we put uh fresh applesauce you know fresh fruit in it applesauce and raisins and things like that in it no you probably that's the kind of direction you wanna go with food anyway that's right and uh nowadays food it's uh almost everybody eats out of these boxes don't they the TV dinners or the they what i think food it's really changing to not spending so much time everybody's such in a hurry uh you yeah they don't wanna spend time cooking and baking and well and i don't think they have the time as much maybe well when you buy those prepared foods in a store like that they're all they either have too much salt in it in them or too much sugar in them oh yes i'm uh i just haven't you know acquired a taste for them have you no because they're too salty most of those yes dinners like that most of them are uh-huh in fact turkey uh would be my choice of meal anytime i i'm a turkey lover and oh yes i could eat turkey mine too unfortunately it's not the easiest uh or it takes a while to prepare it that's right but uh it's not necessarily hard it just you got to plan on five or six hours to cook the thing so well that's why people usually have them on holidays because you're usually home visiting and you're home and you've got the time to cook them and it doesn't it smell good in the oven out as it's cooking i said doesn't it smell good yeah in the it just sets the baking in the oven the mood i don't know what uh Thanksgiving or Christmas would be without especially Thanksgiving without the turkey that's right wouldn't quite taste right would it huh-uh it wouldn't be Thanksgiving dinner without the turkey well even going out to eat we had discussed going out to eat and uh i don't even care at your best restaurant it's just not the same on a holiday to yeah when i go out to eat on Thanksgiving i still have a turkey dinner yes yes you'd still have to choose that wouldn't you uh-huh i've gone out on Thanksgiving like that and had other foods and then i'd leave and i'd say well that doesn't it doesn't seem like it's Thanksgiving to me no it seems like another day it's because you didn't we didn't have any turkey you right right you kind of get used to that um well i think i hope that the trend is to change to more health conscious foods and not have so many additives and uh preservatives and you know you it's hard to even to get a cold cereal that you don't feel like it's sugar that's right that's right well and uh the women just don't have time to cook anymore like they used to because most of them work no well and i don't mind cooking it's just that you know after you think of the hours it takes you if you get very elaborate sometimes it doesn't seem very rewarding to cook that many hours and then you usually have a a mess  okay where does she live uh on Rutherford Rutherford i don't know that it's um corner of New York uh just um-hum west of Mayfield it's oh oh south and okay yeah i know where you i know the area right that's kind of on the other side of town so our kids probably never went to school together or anything uh oh okay oh they're they're little ones oh well i've got one in college by now uh oh let's see we're on government whether we think it's honest or can be right right is it possible to have an honest government i'm beginning to think it's not what about you i i don't think under the way the system is right now it is i don't either i i think uh even if people have good intentions and i think crime uh power corrupts or something or to a certain extent you know and ultimate power ultimately returns corrupts yeah it seems like um maybe more of them come in with good intentions but it's just so enticing and all the corners being cut and the special deals available because they're in on the know you know i don't know if there's enough money that you could pay them just you know love them x amount of money to keep them honest i just i just don't uh right i mean you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions you know what i mean little bit little bitty positions and in your own home town and they'll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power so maybe it's just man's inner nature right we had uh here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on on our county commissioners and there were several counties uh including the one i was in that lost everyone of their county commissioners and um-hum oh my word i mean it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail oh wow what were they doing taking some oh no oh gosh yeah right oh they were taking kickbacks yeah just a little here and a little there and major amount here and major amount there right oh but i think there was something like you know thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail um we haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records other words they'd go out and have a big lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained but that person wasn't even anywhere near there you know sometimes they weren't even in the same city one of them had had cancer and died and i mean that was our biggest scandal for the last few years i think uh that that's small scale i don't know you know i really don't know what could be done i don't i don't either uh to make it totally honest uh i think there's always there's always gonna be some way somebody can cut a corner uh however uh the things that have gone on gone on in the last couple of years we can't afford too many of those you know the the HUD mess and the S and L we can almost not afford such terrible corruption that's right the cover-ups and right right i think that uh Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that but uh i uh i don't know i just uh i'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests i think that's what upsets me worse than that they're getting a little you know uh on the side that right um-hum um-hum that it seems that when they get up there it's it's what if i vote your way what it'll do for me rather than this is the way my constituents want it that's right but they stay there um-hum right and this'd be for the best for the nation overall you're right it's just a i don't know i guess that's where they stay in uh and they try to stay in office but then they always please the money people too they need money so much because they're constantly having to run run for office again and run maybe and then you think if well if it was longer terms then they would never have try to please the people at home um-hum that's true boy i don't know it is a big problem but i think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now don't you i don't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government i know it's really terrible i mean there was a time i mean where i remember when i was real young i just loved Harry Truman i thought he was great oh you know i had some some of them seemed like kind of uh heroic people well i wonder if they really were or if we just really didn't know  well what magazines do you subscribe to Lori well we have probably too many we've got not enough to keep up i mean too many to keep up with we get uh Forbes Fortune Newsweek yeah Southern Living Texas Highways and National Geographic i think i think i've got them all oh gosh yeah uh-huh well i i take um right now i've kind of a whittled mine down i just take Vanity Fair and uh Harper's and uh Houston City magazine uh-huh uh-huh but you know how i used to subscribe to Texas Highways that's one of the best magazines for the money going right i mean it's such a bargain what what i mean what is it like twelve dollars a year it is something like that yeah and then the photography's beautiful it is yeah it's matter that's i thought about it not too long ago that uh i had seen an issue and i thought gosh i ought to give my parents that for Christmas but i of course now it's Christmas i haven't done it so maybe next year yeah but i know i had i had uh found myself about i don't know two years ago in the in a situation where i i literally had more magazines coming in than i could read and i thought this is crazy so i right you know it's not so bad if they're monthly publications but like Newsweek which i really enjoy um comes out every week and so it's really hard to keep up with uh-huh yeah well i i took Time for i guess ten years uh-huh and i enjoyed it and it and i it you know it has just you know a wealth of information i mean it's therefore similar to Newsweek but whenever i got to the point that i just i just finally said this is just insane because i had so many magazines i let them all lapse yeah and then once they were all gone and of course that took a while i didn't realize how much i had paid up on some of them uh-huh and uh then i decided well i you know Vanity Fair offered me a special thing to come back at a reduced rate you know uh-huh and then Harper's did and so i you know little by little i've i've you know subscribed to a few more again but uh i take the newspaper everyday right uh-huh so i've got plenty of reading material yeah well we get the newspaper on the weekends and that seems to be enough yeah yeah yeah because we'll just turn on the news otherwise and see see what the latest is well you sound though kind of like me though but i mean it's i'm i have always plenty of reading material around my house uh-huh and when i go to visit my brother and sister-in-law in Austin it drives me crazy because i i always have to be sure and put something in my suitcase to read because honestly i wonder these people don't ever read oh is that right yeah i mean their house just a you know it's just it's it's appalling to me they have nothing to read well maybe that's what you ought to get them for Christmas yeah really well uh well actually i think one year uh several years ago i did give them a a subscription to Time and they never said a word about it you know and so i thought well maybe they weren't uh-huh oh really i'd they're not into that maybe they weren't into it you know that's fine but it's just it's so different than yeah you know i just i require reading material that's all that is to it right right yeah um you know one thing i hate i don't know if this is really on the subject but when they call you the different places call you to sign up uh-huh at this you know and they try to give you this big bargain and and you're like no we already subscribe to enough magazines at the time and uh-huh so yeah well i um you know i had as a matter of fact the the Vanity Fair whenever i let it lapse uh-huh they had sent me all these you know final notice things and i just you know didn't send them back in um-hum and so finally once i did decide to subscribe again i sent in a a thing that said hey you know i mean it was whatever the the uh subscription rate was i think like fifteen dollars uh-huh uh-huh and about a month later i got a thing in the mail saying well hey as a former subscriber you can now get it for twelve and they had a one eight hundred number i called up and i said hey i want three bucks back oh right so they extended they said they were gonna extend my subscription for three months but they're pretty competitive uh-huh yeah yeah but um i find at times i have numerous magazines piled up and i'll just sit down you know one weekend or something and try to catch up on them yeah but i mean i you know i enjoy it i guess you know um as far as comparing that to other media it's so much easier to listen to either the radio or to watch TV to listen i mean to know what's going on rather than to read an article oh it is it is and it just but at the same time you can you can get information i mean there there in a magazine the variety and you can get different types of information and and you know television is is geared so much to right right the average Joe Blow and quite frankly i mean there there are items of interest to me that you'll never find on television exactly yeah that's true the other thing is um some magazines  okay what do you think about uh this health insurance business well i watched something on TV a couple of months ago by uh General ex uh Surgeon General Koop um-hum and he talked about Canada's system and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that but the expensive stuff heart uh operations and things they have a managed scarcity and they said that in Canada there were as many heart uh trauma centers as there is in San Francisco so in one city of in America there's as many uh hospitals that are equipped to do hospital uh heart operations as in the entire area of Canada and that's kind of spooky well i uh i understand what you're saying and there's probably some truth to that i think that uh generally i don't welcome added government responsibilities however when a anybody can't police their own profession it eventually leads to that and i think the costs and the uh the way the medical profession has every year i uh being in my own business uh in the last six years every year there's been at least minimum twenty five percent increase in health insurance costs and i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance as as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter uh uh-huh i think they're asking for it i i think the medical profession is just just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over and uh do you think that it's just the medical guys what about you know you know how expensive new equipment and technology is that's where i think most of the cost is coming well i i think a lot of it is uh i i don't disagree totally with that but uh my wife this last summer uh when we were on vacation tore up her knee and uh uh it it was ligaments ligaments uh in her knee as it turned out uh she came back that uh we were out at Cape Hatteras when this happened and uh she got home uh-huh and the leading orthopedic man who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come i mean he knows knee problems okay i mean if anyone does this guy knows it um-hum well she goes in and he says well i think this is what it is but uh you better go to the hospital and have one of these MRI things thousand dollars for this uh oh Magnetic uh Resonance uh Imaging type thing and my wife said well uh do i need that and he he says well uh you know it it'll help me diagnose this i mean uh you know i i suggest you go have this thing insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital oh great now a thousand uh uh dollars for thirty five minutes i mean doctors routinely send people in for anything now for years they didn't have this and they solved these problems and you know i said to her well look you know if you feel you got to go go but i i think a thousand dollars these guys i don't know what it is but there's no doubt they get kickbacks to fill these machines up night and day in and even if they cost a hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars at uh roughly a thousand dollars every half hour uh that's ridiculous i i don't care what anyone says those you know the costs are not it's a picture it shouldn't cost more than thirty five bucks for something like that you know reasonableness but they aren't reasonable fifty a hundred dollars they don't have to pay them back in three months time you you know you know yeah i'll have to agree with you there but there's another problem and that's the how litigious our society is if the doctor makes a mistake he can be sure that he's gonna to be hauled into court well i think that should be that's that's a another problem but that's part of our legalese problem and that the government eventually will address too just you know because it's out of control i i agree with you you know uh i was on a jury or i i didn't make the jury but there was a deal where a doctor was gonna be sued for malpractice on the death of an infant uh-huh like it was three days after it was born and he was the one that delivered it and they got four attorneys one guy out of Houston he introduced himsnelf as snake so-and-so he says well anyone have trouble awarding five million dollars and i says yeah i got problems with that i mean you know five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back you know i mean as sorrowful as it is uh you know if the doctor is wrong you know it he should be pulled from his license but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it you know it it it it doesn't make logical sense to me but uh no it doesn't uh that's  well um i kind of like the 49ers San Francisco right how about you be i'm a i'm a a die hard Dallas fan oh great i was born and raised here so i i have to back my team well yes i guess that that's understandable um why are you a 49ers fan well they have a couple players they have had and they do now that that um played here in Utah at BYU before they went down there um Steve Young was from BYU and uh Jim McMahon was he's not he's not one of my favorite players personality or otherwise but he did play here so that you know provides a little bit of interest um how about you what are who are some of your favorite players well there's a lot of them there's uh Michael Irwin that's uh making making a real real good name for himself this year uh-huh oh Troy Aikman uh-huh i don't know if you ever heard of him no i haven't well do you watch football well not too much i i follow mostly you know the college the college ones around here rather than the the professional not too much oh really right so you know you'll well who do you think's going to go far this year i don't know it's it's it's pretty it's pretty tough i'm i'm i don't follow the other divisions that that much it's i have a hard enough time just keeping up with Dallas and um-hum right the uh conference they're in right now uh-huh but i think Dallas will do pretty good i don't i don't know if they'll go all the way oh good uh-huh they're probably they they they may be another year away from going all the way oh but they'll they'll be in the play-offs and i think they'll do real good well good what do you think about how much the football players make that's a professional football players well uh that's i wouldn't mind wouldn't mind getting some of their salaries all right do you do you think they they should be paid that much yeah do you i think they earn it i think they earn it i mean i i mean i you'd have to pay me that much to get out there on the field to uh you think you know get the crap knocked out of me so uh-huh yeah well what about um yeah i guess the risk of injury that they go through i mean they get injured it's pretty much for life in that that kind of a thing do you play football do you i did i i just i just coach coach my son right now so oh i that's what i was would do you let your sons play yeah i do i mean i i let them do whatever they want to do i don't i don't hold them back i mean if they want to try it and uh do it that's fine if they don't want to do it that's fine i mean i i leave them leave it up to them as dangerous as it is uh-huh uh-huh have oh that's good because i don't want to hold them back from trying anything i mean they may be may be good at it uh-huh that's right they might be they might be making one of those salaries one of these days huh okay well um that's right let's see what else do you have any other teams that you follow at all besides Dallas or no not really not really that keeps you keeps you going yeah that keeps me busy enough right there do you think San how do you think San how's San Francisco doing this year do you well oh they're doing so-so they they uh their main quarterback was hurt and so um Steve Young's been uh you know in there taking his place but i think i think the main one's getting better so he you know they can get back in the is McMahon the head quarterback lead quarterback um isn't he playing for San Francisco yeah he is i think he is yeah he is and then um Steve Young was and and he hurt his knee McMahon hurt his knee and so the first couple of games yeah Steve Young went in for him yeah i thought i but i think he's back in there now yeah i thought at first Steve Young started out as a lead quarterback and then he got himself hurt and McMahon came in in one of the games and uh ended up just uh winning the game coming from behind um-hum i don't and they just let him keep starting because he was doing so good and kept winning well he yeah so he was better because i think he was here at the first of the season and then yeah that that probably happened so do you watch it Monday nights is that what you do on Monday nights is watch the football games uh sometimes it depends yeah it depends on what it what all's going on sometimes i sometimes i get a chance to sometimes i don't sometimes and who uh-huh oh so well when you coached your son's team did you enjoy that yeah enjoyed it a lot i mean this this is my first first year as a coach oh that's great uh-huh his first year of playing my first year as a coach so it was a it was a learning experience on both ends oh boy i'll say yeah how old how old do they let them play uh one that's he's just getting ready to turn ten oh another one's getting ready to turn six and one that's three so oh are they all boys all boys oh yeah you probably have a few years of football ahead of you okay well is there any other comments you wanted to make or yeah i think so not that i can think of okay all right well thank you thanks i enjoyed talking with you um-hum bye bye-bye  okay well do you exercise regularly there is well i am a school teacher and uh there uh uh girl that went through our school district i teach in Highland Park who uh uh-huh uh-huh who uh does aerobics at uh the YMCA and i say Y them YWCA turn that off please i am recording um-hum my husband just turned on something noisy anyway uh she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly and for an hour and we do it twice a week hm um-hum oh that's good and uh we do uh aerobics for cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching and toning and cool down uh-huh um-hum for another thirty minutes so it is an hour and then my husband and i take uh two mile walks uh as often as possible and uh not on the nights that i do aerobics but if if he wants to he jogs but i uh um-hum i we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and come back to the house uh-huh and so we we take it seriously we enjoy doing it i enjoy my group at school it's a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than it is to do it by yourself well that's good yeah yeah uh-huh well i use to exercise regularly and i haven't lately i have goofed off i guess um i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work but um oh oh oh um-hum i guess my job change my husband's job change and it's just not easy to get up early in the morning any more so um oh i understand that i've never been able to do it before no well the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day i just wanna go home and not do anything so yeah um-hum well i am too i just make myself i get up at five thirty and i am at school at seven thirty and school isn't over until uh four well um-hum and our class but it's in the building that is the big difference because oh there are other people around said uh you'd better hurry go get dressed you know there is motivation around there and then uh we can we can change right there in the building i don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere uh-huh yeah and i just go and we all exercise and until then you know i have belonged to exercise clubs and oh i've gone to uh oh like um oh these gyms you know that that like in Plano or Richardson or and uh where they offer the um-hum uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics and i've done that before but it always had to be late at night uh-huh uh-huh yeah after i've got home and after dinner and you are just kind of going ugh and i have tried it immediately after school like try to get some place and exercise from five to six but then by the time you get home and you fix dinner you are eating so late that's right that's right that's difficult really is it is it's really hard with our life style when you work um um-hum yeah i know well i know some people go during lunch but you know by the time i i get over the gym and and go to my class and shower and get back to work it's probably two hours or more and that's just too long so um-hum i have twenty five minutes for lunch yeah yeah that doesn't really do it does it yeah that's out for me no i don't think so but uh and they're nice because if we are running late it usually uh if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us you know because they know we are in the building and coming um-hum yeah well that good whereas and uh another place you are paying a lot more money and uh it it they're gonna to start whether you are there or not i mean you know that's right that's right so this has worked out real nicely in fact she charges us two dollars a session well that's not much hum-um so it's it's we like pay her for six weeks at a time because that is like a unit in uh uh school uh you know report card period and so it is like twenty four dollars every six weeks uh-huh uh-huh oh that's not bad hum-um it beats memberships at some of these clubs that's for sure they are real expensive you're not kidding i know we belonged um for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year uh-huh i mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus a month for our family membership and at first we used it and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth oh gosh yeah and they offered lots of things but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to so we decided to forget that that was just a waste of our our money yeah uh-huh yeah yeah well we have one through work and its its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which isn't bad oh no hum-um but i uh i don't know i still just don't don't end up going because there isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something um-hum but i need to do something if only walk the dog or something i need to start doing that um-hum it does make you feel better and the hard thing is getting going yeah that's right that's right and if you have somebody who will do it with you like for a long time my husband didn't want to walk because he wants to run uh jog uh-huh but he decided that uh maybe you know uh if i was you know would be willing to walk  well i need to find out from you how the last remodeling project you undertook and if it was successful and you you were pleased with what happened well you've been doing any remodeling lately the only remodeling we do is we put uh new uh we put up molding and wallpaper and we put it up in Chad's room and in the uh uh-huh front room all right did you like the results but i let the yeah i don't do the actual uh uh putting it i don't actually cut them the molding i mean we have a guy come in and do that and we do the painting and the sanding and then i built some shelves in the basement last week so i i guess that qualifies uh-huh all right yes it does what kind of molding is this uh molding crown molding and then some uh chair molding but uh oh uh-huh well that's a lot of fun we i guess maybe we will have to do some new projects when the baby comes oh yeah decorate a nursery or something huh yeah well you know we got the TV in this room that's probably have to be converted to a bedroom so oh okay yes get some uh get an extra room there for the new baby well you you haven't had to do any of that have you what's that any remodeling really no uh we've done uh some painting and put up some wallpaper in uh the boys' room uh-huh we needed to to paint because the paint was uh getting molten dingy or or grain plus there was a lot of markings on the on the paint that well on top of the bunk beds the boys got up there and uh started drawing on the ceiling and that was kind of hard to get off so we decided rather than uh uh wash it all off and clean it up we decided to paint over it and uh-huh the walls were were textured and there was a lot of holes from the previous owners and so we patched them all up and painted and and put border and wallpaper along the top and it looks really nice now and we we're quite pleased with it and and uh um-hum it uh looks pretty good there's a lot of other things that Cheryl would like me to do but yeah it's just finding the time yeah i guess we'll eventually get around to finishing the basement someday i don't know when well good good uh i think i might uh paint the uh cement you can there's supposedly kind of a cement paint you can get that uh will make it just a little nicer even you know before we finish it uh-huh well good you uh you put on a deck deck there recently too haven't you or that's been a couple of years well parts of the cement cement had a patio i painted the uh our porch uh-huh that was kind of a job had eighty eight spindles to sand and take all the paint off borrowed an air gun from Laura's brother in law and it uh yeah i imagine it would be wow painted it with yeah and that worked nice it's just one of those Wagner ones you know they well good yeah we have one they work pretty well really they're noisy yes i yeah they are they they make a lot of noise but they're good yeah we haven't used ours yet we'd like to use ours you haven't used it at all no i haven't oh so you don't you don't know how uh wait the only thing you've got to worry about is getting the paint the right viscosity yeah so it doesn't jam up you've used one before though it sounds like yes i have yeah it was my dad's and i i used it with him um-hum was able to paint some things and uh and he said he didn't need it anymore and he he gave it to us and we haven't had a chance to or need to paint anything down here yet i i'm kind of leery about using it inside oh yeah um because it does put a lot of particles and mist in the air that i didn't want to get all over the carpet or yeah yeah it puts out a lot and i mean i even ordered us that one when we did that porch yeah uh-huh i mean there was had the i had my watch and it was all over my shoes and uh the shrubs all turned white down there it it snowed huh that's about the only snow we can get down here in Texas if it if it were a white paint you probably used a a uh redwood color or a stain didn't you yeah it was just it was white oh it was yeah because the porch the porch spindles are white yeah that's right that's right and uh it was a latex we had a hard time getting it thin enough because latex is kind of rubbery to begin with a little thicker than most but it ended up working fine plus i was the weather you know i did it in uh oh yes um-hum oh good well the winter started to to cool down i think it must have been October when i finished um-hum yeah i remember it was a conference weekend i think when i finished well the the weather i understand was pretty good at that time yeah it was it was not bad but yeah the weather weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but is it yeah yeah it's uh we would like to like to do a little bit more we'll probably do some we were working recently out on our spa hum-um and uh and hot tub trying to it was really overgrown with a lot of yeah i guess uh what is it honeysuckle uh  okay you think you're getting your money's worth uh never i uh the only thing i'm i'm thankful of is that we don't have to pay any income tax here in in Texas well that's probably the next year's agenda yeah boy i tell you what i sure hope they don't pass something like that oh yeah they're finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i i think one way or the other we're gonna pay for the bureaucracy i guess and uh it's one area that's uh really i i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i i i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now well i i tell you um i remember every time it seems like we turned around they're adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline that's right that's right and actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline don't don't bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax yep that's right and every time you go to buy anything now uh even though you know they they tax food that's the one that really kind of bothers me well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is it's an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which allegedly allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards but uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they aren't going to be paying taxes on you know and uh that's the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i don't think it is anymore not in Texas anyway oh i got you because people that uh don't make very much money wind up spending it all that's right that's right and whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on that's right that's right and that's the unfairness of the thing but uh i think taxes generally are unfair what what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thousand or thirty thousand dollars well you know like other things if they don't affect you you don't worry about them too much i i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesn't i i think uh uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh oh sure i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh that's their prerogative you know i i i don't have a whole lot of sympathy on that you you maybe you buy that you know and i don't mean to be knocking uh no uh no i haven't but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax uh on top of it and there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know more well it it's just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know it's a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes yeah and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards right right now i don't know if that's true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know any any kind of interest that you're paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases sure so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they don't you know to a degree well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know they quit buying anything well what what about the taxes on cigarettes  well what what what do you feel do you feel that that our government uh is it possible to have an honest government or do we have an honest um well i feel that for i feel there's a lot of shenanigans going on i feel there's a lot of crookedness in it but i do feel that for the most part um our government is you know trying trying to make things work the best they can um um-hum how about you well uh i'm i'm i'm rather young i'm only twenty two and so uh my knowledge is based you know mostly on what i read you know in history um-hum uh-huh right but i do think based on what i read uh what i've read through uh about about our history of our government i think things are getting better oh uh-huh uh in the in the last maybe ten or fifteen years where Americans are becoming a little more aware and uh are forcing our government to be uh on top of integrity you know as an order uh-huh right right i agree but the people are demanding that that those that aren't you know that aren't either morally or or politically or going to do a good job that they're they're trying to get them out of it or at least they're taking a stand uh-huh yeah yeah against it so um i know a lot of the well in our community you know the government the leaders here um-hum i feel like they're all all real good people that are trying their best to to provide a service to the community and right when you think that most of the most of the politicians i'm i'm not really sure what the pay scales are and and how that that works but um i don't agree with some of the ways that they they earn extra money on the side you know i feel that uh-huh yeah that that that needs to be changed and and they should have more accounting on the different ways that they they earn their money have you ever ran for a public office probably not yeah probably not being twenty two not yet um my husband ran one time here in uh uh-huh have i no not yet huh-uh our little community and he ran you know for the town board and uh-huh and we felt like it was a a real good experience i think that um you know when people are wanting to get involved to to to make changes for the better in the community that it's that's it's a good thing so right does it worry you that um say someone like David Duke got such such publicity during uh during his campaign and that and that now he's running for uh thinking of running for president does that worry you at all yeah yeah that does worry me especially when with his background you know and the people have already voted him down i i don't understand really uh-huh um-hum yeah yeah really his reasons for doing that i don't uh i i don't either i don't know what he's i hope he doesn't know something we or i hope yeah hope he doesn't know something we don't really that's right yeah i was i'm interested in um our state is looking for a new governor and we have had oh i think the number is seven already that are running for it and this is not until next year that have put you know their hat in in in the ring to run and um-hum wow and i was surprised by that because it had seemed to me like there was almost getting to be that it was hard to get people to run because of the reason that you know they dredge up every single thing in your past oh yeah i mean and not very many people want to lay their their whole life on the line like that and say hey i you know i've never made any mistakes and uh-huh i think that would be a little bit frightening to uh-huh to be put in the public eye like that myself but we've had it here in the state a lot of people that are going to run for for governor and it seems like there's a lot of people that are starting to talk about running for president again uh-huh you know when when Bush is when he's finished so yeah um what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat well uh do you think the parties are a good thing or do you think they need to be done away with or i'm kind of disappointed that that uh the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because if if if you belong to any other party uh you know any other platform i should say uh you you're not represented um-hum um-hum um-hum i i don't i don't belong to any particular uh platform and and i don't think i ever will but um-hum i'm afraid that um i think his name was Anderson was the the gentleman who ran for uh on an independent ticket against Reagan and oh yes uh-huh uh Carter um i was real disappointed that uh uh that he didn't he didn't have a chance uh because he didn't have a platform behind him uh uh you know a group and yes uh-huh i think that's a little bit disconcerting you know where right it is where uh where we really really Americans don't have a voice unless they participate within one one of the two systems uh-huh and especially where if if you don't completely agree with their platform if there's i mean there's not a lot of choice like you say and you have to have the financial support or there's just no hope and um-hum um-hum um i know that one of the judges  so Utah yes that that's that's the state that got was famous when they executed somebody Gary Gilmore by firing squad as i recall Gary Gilmore yeah that's right and we still have a death penalty um-hum some a gentleman uh that was one of the hi-fi murderers just had his conviction overturned well appealed again i guess we have the longest uh running inmates for death row too um-hum and then we had another guy uh Ronald Lafferty that thought God told him to kill his sister-in-law yeah he just got a a new trial because the judge felt that he was incompetent um-hum uh how do you feel about the death penalty well i you you know until recently i've been sort of could go either way you know it it sort of doesn't much you know didn't it wasn't a strong issue um i guess it still isn't a strong issue but i must say i find it very silly the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes um instead of dealing with real you know the real problems they're you know they're they're they're getting votes presumably by oh um i assume they're doing it for that reason well i'm sure sure that's their by by by saying well this doing this this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now well i kind of agree agree with terrorism i think those guys should be done away with that's one of the worst crimes in my book and uh drug dealing hm that's close but uh terrorism definitely and uh selling out your country um-hum it it's not it's not enough just to lock them up forever uh no it's got to be something that is gonna cost them because we never lock anybody up forever um not often not very often at all we've got these guys in New York that uh i'm sure you heard about the ones that killed ah the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis people yep yep and i guess they got convicted the four of um-hum uh uh murder right so you've come to a definite opinion on it now well i i've uh it it it it seems like it's gone gotten carried away um and i i do find it hard to draw know where to draw a line and so if i had to draw a line i'd say just no capital punishment i mean i don't i don't see i don't see that it accomplishes a whole lot whereas i do think that convicting people and and incarcerating them for a long time if that could be improved upon that would have more impact i think yeah you kind of hate to no what what about the argument where where somebody who is committing one capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime i mean murder um because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone doesn't this doesn't this encourage you mean uh violence uh more serious doesn't doesn't this encourage you know i mean doesn't this encourage murder in order to wipe out the the witnesses the witnesses well maybe it would uh i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment uh as it is i think that people who uh infringe on other people's rights uh and screw up their whole lives with rape uh child molesting uh terrorism just a there's just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for but i'm i'm for it for certain reasons yeah um-hum and i think that things like rape uh you can't get over uh takes a lifetime i see so so if if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty you believe he should have been uh executed um if it was a six person jury could've decided either way of course yeah if it was it'd probably have to be a pattern you know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back and uh if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them um-hum well but there the problems that they just been let out of jail good pardon the problem there is that they've been let out jail if they've been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer yeah but we don't seem to keep them long enough and then they learn such bad things in jail that isn't a place of rehabilitation yeah well yeah that's that's for sure yeah it's a tough question isn't it on whether at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society can't afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances um-hum yeah hm let's see so the other questions that they wanted was whether the place that we live in uh compares to how we feel what's the laws there in DC i actually don't  well we have an easy subject today i guess easier than trying to straighten the government out which was yesterday oh that was a would be difficult yeah i had one on immigration oh i didn't get that one thank goodness oh well you know i've been i went to back to school a few years ago and i tell you i haven't done much entertaining since i know i i don't have the money to entertain so that's another consideration exactly i mean even hamburgers you know when you get all the fixings with it it's kind of uh expensive well i know and uh time seems to be such a element nowadays exactly you've got to get things that it can be done ahead or and the house has to be clean that's the worse part to me yeah that way i have to get my husband to help me with that because i'd never never be able to entertain otherwise oh yeah do you have children oh well that's one less thing to mess up the house yeah i have two i have uh one that's in uh college and one that's uh in high school no yeah that's true do you have it ah well i've got three black pets three two dogs and a cat and so i've got plenty of pet hair to contend with oh oh yeah i've got that too i have everything in the we're a family of slobs on top of that so the cleaning really is the worse for entertaining well i guess they wanted us to talk about the the recipes i mean what do you what do you cook right well one of the easy things uh when i did used to entertain that i like to make is uh chicken in wine it's real easy and i can make it ahead of time and then just stick it in the oven to uh to heat up you know so i don't really like to actually cook when people are already there uh-huh exactly i like to be able to entertain and not be killing myself while right and it makes me nervous if they're all in the kitchen messing and i'm trying to cook stuff you know what i mean uh-huh and um so that's one thing that i used to make a lot see usually we just like like you said i like to do something i can do you know and just put it in the fridge but i i'll make a chicken and rice and mushrooms dish or you know uh easy stuff i don't i i i don't do that much um-hum um that sounds good we've done shish kabob several times and people always like that but it's a lot of work uh-huh yeah because the vegetables are so hard you have to kind of parboil them a little um-hum and then um season the stuff and marinade it and then stick it on all those things so you'd think it would be easy but it's actually you know quite a bit of work at the last minute it's not so bad because you can throw it on the grill and it doesn't take very long but boy the prepreparation of cutting all that up in the right sizes and washing it and like i said parboiling some of the hard stuff um-hum exactly well that's the problem for me like cooking Chinese food because you know they always have tons of vegetables ooh yeah it chop forever exactly i've never done that for um party well i'll do it when we have a few people over but not a lot it's too it's too much for that um-hum i know but i mean i've been known to go over to Sam's and and uh buy a a pan of uh ready made like enchiladas or or something i didn't like the enchiladas very much but they had some um oh are they good someone said the lasagna was good the lasagna is very good and i've made that as well i think it must be good because i have an Italian neighbor down the street that bought some for company i thought golly she she she cooks a lot too and i if she bought it it must be pretty good yeah and you know when you i mean when you've got company on on days that you work it's almost impossible oh well it is so you know that's that's for me the easiest thing to do get something i don't think i ever had something on a day i worked oh well man that's horrible where do you work oh i have um over i work at Park Central over it's at say LB yeah Central and LBJ and i work for a liquor distiller Park Central on Central Expressway is it oh do they give you any samples at Christmas yes they do we get two bottles oh well that's nice that's the another expensive part about entertaining if you plan to drink i mean that is really expensive exactly no we have beer and wine and that's about it yeah that's what most people have nowadays yeah it's just too hard to get yeah to get all the you know the different kinds of oh this person likes gin this one for big parties at least i know you could could spend well over a hundred a hundred fifty dollars getting all that stuff yeah so anyway well what do you do for desserts oh dessert um sometimes i buy it i have through the years i used to make this really neat pie that was was with crackers and pecans on yeah and you bake it and then you put whipped cream on the top it's just delicious um sometimes you can get it at Luby's restaurant oh that's sounds good hum i uh let's see i usually make a well something easy stuff as usual but you know the things that you can buy the ready made crusts and and then put like um-hum oh uh we'll have a chocolate nut pie um pie and you know um you make up the homemade filling but you use the oh that's a good idea yeah exactly so i can't even remember oh i used i used to make a cheesecake with a easy recipe using Eagle Brand milk you know but it was it was pretty good um-hum and there was a time when i made Grand Boule and English Truffle oh see and i just don't i don't dare try all that stuff because i don't even know if i like it to begin with if i don't like it it doesn't get made around here that's right oh that's the way i am we haven't bad a baked ham dinner since we've been married for twenty five years my i hate baked ham for dinner my husband's family loved it they're Polish and they live in New Jersey and that was one of their big deals was baked ham so you had to suffer through it when you were there oh God yeah they'd have it a lot of time for Christmas um-hum i couldn't stand it because my family always say  okay um tell me about where you live i live in uh Richardson area uh-huh just close to uh Richland College do you live in the area too yeah no i live in Houston oh okay although i did live in Dallas for uh six years up until uh nineteen ninety and then i i moved to Houston hm um-hum but uh i uh had lived in Houston before and uh from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and uh lived worked downtown uh-huh and when i was transferred from Atlanta uh to Houston i i bought a condo in southwest Houston uh-huh no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didn't think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour right so so after it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in Houston traffic because where i lived in Atlanta was i lived right on Peachtree um a mile and a half from the office oh uh-huh and so i wasn't accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to Houston i said i i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live um in really inner city and uh but it's only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it um-hum well what kind of a a house is it now are you still in a condo well i'm in an apartment oh okay but uh it's just i don't know it's uh i mean most most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from thirty to forty five minutes some of them an hour or more one way um-hum and you know i mean i've i've had a house before and i mean and it's nice but it's just not worth it to me to sit behind the wheel of a car for that long right i just i can't do it so right anyway i'm very i'm i'm pretty content for the time being where i am oh we um rent a duplex right now and it's only like a couple of miles from where i work it's a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at TI and it was only like two miles from the uh duplex uh-huh now he's moved but he's going against the flow of the traffic so it's not too bad of a commute it only takes him about fifteen minutes uh-huh that isn't that isn't bad really no he can get on the highway and he's going north whereas most of the people are like in Plano going south so he's you know in a good situation because the traffic is not as heavy in his direction but we've been looking for a house but the first consideration to us is location you know they keep building yeah further and further out and of course you can get more house for the money and stuff but you know to me i'm the same way that day to day commute i don't like right uh you know it's like i said i i mean i've even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i don't deny it but at the same time i said well you know let's think about it i said i drive um less than ten miles a day round-trip and they go you know they're jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day round-trip commuting and you know that doesn't that's regardless of the weather if it's raining it still doesn't take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how Houston is it's just so flat uh-huh and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and it'll take them an hour and a half to get to work um-hum and they're just frayed by the time they get there i think no way so yeah and i think too now we both have little bit older cars i mean both our cars are over ten years old now if you get a house if you buy a house more for your money further out you're gonna have to have a pretty decent car and put a lot into uh your car payments and your gas and stuff that's right i mean you know if you've got to drive it sixty miles a day you're gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean that's not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas oh i agree with you a hundred percent since i'm um moved got this place i mean i used to i can remember years ago when i worked especially whenever i lived in Houston before i used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car um-hum last year i put less than twelve on my car um you know and you you can really tell a difference i mean i just don't you know it's just not um-hum i don't have that expense and by the time i cut down the the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense um-hum i don't know it's i i thought about it it's i mean i would like to own again i've owned in the past but i don't know i'm i'm hesitant to give up the convenience yeah plus where i live is so well managed i mean if i have any little thing go wrong i just pick up the phone at the office i call my manager i said we got this problem i come home in the afternoon there's a note on my dining room table saying we've been in we fixed it let us know if there's a problem you know i love it i'll be honest with you hey it um-hum  Texas well it's been beautiful this week about uh seventy two something like that it's gotten cooler today i think it's probably sixty boy oh boy that's nice and warm but sunshiny yeah oh yeah it is a little bit warm right now what's the humidity like we don't have high humidity like Houston does it's probably gee i don't know Dallas uh-huh where we have a little bit of humidity but not like the southern part of the state does because we're up the north of the Red River so now you're in Dallas is that what you not like right so at that oh probably sixty fifty sixty pretty pretty average for this time of the year no it's a little bit below above average i would think our average now is around sixty five sixty to sixty five something like that i don't really know but ah it's it's warmer than it normally is this time of year yeah course didn't you have some uh was it tornado watches not too long ago or hurricane or something maybe it wasn't right in Dallas but uh a flush flash floods or uh-huh no we oh we always so a lot of times we do have flooding when because it's so much cement here now the water doesn't have anywhere to go because it's built up so much but it's built up so much yeah that i think they didn't think about the water when the they paved everything right right don't think where it's gonna have to go huh that's true but yeah we even have flash flooding come you know if we get four or five inches of rain we do have flooding so if it's quickly you know real quick yeah that's true what where are you in Idaho if it comes pretty quickly and Twin Falls it that's kind of by uh have you heard of Sun Valley or Boise Twin Falls i've been through Twin Falls several years ago yeah it's beautiful out there really is nice yeah it really is nice oh have you then you know where i am yeah it's it's kind of pretty we don't have uh any snow on the ground it what is your temperature it's probably in the forties yeah well we're supposed to get i think to the thirties tonight are you so it's cooling up makes you feel a little bit better for that's a real switch though from seventy five in the morning to thirty at night though um we we probably go from the forties to the twenties yeah well we don't have that too often but it's gradually clearing off i think yesterday was in the seventies because i haven't heard the temperature today really but i did go shopping and it's cooler than it was yesterday but it right may be do you need a jacket uh yes a light one i didn't wear one because i don't like a jacket i just wore a sweatshirt but no jacket yeah but it's beautiful and uh and that does it but i i have never seen a white Christmas so we we don't usually you don't know what it is everybody around here is gone crazy because they want a white Christmas and no i've never seen huh-uh well i did i would like to have one too but i yeah i i think it'd be great they're pretty they're they uh they're the type of thing you only wanna have once they're not as fun to drive in but they're sure yeah it i mean gets you in the spirit but we have cold weather sometimes and most of our cold weather is in like January January and February but we had some cold weather in November so it's just crazy and uh you just don't know exactly what to expect when it goes like that do you kind of no well yeah it it gets cold here it's just that it doesn't stay cold like i'm not sure how it is where you are but you know in the northern states it gets cold and stays cold all winter stays that way and the snow usually stays yeah and here right and here we be get cold and we may be cold for a week you know down in the twenties and teens and then it's back up to the forties and fifties yeah so it's it's right then it shoots back up this uh our area pretty much you get oh we got snow for Thanksgiving and about three days later it was all gone so i'd it doesn't stick around very long uh-huh do you think your weather trends are changing well you know we've only lived here four and a half years and uh it's been fairly mild um-hum from what i understand uh they've they've talked about being snowed in and and we've never had a bad bad winter well i i yeah i think the weather trends are changing too now i don't know whether it's everywhere or just here because we've had so many lakes built around here that i think it right do you think that's making a difference oh yeah yeah i think it's making the difference in that we have more bad weather than we used to uh-huh especially storms than you're used to but you they built the lakes for water and i do think it's made a difference in the the weather here i think the weather seems like it's changed everywhere a little bit hasn't it just uh real peculiar peculiar and not normal yeah well well i guess it's part of the warming trends and then too they say the that uh volcano in the Philippines you know had a effect on well uh right right we got a lot of the effects from that that and that's hard to believe isn't it you wouldn't you wouldn't think we could even be remotely supposedly i know  okay now where do you live i live in Richardson Texas oh well we're pretty close then you bet well see our subject was gun control yes i'm sort of uh prejitice prejudiced on this subject because that's my vocation that's what i do for a living because i'm a i'm a manufacturer's sales rep and i sell hunting and shooting supplies working working for eighteen different companies so i would guess i would be sort of pro well i guess we have something in common then because i don't think it's guns pro pro guns but uh okay that are the problem it's it's the people no i agree one hundred percent i mean they're just an inanimate object until they are in the hands of someone who is who is violent or has a a sick warped mind i agree with you one hundred percent Jean i'll tell you that somewhere i saw a bumper sticker years ago i'd like to see more of them i think uh speaking from my my viewpoint think it read something like uh when guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns exactly and i think that sort of speaks for itself i believe uh in some gun control but i think it's and i you know in selling to the industry or selling for the industry to dealers i think that it's the federal government's stand that should be taken and i think that dealers now or to buy a gun now an individual just has to go in a store and and show his drivers license and if he has a Texas state drivers license and if he lives in Texas he can go to any gun dealer and buy a gun merely by filling out a yellow form and and paying for the firearm and leaving with it at the time right it would be it would be handy if they had you know computers being like they are if they'd have some kind of a computer program on a national level where you could just dial an eight hundred number and and run a check on someone right i would be for something like that yes it would uh but then too the people who who have guns already um some of them they may have had this gun for twelve years before they uh become mentally unbalanced and use it that's true and otherwise i mean if someone is going to get a gun uh and is determined to get a gun and commit some some act they're going to get it whether they can walk in a store and buy it or if they have to break into a house across town or something you know they're going to get one absolutely but uh no you and i i think have the same idea that guns are not the problem yeah i've heard a lot of people say why i wouldn't have a gun in my house they're too dangerous ignorance is what's dangerous you bet absolutely uh i have uh many grandchildren and they have all been raised in the house with guns with loaded guns they have been taught the danger of guns how to handle them um from the time well i had a granddaughter that i raised and from the time that she was um three or four she knew that the gun that i had was not to be touched and that it was dangerous and i never had to worry about her well that's wonderful but uh anytime that she would have friends come i would put i had a closet that would lock and any gun firearms that were loaded we usually keep a uh twelve gauge shotgun loaded and then my handgun and anytime that there were other children in the house i had i put them in the closet that locked just for safety sake well that's great we've always done the same thing and being in the business i've sold guns for twenty seven years i'm fifty two years old and i've sold guns for twenty seven years worked for some major manufacturers like Winchester and people like that and and i always consider a a firearm i know they're very dangerous but i always consider everything a sporting firearm and i realize that just as you say some people don't think of them as that but that's how i think of them being that i'm in the business but main thing is just be education and communication on the subject and that's something we have always tried to do and i'm a strong believer in that yes i think that these children that find guns and shoot themselves or another child uh if they if they knew what they were playing with they wouldn't do it absolutely right because they would my son-in-law one of the when the boys were just very very small he was educating them about the guns and he took a watermelon out and set it up on uh this little rise out on the desert where they live right  did you hear the topic something about a food wasn't it uh-huh what was what was it exactly yeah well okay i heard it a lot of times i should know it by now um um talk about food and cooking and then it got into um what would uh i guess what foods would you serve at a dinner party um and share a recipe if you have one or something like that share a recipe huh i'll let you go first oh i'm not much of a cook in fact i'm standing here going through a pile of stuff looking for my cookie cutters to do my Christmas cooking oh yeah oh but uh i don't give dinner parties the most extravagant i get is pizza for twenty but um i don't know but yeah well the thing i like at at most dinner parties i just i like vegetable trays yeah just the the you know dip with the oh broccoli and cauliflower and you know things like that well oh really a healthy person uh i think that both are good i like i like those and then i pretzels and things like that but far as fancy recipes go though well i'm impressed no do you cook much uh well i'm in charge of the barbecue i think that is pretty common once in a while i'll cook uh i'll cook Sunday dinner and we'll have uh uh yeah right uh-huh it is um-hum i i have a very limited uh group of things i can cook i will cook a pot roast too once in a while or or uh oh i've i've cooked the turkey before Thanksgiving but uh uh-huh i'm not much of a cook really no well i'm not either i bought a precooked turkey for Thanksgiving yeah oh is that right does that take long to just have to heat it up is that all oh that's right well it was one of those smoked ones so it was pretty good oh i never tried those yeah it was pretty good it we got it we got it real cheap is why we got it and i'll probably do it next year to it saved an awful lot of work oh uh-huh yeah that that turkey's about a three or four hour project you have to keep checking on it and see if that little thing pops up and yeah that's right see mine never came out good anyway so i figure it's not gonna come out well i might as well not waste all my time on it and just get something oh um-hum oh what's worked well for us is put one of those um cooking bags that seems to have helped things a little bit yeah they just slip i guess you've seen them they're plastic oh really yeah i've never really tried one though and they don't they don't seem to melt obviously but uh they keep it uh warm moist and tender huh uh-huh hm well i don't have much else to say on this topic well this isn't my favorite well i'll be honest with you i've gotten a i've gotten some interesting ones in the past i was just on a jury recently oh and the toof - days after i got off the jury one of my topics the first day was what do you think of juries and and the jury system and the next day was what do you think of capital punishment so it was pretty funny because i had a lot to say on that oh is that right uh-huh i i work for a law firm so i probably could've responded to that one you know oh really well that's good well listen it was good talking to you and i hope your wife's feeling better alrighty yeah i kind of think she will be alrighty bye now well good all right bye-bye well good all right bye-bye  what are you guys having for Christmas what are we having let's see well i'm not planning the menu oh you're not no we usually go out to either either one of our folks they both live close to but um yeah i don't know it seems like a a big thing for Christmas is usually ham well funny you should mention that i'm a pig farmer yeah oh you are huh well now it's kind of a hobby more than anything else but we're going to have uh wild boar my goodness we uh we killed a boar the other day it was you know mating with the sows and you can't use the piglets you know so huh it's about six months of no use so we uh we shot him and cleaned him out and had him you know processed into ham and uh we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig because i've i've got one that's got a a hernia oh really yeah and rather than you know pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery we'll just cook him and eat him is that is that hard oh no hey i tell you what preparing a little pig is is a snap i'm telling you it really is it's easier than chicken oh really yeah you just uh you kill him you know you probably most guys just shoot them in the head they go you know in a second they're gone and then you just dip the carcass in uh boiling water oh pull it out and there's a we use a little raspy brush pulls the hair off and uh gut it and uh just stick it down in a pit with some cloves and uh some pineapple couple about three pineapples you know sliced them up and uh cover him up with uh wet uh sacks feed sacks is what i usually use and then start a charcoal fire on top of him huh oh my goodness and after about six hours you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there and it's the best eating you ever had oh well does a boar taste just like regular ham it's just like a pig i mean you know uh it has a lot less fat does that huh uh this this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds oh my God oh my goodness well you and we took the skin and the head and the leg and the feet off and that was about you know a hundred hundred pounds of just ham oh well how many people are you planning on serving at Christmas oh well we're you know we're not going to eat the whole thing gee that take a year but uh you know we're gonna drive up to Kansas City see my wife's folks eat it all yeah and uh she she what's what's what's your mother cooking for Christmas yeah well her mom's doing brisket i don't what is brisket brisket it's a part of the cow that they used to throw away huh it's just tough as a boot oh and uh you know they used to use it for leather i think oh my goodness no i mean no i'm just kidding yeah but uh it's it's a part of the loin you know the rib cage and it has a lot of muscles in it and a lot of gristle where it attaches to the ribs so it's really really a tough piece of meat but it's so tasty you can't stand it oh my goodness huh so you just take it and you marinate it for a couple of days and that softens it up huh huh and then uh you just put it in the oven takes about four hours to cook one they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds oh gee and uh we're gonna have that well what else just serve with your pig pig oh well we'll have cranberries and hominy and uh we we are we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here huh so we have olive olives black olives and cucumbers and uh tomatoes we still have tomatoes oh do you yeah fresh tomatoes oh we we just got lots of snow well it started to freeze up around here we there there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire and half of that's down i mean it's thirty degrees this morning oh really yeah but uh it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost huh oh my goodness i didn't know it got that low at night but oh yeah well it's desert you know where where we are it's it's it's uh the edge of the desert i mean it's part of the Great Plains so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred a hundred and ten at night it goes down to about sixty oh gee my goodness yeah we get a fifty degree degree temperature swing in about four hours oh boy so everything that lives around here is real tough oh like the trees you know we got hundred year old trees that are you know twenty feet tall oh gee that's it that's all the bigger they get they you know they're just hard as a rock  okay go ahead all right well what kind of car would i wanna buy i don't know yeah the question is i mean would i want to buy or would i would i probably actually buy may be two different things oh well if you if you had all your all the money in the world or something i don't if i had all the money i wanted then that's whole different matter yeah uh yeah no the car in in that case i'd i'd i don't know i i my dream car for years was a was a Porsche Turbo Carrera uh-huh uh-huh but uh i don't know if i'd want one of those now well i of course i would want one if somebody was was giving it to me but i maybe would buy a BMW oh really well uh-huh um or or even a Volvo what do you have now i've got a a uh a Dodge Daytona um-hum hm it's actually the first car we ever bought new and everything oh really yeah we just we well i have my car is the first one we ever bought new too but we just bought another used car a couple weeks ago actually uh-huh what uh-huh me yeah me too so so what car do you drive what is it um mine is a Honda Accord and uh-huh we almost bought one of those do you like it yeah i do and and um it's funny because after i bought it i was doing a lot of business traveling and i some of the cars that i got were like the Toyota Camry and the Nissan Maxima and some of the competitors um-hum um-hum and um i didn't like them as well except it wasn't really fair comparison because those were automatics and mine is a standard and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better it had a lot more pickup and everything yeah yeah uh-huh yeah yeah you get a little more control over when it when it's doing the things it's doing yeah um so what what rental agency did you go to to actually rent to to rent those kind of cars uh-huh um usually Avis to what Avis really Avis yeah yeah huh i guess well it's just because we're on uh i think of it i'm not sure if those are Avis or not but we have corporate contracts i see you know with the various companies so it depends on your destination too it's kind of strange uh-huh right you work for a big company then work for TI um-hum which is how i heard about this TI i uh-huh um but yeah i i uh i don't know i i would probably if i were to buy a car myself you know and with the constraints of the real of the of real money i probably would would um-hum go with something like you you know like the Honda Accord maybe it would it one thing i i really liked about about the Dodge Daytona is the fact that they have uh um this seven year warranty um-hum oh really um and it really saved us some big money once it did wow yeah they had a whole bunch of things that that sort of broke at the same time oh my gosh and uh the bill would've been over fifteen hundred dollars and i had to pay twenty five for the oh that is great that's unusual to hear usually you know if something breaks you look at the warranty and it's excluded yeah well the well we we bought the extended the the extension oh i see okay and uh at the time we bought it it was like you know it was i don't know four hundred and twenty five dollars or something extra oh well you got your money's worth yeah we did but you know we really debated at the beginning and of of course i'm glad i did it yeah yeah that is good but um we still have we still have like you know couple three years left on it yeah well i've been lucky mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it yeah oh no but i was real lucky because it just hit the um the lens to the light it didn't actually dent the car or anything so it cost me twenty five bucks to replace that bumper oh well that's good are and the store will pay for it anyway so uh-huh no big deal um if you were if you were going to uh buy a new car would you buy another uh another Accord um i probably wouldn't just because we already have one um-hum but you know if i had to make the choice again i yeah i'd i'm perfectly happy with what i decided um although we did just buy another car and that's a Legend um but it's it's a used one uh-huh oh yeah those are nice and uh-huh and um my husband has really wanted one for a long time and the fact that you know this car this car that i have has performed so well and before that i also had an Accord it was a real old one um-hum and um i bought that used i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that and it served me real well too so he's been impressed with all the Honda cars hm right and yeah my sister drives one she drives a uh um i don't know is it Legend it's uh um-hum oh i'm not certain though but she's liked it um yeah but i i have i have never had and we in fact what i'm driving right now we bought a we only had one car for a long time and um-hum and yet most of our usage of the car was just this little shuttle back and forth you know from four miles to work and back kind of thing uh-huh and so uh i bought a used Yugo just to be a little you know a little car that i could care less about just waste yeah uh-huh yeah how did it go for you oh well it's uh it's worked you know it i mean it's exactly what it is you know it's just a it's a cheap lit tle you know little car just to go you know running run around town in and uh hasn't left you stranded yeah i know yeah it's actually kind of fun to drive i i i you know getting back in the Daytona now i almost don't like it you know it's just like too too mushy and it you know it's it's an automatic and the really huh well that's what my husband thinks about my car now that he's had the Legend it's wimpy it's too it's the steering is just you know you feel like you're in a boat or something you know it's kind of i can't drive that the Legend it's just so huge i i don't like it and it's so uh oh  well what kind of music do you like Beverly well i play piano and organ and have since i was a child and i sing in church choir and have done that since i was a child and still sing now oh oh that's great and uh i play cello in high school and college and occasionally play as an adult but i don't have a cello and i rarely ever practice so it's like adult groups that's i teach school adult groups at school or something when they are in dire need of somebody uh-huh uh-huh so i still pick it up occasionally yeah but uh my son is a music major he's uh in performing French horn he was an all state French horn player all through high school and uh-huh so there's a lot of music in our family well that's terrific i think it's wonderful that you got that that you play an instrument that you passed it on to your children i uh um as as a child reluctantly took piano for for uh i guess three years and you know looking back i'm i'm really happy that i had that experience because certainly i i learned some basics about music that i would've been completely ignorant of had i not had those lessons um-hum um i i wish now of course you know in in hindsight that i had uh uh uh kept it up but i didn't but nonetheless i i do have some uh rudimentary knowledge of uh the scales and the keys and the chords and et cetera um-hum do you do anything with music nowadays other than buy it prerecorded no you you buy it and listen to it huh exactly yeah and and uh what i i i am kind of i've got a real nice stereo system that i've invested too much money in and you know all the latest gadgets and but i do enjoy good music um-hum and uh i've got quite a wide uh repertoire i mean i've i've got everything from classical to jazz or rock and roll to blues i mean it's just i i cover the whole gamut and it depends on the mood i'm in uh um-hum and for instance Sunday mornings with coffee and the newspaper i for some reason like to listen to classical music and uh other times it you know just something completely different will strike me i i like almost everything except rap i i do too i don't really care that much for rap the only thing i i've liked uh with rap is is when the kids at school uh will take information and they'll learn it by making a rap out of it and then i think it's useful otherwise i don't have any use for it yeah well it's it's the first time something that has come along that makes me feel that you know i am obviously of another generation this is a there's gap between me and rap music and i guess um-hum um-hum i understand you know that's just i don't relate to it at all but then again i'm that's um-hum it it's definitely a a huge hit with the younger people they seem to like it they do well my eldest son took piano for oh about four years and lost interest but he learned enough that he can still sit down and play and enjoys doing that and has a keyboard uh-huh and then my daughter uh took piano for a while she also played bassoon and then she has taken dance well she took dance from the time she was about five on up through first part of college and she got so involved in dance and that sort of thing that she let the instruments kind of slide behind uh-huh and but yet she still enjoys uh music and still enjoys dance and you know for exercise she wants aerobics to music and that you know that kind of thing yeah yeah well you sound like you've got a very talented family well they do have quite a bit of musical ability which is is nice uh we do enjoy good music and uh like however uh with the kids going through college and we have two in college right now they are the ones that have the stereos we we don't seem to have much stereo one of these days we will yeah uh-huh it yeah yeah really well um uh uh what was i gonna ask i was there was a question that's on the tip of my oh yeah as far as a voice did you ever have any uh uh voice coach either or lessons the the only ones that i ever had were actually through the church where they had uh or a voice teacher uh offer lessons at sort of at a discount you might say for members of the choir who were interested so i did that a couple of times right but as far as as any other training no i just it was uh what i learned through singing in choirs and um my other music piano and the organ and the cello a friend of mine the reason i ask a friend of mine and her sister both took voice for oh i guess three or four years and they sing like angels they have the most they you know um-hum um-hum they're just beautiful and i wonder how much of it is innate talent and how much of that is a a function of of how much they've learned and and retained um-hum well there has to be some talent there there has to be some voice something to work with something to work with right i mean you can only overcome so much but there are tricks to make right  um do you have any elderly parents or grandparents that have ever had to go in a nursing home uh yes my uh mother was in a nursing home for five years before she passed away in nineteen seventy seven oh oh now was it how did you feel about that was it a good nursing home and you felt good about her being there or it was a fair nursing home a fair one uh it it was a matter uh she reached the point where she couldn't stay by herself during the daytime she and my sister who never married lived together um-hum oh and my sister couldn't retire at the time so my uh mother's physician recommended that uh she go into a nursing home uh-huh uh-huh oh uh-huh and fortunately my sister was able to go visit her twice a day oh wow that is good and uh boy i'll say that is good she she just reached the point where she had to have professional care she was eighty two at the time um-hum my word so she couldn't take care of herself at all yeah did how did she feel about it did she how did your mother feel about it well i don't think she ever really adjusted didn't she uh my mother was very very shy she never joined anything oh oh and uh she realized that it was something that had to be done uh-huh but she had begun to lose a great deal of of her memory capacity at the time oh um-hum and finally about uh oh say about a year before she died my sister was the only person that she ever really recognized and could call by name my word oh oh boy now what about the expense part of it was it an expensive one or did her did she have health insurance or Medicaid uh no uh oh several years before well it's a long thirty minute story but uh when my father died in nineteen fifty eight uh i uh transferred the title to my sister um-hum oh uh which was an internal family deal i i knew that if something happened and my sister couldn't take care of her i would uh-huh oh uh-huh but uh uh we had fixed it for her uh oh many years before she went into the nursing home like about fifteen so that she had no assets so as it turned out Medicaid paid for all of it uh-huh oh oh oh great uh well that helps because i know that it can take a person's whole life life savings i yeah yeah yeah um my parents are not quite that old yet but my grandmother um right now is in this situation where she cannot stay alone at home either and so um her she has four daughters and one son and the four daughters rotate and keep her for three months at a time and they are all in a position where they can do that right now and then my husband's grandmother about oh probably two years ago she fell and broke her hip um-hum um-hum um-hum and of course she had to go into the nursing home there and and it was a fairly nice one in fact she got to where she enjoyed it there she knew the staff and knew the other people that were there and and in fact when she came home she was able to get better and come home she really missed the association with the people there um-hum and i but i don't know i i whenever i go into a nursing home i uh for some reason it it makes me feel sad i because i a lot of people i know are there just because um you know their families want them there and and they don't they aren't willing to take care of them and i i think that's a sad situation yeah um my my uh other sister um-hum uh who was married at the time and was still working um-hum worked for several years in a nursing home and she said roughly half oh uh-huh of the people don't have anybody oh no and nobody ever comes to see them my word that many of them yeah that's too bad oh boy i it is i i don't know a nursing home seems to be such a a non personal environment the ones that i've been to um i have been to one that seemed really you know warm and cozy but for the most part they've seemed you know no carpet on the floors and just kind of cold and i i yeah i know and they all seem understaffed and the staff's overworked right that's right yeah so well let's face it there there for the most part well there's one exception that i'll tell you about in a minute uh for the most part they're profit centers uh-huh that's right uh but uh my my sister who looked after my mother that's right uh let's see she died in ninety so this would have been the first of the year in nineteen eighty nine she made uh-huh uh-huh  of the exercise program you have well um i have a a a former exercise program i'm a graduate student and this semester i'll tell you what i it's been almost impossible for me to get you know back to regular exercise right um last summer i was a a swim instructor all all summer and and lifeguard so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming and um and since i worked at a recreation center i could uh you know use those facilities quite often but um well swimming is uh one of the best exercises you can do oh yeah oh yeah i mean as far as for uh cardiovascular and uh-huh and there's and there's no jarring movements and it's least least least hard on your body i pardon it's the least hard on your body as far as uh impact and exactly yeah um fluid yeah fluid resistance right right um-hum how about you well i do uh a little aerobics oh three or four times a week but it's not enough to boy if i go the summer time i try to job jog a couple of miles and uh oh yeah i end you know even doing that three or four times a week when summer hits that's a hard thing to go out and yeah and go jogging for uh um-hum half hour or so but so i'm not quite getting the level that i need to um-hum yeah do you do you kind of think it's a chore or do you enjoy it i like it um-hum i like it uh part of my problem is i have small children so oh to do a whole lot it just requires a lot of oh coordination as far as scheduling and um-hum sure yeah that type of uh deal you know uh when you're in college boy you get a hundred things going on course you're got a little different direction going but uh uh-huh yeah uh i um i used to uh i i used to weigh uh two hundred fifteen pounds and now i only weigh about one about one seventy five um so i drastically had to change the way i ate uh when i when i first moved to college and uh i i had started weight lifting quite regularly and so i got my weight down and it's kind of easy for me to to forget about it now because uh you know when i'm not fat like i used to be uh you know i just don't worry about it you know right you don't notice as much yeah um-hum although lately i have noticed you know even if i gain like two pounds i start i start feeling it and you feel it don't you it's amazing how uh um-hum how much uh it changes and i weigh probably about the same i've weighed for oh i don't know how many years but uh it's changed places and things don't fit just quite exactly yeah fit the same uh-huh but uh so do you do a uh in Texas uh there's a probably quite a few few facilities yeah there are um i'm living in a dorm right now and so right downstairs there's a facility and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where all you know all we have to do is is uh run down there and do you enjoy it or is it uh i really do if i have the time to if you can have find the time it's just the um-hum yeah i really do because i like to get you know get off alone and just do that for a while but that's hard you know yeah it is hard it is hard it's uh like anything else whether or not you wanna sacrifice another half hour my problem is i don't wanna wake up another half hour earlier um-hum um-hum exactly and do more don't get enough sleep as it is right um-hum uh-huh yeah yeah and uh kind of have if you're having the pressures of school and uh everything else it's kind of course it's really you know as soon as you do it it's really a release oh yeah you feel invigorated and you feel um-hum oh you feel so in a lot better shape just like eating right foods yeah ready to go another twelve hours yeah if i eat too very much sugar boy it just does something yeah um-hum do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly um-hum i do i have to be real careful um-hum i stopped eating meat about oh uh must have been eight months ago uh-huh completely i mean any kind of meat or did you and i and i really feel a lot better now you that really does makes a lot of difference well there's a lot of fat in meat um-hum yeah that's it i mean that's about where almost all of the fat comes from and and so i found that really helps right and unless you really like uh fish fish is pretty good for you but uh yeah i eat that i think i've eaten fish like twice since i used to eat a lot of fish too but i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happened kind of see what happens i i've tried to do that with sugar and it yeah and i like it and i i i don't know if i'm that brave yet it's almost impossible everything has sugar in it i mean if you go your ketchup has sugar in it uh-huh uh-huh course and i like sugar too that's um-hum that's uh a problem but anyway well it's uh nice talking to you think we've uh covered all the subject okay yeah it sounds good okay well good luck to you there in Idaho well you too good luck uh enjoy college while you can let me tell you it's uh well i'm in graduate school now i i i kind of feel like i wish i could've gone back to undergraduate now yeah it's a little different uh challenge isn't it yeah it is well it's good talking pardon i'm studying speech pathology i where are you going studying right  uh what topic would you like to discuss political topic oh i don't know i guess the thing that's on my mind lately is these hostages that have been released so i can't imagine how it would've been to been incarcerated incarcerated for that length of time well i think it's marvelous they finally figured a way to get them out of there huh i'm not sure what it ever what it really accomplished having them uh locked up for that long did the uh did their captors ever really say this is why we're holding them and well what they wanted of course was uh one money and two the release of all the Palestinians held by the Israels uh-huh you know the the the Jewish folks and uh i guess they're gonna get a lot of those released and yeah i understand there's uh what several hundred or even thousands of political prisoners probably a lot i probably a lot yeah what's uh what's been pressing you lately well i think the developments in Soviet Union are rather interesting oh yeah i'm not real sure how they're gonna all turn out i hope they turn out positively and not turn into chaos but well does it sound like Gorbachev definitely out of a job to you certainly sounds that way doesn't it looks looks that way uh i'm a little disappointed and i and i think people uh yep well he's won a peace prize and uh well i think that's one of the problems being a Mister Nice Guy and i think that's what he was and is you know i i think he tried to yeah accommodate too many people uh and in a structure like that apparently it's a difficult if not impossible task i don't know yeah but Europe is huh and whether we like it or not when the USSR was together the peace was kept in Europe relatively speaking yeah yeah and uh there might be a big void there and i uh it's certainly a well fence sitting situation i i i hope it's not a i hope it gets resolved properly let's put that way yeah well it's gonna be interesting see what happens the next year there with all those nuclear weapons floating around you get uh get the wrong person there i think we could have major problems uh-huh yeah i i don't necessarily mean we in in the US alone but the world i'm curious what uh what Texans think of their neighboring state and uh recent uh gubernatorial race there with uh David Duke yeah how was the what was the press like in in Texas over that issue well of course there's a number of rednecks in Texas that i'm sure would jump on his band wagon and uh uh-huh but i'm sure the vast vast majority would think it of him as he probably is um-hum i it's remarkable that he can uh i think that he can get this far as he's gotten with uh and uh you know the kind of background he's got and i'm i'm just surprised that he has uh seems like that'd be something that be so controversial that it pretty well exclude himself from any political office well i think the South is not the nation certainly still has many racist type people that uh would jump on his band wagon uh-huh yeah and uh being a springer splinter operation i'm sure it wouldn't you know it it raises a lot of noise and everything but i don't think it would probably go very far in a yeah overall scope of things well i think we're a little isolated where i live here we just don't have many uh many blacks to speak of uh you know probably less than five percent of the population i would guess well we have a fair a fair amount of uh Hispanics and um Native Americans not too many blacks well well i think it's a i grew up in uh Milwaukee and Wisconsin and uh uh-huh i think uh you know it's definitely a different philosophy of how you look at blacks up North as you do in the South uh-huh and you know it i growing up uh where i grew up in our high school you had one black that was from out of the area to start with and you know we had three thousand kids in our high school so that was the extent of it huh we weren't really you know even you know when we played football against a couple black teams and you know that part of Milwaukee uh you know they were nothing you know i mean now now it's all the blacks in football and basketball i'll say there's they sure dominate the pro sports don't they and well and collegiate too so so i i don't i don't know what uh you know times have changed but i i think that's one of the reasons the Packers will always have problems having a getting back to the status they were during the Lombardi years and uh Green Bay being an extremely small town uh-huh of sixty thousand fifty five thousand  okay Jerry the uh topic was favorite TV shows and what kind are you interested in and how they and do they differ from like mine um-hum um-hum well okay uh most of most of the uh commercial television these days i'm just a little bit sick of uh in fact i don't watch hardly any uh television at all with uh my other activities uh between my family and my church et cetera et cetera why i don't have any time uh hardly any time to sit down and watch the news now i do watch the Discovery Channel and some on channel thirteen but aside from right oh do you yeah aside from that i pretty well uh turn it off oh i'm sort of a well i'm different from that i'm sort of a a movie buff i go to a a couple of movies movies a week sometimes quite honestly i'm i'm self-employed and a lot of times i will uh go out and take um-hum a lunch hour and go to lunch from like twelve to two and go to a movie and just come back to my office i don't blame you but uh i do it it's like entertainment i'm pretty much of a a junk movie watcher by myself if i take my wife then we see something a little nicer you know uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh but uh and my kids are all sort of movie watchers you know we've we've always been to a lot of we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life so but i would just as soon uh be doing something else it's just that my kids are gone now and and my wife's a school teacher and sometimes she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock so you know i'll come in like five thirty or six and i'll turn on the tube and uh-huh set there and have my coffee or Coke or whatever and a little TV and sometimes i set there all evening yeah i i well if sometimes if if it's real good like there's more than been there's been more than one evening that i've uh caught uh every animal show that evening on uh on the Discover Channel you bet you bet and uh because they're uh they're they're you you know they're documentaries and they're well that's an interesting channel oh you bet in fact i'm glad that it's part of our ah basic cable package well that's great you know i've i've just never spent any time watching it and you know but uh uh-huh i like my sports and everything but i oh well me too hello with the i watched my Dallas Cowboys i watched them to halftime before i left and i left at halftime and started drinking driving well they they whooped they whooped up on them they sure did they just did an excellent job uh-huh and they're in the play-offs and uh i'm not sure that the Eagles are or not yeah the Eagles you have to laugh the luck into it now i think but the Cowboys they earned it on their own merit i did yeah that's true well and you know everybody or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on Mister Johnson but uh he's uh he's brought the pokes uh from a a one and something team to a play-offs in what three years now you you bet as much as everyone you know and use the word love Tom Landry you know i'm glad that Jimmy Johnson's there uh-huh well it's uh you know it was a time for the passing of the guard i mean and i think Tom knew it it was i think so too he wanted to go out a winner though i think he would've stayed there four or five more years so he could have gone out a winner so um yeah that's true and i wouldn't i wouldn't have blamed him one bit because no no it's you know he earned those stripes yeah but see nobody remembers him as a loser i know because he's too he's too far he's far too much of a gentleman and a and a practicing Christian to uh to ever be thought of as anything but a loser you know but a winner oh yes you bet he's a he's a winner in anyone's book and i hope he's a winner in his own book you know because that that's the key there yeah oh he is he is because he has to like himself before he can like other people you bet uh little things that disturb me and i know he's being a little hard-nosed about it but uh you know this ring of honor thing you know he needs to be there um-hum because he's earned it he deserves it and he was the Dallas Cowboys and he won't do that yet so i hope he makes up his mind to do it because yes oh he will he needs to be remembered right well nobody's gonna forget Tom Landry shoot come now i mean i'm not a no no no absolutely absolutely not oh that's true but he needs to be honored put it that way betcha i'm i'm not a native Texan by birth but uh i guess by uh length of length of time i've been the state now is what after you're here twenty years you're considered a native you bet i've been here since seventy four um and i feel like a native well let's see i came down March of sixty nine went to work for T and I yeah oh did you yeah so uh i haven't looked back yet either so yeah and we came we came down from New York state in seventy four and uh never had any regrets at all right especially looking at some of the weather New York state has had and then look at the weather we have down here huh you bet it's been it's been a great place to raise our kids and i've got my last kid graduating from college this next December she's getting married the month before in November so i will have finished be finished with that uh-huh oh goodness right well we're well we're finished with all but the last one and trying to get him through his technical school right and uh we're uh he's over halfway so well good you know we're not staying on the topic of television shows but i really not too very concerned are you no not at all no me neither i i'm i'm enjoying the chat uh well but i enjoy my TV programs i like those i like those detective programs i like everything i can watch watch Bill Cosby because i think he has a great show  you think about AIDS research well AIDS is a nasty terrible disease and you die from it so i think that uh they need to look into it and it's kind of like cancer i don't you know how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer i think it'll probably be as difficult um-hum uh how about yourself um well i'm certainly in favor of AIDS research and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does i think that because besides the fact that it's a deadly disease that it's a contagious disease so that it's um although it is not killing that many people now it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem yeah they say a million people are infected with the HIV virus and um-hum uh yeah i think that's in the world or in America you uh in the country America oh really hm that's whose figure is that yeah and they they have millions i don't know uh i've just heard it on the radio sometimes you hear things that on the radio that you know could be true or couldn't be okay um-hum uh do you feel like this is a i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this AIDS research um-hum uh do you think they should spend more um i i think they should actually although probably perhaps not a an incredible amount more than what they're doing and i don't necessarily think that they should uh fund AIDS AIDS research and you know in the process neglect cancer research or whatever i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general what do you think Doug of Mister Johnson um magic what right uh well i am sorry that he has the virus i'd um i don't know i don't i think it's very strange that the media hasn't um questioned him more strongly to you know about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that as they probably would for a lot of other people do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of other a bunch of the media um well not not really though i mean i think he's probably doing the right thing for a man in his position but i don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing it's what many people have done already who are just less famous you know i took advantage of the opportunity when you know he came out i i talked to my kids about it you know it's something that i hadn't done hadn't done before uh um-hum uh-huh well that's good i'm glad that Mister Johnson's changed his tune on uh safe sex to abstinence or i i was glad he did that um-hum for young kids because a lot of kids would have ended up dying because of what he was promoting um-hum uh let's see what are some of the other questions i you don't uh let's see i don't have any friends that have the disease i guess you might might not um yeah i do my cousin does for instance is it pretty nasty and um yeah yeah it is he's actually um he had AIDS related complex for a while and he is now in full blown AIDS and really not doing very well and has various brain tumors and that sort of thing so that it's it's a very nasty thing yeah it sound awful is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly and um yeah that's that's basically it that um the immune system can at first slow down and you know the white blood cell count goes down which is and that's AIDS related complex but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom that's AIDS and and in that case you know people are prone to getting any kind of you know weird cancer that only animals got before and yeah that sort of thing oh really  i've never been to Iowa what is it like up there um well we just moved here and um the only places we've gone to for a short like one day vacation was we went to Lake MacBride which is like two or three miles north of Iowa City and it's like a big park and um there have a they have a beach side and a lake side and so just depending on what type of uh you know water i guess you're used to and i'm used to the beach so we went to the beach side because i'm really from California oh is that what you moved from California to Iowa well we moved to California and then i uh went to school in Utah and i got married in Utah and then we um lived there for a little while and then we came to Iowa what what part of California did you live in uh Santa Anna it's near Anaheim Disneyland yes i've been i've been to Anaheim yeah it's really close to there we see the fireworks from our upstairs window yeah i've i've i've been to Disneyland oh and to see the um Queen what is it the Queen Mary at Long Beach and Universal Studios i've been to that part of the world uh-huh in Long Beach uh-huh i've never been to Utah though what's Utah like well Utah actually is um one of the dryer states but it actually has some really nice scenery and um have you heard of Bryce Canyon or Zion National Park yes yes that's supposed to be really pretty yeah and um they have a lot of good skiing up there and they have um Park City and um what else they have over there i don't really ski but i just have heard that it's really good skiing over there have you have you ever been to Texas um we went there for a conference we went to we stayed in Houston for a couple days and then we visited a cousin in Dallas just for a day you know and we went to the Southfork Flea Market or the one in Southfork or you know what i mean yeah this is this is a big state we've got it differs so much whether you're in the south or north or east or west because it's so huge uh-huh yeah have you ever done any traveling up the east coast um we've only been to the east coast like once have you been to New England no well New England is really pretty all times of year but even when the leaves aren't growing in the fall it's really pretty in the in the summer time because there's a lot of interesting things up there oh they've got a lot of historical things a lot of cities that have been around three hundred and fifty years and and um or longer and have a lot of recreation of Colonial items yeah i think that would be a neat place to visit because i had a cousin who went to school at at uh Brandeis and he was talking about how it was pretty there and that's where he's wanted to grow um not grow but live there and he live in where is this now New York um he was going to school in Massachusetts and he wanted to stay on the east coast because of the surroundings and the historical part of it oh yeah well i've been to Massachusetts probably good five times up there it's really nice oh well that's a place that we have never been to but would like to go to because you know just all the historical things and well it'd probably be better in the summer time when it's warm oh is it humid there um i don't remember it being humid not in the summer anyway hm the temperatures are mild normally it's in the eighties low eighties oh hum um another i guess place to vacation is um we traveled up the California coast and we went and visited Hearst Castle and oh i've been to Hearst Castle was gonna go in up you know one on one and things like that and it's really pretty up there because you're right on the coast i made it as far as Hearst Castle but i didn't go any farther oh did you go up beyond Hearst Castle yeah just a little bit beyond oh and then um we had to take the five the rest of the way up because car trouble but we our destination was Washington and when we got up to Washington we thought it was really pretty because all the trees line the highways and did you and that's how it is in Oregon too did you go through the Redwood Forest no we didn't have time but that we've seen pictures of it i think that'd be nice to go there huh i've been through there those trees are huge you can drive a car through one of those trees it's so big wow that yeah i wish we could go and see that some time there's a there's a lot in the area what what else is up in Iowa um let's see well close by um Iowa is a place called Nauvoo that's in Illinois and uh Nauvoo it's called what now i've heard of that what is that that's a city city  where do you like to go to eat out well my favorite place to go is a a little Chinese place called um China Night and i guess that the reason i like to go there is because i like the the kind of food they serve and we've been going there for many years it's um-hum uh-huh it's an older spot it's not a real fancy type you know establishment but it is it is enjoyable and and kind of cozy and it's it's quite small um-hum so that's that's where we like to go and how about yourself well my wife and i go to this place in Denton Texas called Rocco's it's a Italian restaurant oh oh and uh well i guess first time i went there is about eight years ago i'd i'd just moved back from Florida and went over there you know with my parents uh-huh oh um-hum and uh when my wife and i got married we had our our wedding dinner there oh how fun and uh one of the things i like most about Rocco's is the people there are real people you know they're not all you know hoity-toity and all that good stuff oh um-hum uh-huh oh so there's good service good people and good food huh sure excellent service uh the food is is always hot and there's always enough um-hum oh yeah that's you know i hate when i go to a restaurant and i spend twelve bucks for a meal and you know i got to spend another twelve bucks to find the appetizers Tiffany yeah right and and then when you go home you're still hungry well that's huh that's interesting you know i've never been to an Italian restaurant and i know my sister in law was saying the other day she knew of a place little place down in yeah well it's about thirty miles from here that was a very good Italian restaurant she said and and uh we were discussing going there so i that sounds good how about fast food do you eat fast food much yeah i got cans in my cupboard i mean in a restaurant uh well uh let me put it this way the nearest Seven Eleven is about forty miles oh yeah we're out in the country oh yes you are and uh fast food for me is fuel you know it's like i buy the cheapest stuff i can find that'll hold me over till i can get home oh right right usually i don't go to fast food places because if i leave the house i generally pack my own lunch uh-huh oh oh i i cannot stand cardboard food right right i agree you know i mean you know it's nothing fancy for lunch but i you know i got celery and carrots and and pears and apples and uh uh-huh good foods that'll that's real huh yeah that's real food you know my wife will make me either a you know like a ham sandwich or turkey sandwich or something like that uh you know we raise hogs and butcher our own meat oh right uh-huh oh great we have a wide variety of uh boy i'll say yeah i i was just thinking um we have another restaurant here that's um stuff available oh it's probably it's about ten miles away from from where we live and i know it's it's pretty famous around this area it's called Mattox and and they have you know their own cows that they they um butcher and they serve there and it's it's yeah it's only open five days a week and there's always just standing room only waiting to get in it's it's an excellent uh place to eat there they serve you know good meat and a good salad and and like you say the service is good and a real nice atmosphere and i know that's a place around here that that a lot of people like to go to we we are just in our little little town that's close to us it's just starting to get a lot of eating type establishments they well it's probably been within the last oh eight years that we've even had a McDonald yeah you you go to restaurant row no we don't yet got you your McDonald's your Pizza Inn your Taco Bell and uh Burger King and Sonic and all that not yet not yet we're we're working towards that we're not but it's not quite that bad yet i hope that i don't know i hate to see that well that's that yuppie food it it it makes you have to eat bran yeah right yeah i i went seen my doctor the other day and he gave me you know two pieces of news one was good one was bad uh-huh oh the good news uh the bad news was i was gonna die uh oh the good news is that i uh i i don't have to eat bran muffins or jog because you're gonna die anyway huh well you know uh the have you seen any of the statistical reports on the the yes i have they say it doesn't really make a whole lot of difference but well yeah they say you you might extend your life of three or four months um-hum um-hum but it but it takes three or four months to get in shape so and it's painful oops i got a call oh okay well it's been pleasant speaking with you and uh call right keep going to that Italian place and i'll try one here thank okay  well let's go ahead and start with you what kind of kind of pets did you have okay well yeah when i was growing up uh we had dogs all the time so i always had at least two dogs i think at the most we had three and uh then when i met my my wife she was more of a cat person and she kind of more or less got me converted over to cats uh oh and that was the last pets that we had um but uh we we went ahead and gave them away to uh another family you know i put an ad out and had them had them take over the pets um-hum uh because we had uh we started our family and and you know the cats shed a lot and plus they were kind of rough for the babies playing with them and stuff so right um-hum we decided to not have any pets for awhile well cool uh when i was growing up we had a dog one dog and um-hum it had a disease and we had to put it to sleep and that was traumatic and that was traumatic enough for our family for the time being and oh no they have another one right now at home but i'm not there so that's kind of a bummer but yeah yeah well we're thinking of maybe as a matter of fact my wife was was telling me that uh when she was out Christmas shopping ah they had a display for one of these pet stores and they had a a cat a cat there and turned out to be ah an older cat about two years old uh-huh and uh it was really good with the boys i've i've got two boys uh-huh four years old and two years old and she said it was real good with them and uh real real tame cat and she was asking me you know when do you think we should go back and get it now or should we wait a little bit longer and and i told her well i think we should probably wait but i you know she's she's gonna want uh get least another cat uh but i think i'd like to go ahead and get get them a dog uh-huh cool yeah i kind of like dogs myself i think they're just fun to have around fun to play with i think you know i really do think that a dog is more of a a children's pet and a cat's more of an adult's pet uh-huh yeah i tend to agree with that because uh i know i i when i was younger and uh growing up with dogs i didn't like cats at all i didn't want anything at all to do with them uh-huh because you know they just don't respond to you the way dogs do and you know that and i you know i feel that that's something that that a kid looks forward to oh absolutely you know you tell a dog to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and he chases it that kind of thing and he'll he'll play with you but a cat uh-huh um-hum pretty much just keeps to himself and you know you know how cats are right well i kind of tend to agree i think especially dogs i really when we had ours i enjoyed it just because like you say you know you could throw things at it and he'd go chase it and um-hum um-hum that whenever there was you know any sense of of urgency or any sense of problems with any of my friends or anybody around our family he would just jump up there and protect us you know he was a small dog and it was just it was good to know that there was always somebody there or something there to to take care of you um-hum yeah i i agree i agree i know that uh you know your yard is always a safe haven and and then if you have got a dog back there then you're really protected because they they'll they'll stand up for you yeah exactly yeah and that's the i i guess i kind of miss that you know my dad uh yeah well our our the pets that i grew up with all either ran away or died a long time ago and my dad just recently got another dog and it ran away um-hum oh no but it was a real small dog and he's thinking of getting another one i don't know if he will or not but he wants to get another dog my mom uh-huh mom can go either way um-hum she doesn't really care too much as long as it's clean yeah well that's a big thing too at our house it was we couldn't let it in the house but the thing that i think my parents used it most for was to teach us responsibility um-hum you know it was our dog and we had to take care of it and if we didn't there was you know definite yeah yeah definite yeah i agree repercussion i think probably i'd be happier happier with just a ordinary mutt you know you get a dog that's uh show quality and you know you got to be real careful with it and yeah yep i agree i think i think a lot of times the mutts the best dogs anyway just because they're you know they really don't you know you care enough about them to to take care of them but not so much that you're worried about what you do with them um-hum yeah yeah where as if you're paying millions of dollars for it i think you'd be a little more concerned yeah that that you know i don't wanna get into a thing where you take him to shows and and you know all these papers and stuff and you got to be careful and all this and that uh-huh you know not that you wouldn't take care of it any less but that just something you know i don't want my boys to have to to get into that kind of thing yeah yeah well i agree i think it's it's a lot more fun when you don't have to worry about the cost of what you spent on it as much as just having it as a friend and sure basically a companion and that's it yeah exactly and that's you know it was really weird because although we fought a lot about it you know and who was gonna take care of it when we had it we really all missed it when it was gone um-hum um-hum and so i reckon i can agree with that well it was nice talking to y ou hey it's been my pleasure you have a great afternoon all right you too take care bye-bye thanks bye-bye  and all right well i mean short term i don't think anything's gonna be done about it well i or probably should be done about it uh are you saying you didn't think anything should be done in the short term uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention yeah well i i think that you're absolutely right there the other thing is is that we've got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh uh and that effectively adds to it whether it's officially on the books or not right exactly um and that's got to be paid exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come um i'm not really uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if they're talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the taxes taxes currently being paid then that can't it seems to me it can't possibly you know help with the the deficit picture it can only hurt the deficit picture yeah exactly um and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term yeah exactly so that that that's the current predicament yeah it seems seems like it's it's a kind of a catch twenty two i mean it's it's the um my understanding is what they're trying to what what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes they'll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue but it it seems like like uh it's sort of a uh a spiral an unending spiral and it it uh i'm i'm not sure that there's any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are are being recommended by by the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend and uh yeah i'm not sure how i feel about tagging them to share the cost of yeah the the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point it's partly a judgment of how bad the recession is yeah it uh it would seem to me that that there are other things that the administration could do well look first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates um-hum um-hum i think that's been a positive development i think what that's done is it's it's it's helped keep inflation from um-hum um uh well at the moment we're doing very well on inflation yeah exactly and it's a sort of a piece of luck that's the sort of upside to the deficit that's that's the upside to the recession yeah um i don't know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned sure depending on the world situation but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah they should've put a in the Reagan administrations took took took layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them for the middle class um-hum ah in the longer term ah we we we'd do well i think to make to make uh reductions there also somewhat related is to collect money that's owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second situation and i think certain entitlements i i'm inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to um uh a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools uh-huh which are so there not colleges but schools that teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition oh i see what you're i see what you're saying ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they don't provide very much education and uh and then the and then the people default on the loans yes well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh and i i i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but but but taking what you're saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely yeah  okay well you you start it well i feel that women have in the roles that they've played they've uh they used to be at home all the time with the children and now most of them work out of the home because it takes two incomes to make it uh-huh these days and um they just uh they there's more women than men now and they've learned that they have to take care of themselves that they can't depend on a man to support them now sure unfortunately what that's done is it's put everybody in a terrible position because it used to be that one person could work whether it a man or a woman that's right okay now we're in a situation where uh it or at least it seems that maybe it's the economy or maybe it's just uh you know employers taking advantage of the fact that women want to work and now that they've made it or at least seems that like two people have to work in order to uh in order to afford to live you know but uh i think it's it's great i mean my wife works uh makes end meet uh-huh well it's really too bad they and because the women are so underpaid and there're so many sole supporters that are women now yeah it's true it's true what they say like women get sixty seven cents to the dollar uh-huh that men make doing the same job that's that's terrible but i i think that'll change too well see in my days when i was a teenager my i wanted to go to school my mother said well she didn't want to send me to school i was going to get married anyway she said yeah so that meant that i was going to get married and a man was going to work and take care of me but you don't think that way now no that's why now every every woman i know works uh even my mother who didn't work for a while is back working now uh-huh um-hum um except with the few exceptions of people that are unemployed which is unfortunate lately um every woman i know works my wife took some time off after we had our uh child our first child um-hum but even that she's planned on getting work which good for her is she works in a profession that she could get work at home so she's going to oh well that's good that's really good so we don't have to do the yeah she's an editor so she gets to do that and my sister she's a what an editor oh an editor like in publishing yeah oh that's really good she can do that at home she could do that at home so that's good yeah i wish they could come up with more jobs for women to stay home with their younger children yeah i think that's the dilemma unfortunately unfortunately unfortunately my wife is in a profession that is uh relatively high amount of women in in publishing um-hum uh and it just so happens or maybe doesn't so happen that it's not a very high paying field now maybe that's because there's a lot of women in it like you're saying women are underpaid uh the amount of money that she was making didn't didn't make it worth her while to uh you know yeah well pay a babysitter and not be home pay for a babysitter or day care uh-huh um-hum uh you know say that and and on top of the fact that um-hum plus the clothing she has to have to wear sure sure that on top of the fact that that uh uh she can do some work at home that that it makes it makes it a perfect fit but well that may be a thing for the future the computers now that they're trying to stress that for women to yeah or to have so women can stay home and work on computers or or have day care at the work place one or the other um-hum uh but unfortunate it's like that's not doing too well i know a lot of lot of lot of times it's the opposite though a lot of times um men stay home and the women women go to work which i think is good if you're not breast feeding that's not i haven't found anybody like that i've heard of that but i haven't met anyone like that yeah no i i i've known a few people and i've read uh about others you know just like articles and stuff about other people doing it i certainly would do it uh i have no problem with that unfortunately i'm paid a lot more than my wife so it wouldn't be worth it yeah um for our family but i well how do you think women's roles are going to change in the future um well i think as as time as time goes on women will um definitely have a better better better role in the work place i think that you know the first wave of women in the work place in any substantial degree was in you know like in the seventies and eighties uh-huh and i think as women take on um roles of uh more importance in in jobs and and also again not to sounds i don't want to sound like you know like i like i think it's hard but i mean a lot of times women were given jobs because they were women you know and i think once once it evens out so that women get the jobs that they deserve and get the pay that they deserve which will often be uh-huh powerful positions where there will be less discrimination in hiring when they hopefully when they hire well see i in the past i could understand why men got paid more than women because they were the they called them the bread winners and they'd support the whole family you know yeah but that's but that's not the case now that's why not the case so i that's why i don't think that they should get paid more than the woman if they're sudden doing the same job why would it be fair earlier i mean you know  Lucille Hughes okay Lucille i'm Ron Ron Moore all right and what did and our topic okay our topic was did you hear our topic all right basketball i guess i'm probably a lot like you i'm a Dallas Maverick fan yes um-hum well i certainly am too now tell me what you expect from the Mavericks this year well unfortunately unfortunately i don't expect a great deal out of them they just have too many problems too many ailments too many hurt bones and maybe too much age at this point you know when Roy Tarpley just now he messed up on them it just hurt them so bad i feel like everyone else i feel sorry for Donald Carter and the owners of the team and the management of team and everyone else it just seems like um they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a a final a final team playing for for all of it national championship or the world championship and something like this happens yes yes sir ah well do you think it's time that we go for new uh coaches is that part of our problem yeah i think at this time we're just in a a rebuilding type of phase you know i think that probably would be evident with the more and more the more and more young guys they draft well it just it's it's it's so discouraging that they can't really i mean they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far i i'm awfully sorry that the Mavericks can't come on and and do Roy who's your next best team or who do you like after the Mavericks oh gosh i'm so much of a Magerick Maverick fan i don't know probably the Boston Celtics i've just always liked the Boston Celtics they have a they have a similar situation now that a lot of uh old guys on the team and but they're still playing good ball but i'm a i've always been a Boston Celtic fan too but well you know i've lived in Texas since seventy four so being a transplanted Texan in in the Dallas area i have to stick with those Dallas Mavericks we certainly need to support them do we not do you go to the game yes we do you know yes i go to a few games i haven't been to many i'm not a season ticket holder or anything i was a season ticket holder of the Cowboys for years and well when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school college and doing their own thing sort of gets boring going by yourself yes it does i'm sure it would it's such a monstrous place down there but um maybe next maybe they can do some i don't know who do they need to trade oh you bet well i don't know it seems like Rolando Blackman and and Harper sort of carry the team they just i don't know if i'm afraid to say that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good but and that can really help the team but they do that they trade the nucleus of their power right now yes sir it seems that way to me i course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have and i'm not well of versed on their capabilities but we really need to do something well you know i feel like uh the best they can hope for this year is probably ah an opportunity to make the play-offs i like their coach i really like Richie a lot and i just i think he deserves a good break he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club and i think Donald Carter the owner i think with all he's invested he deserves a a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with Roy Tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone i really yes sir and they have just done as much as they can for that man and he apparently can't straighten his act out so we need to to build on something more positive than that you bet i think they're fools if they ever bring him back oh i do too i certainly would agree to that hate to put it that way i just would not believe him anymore well it um i mean you can't give anyone too many chances and i think he has gone over the limit no there's an old saying you can lead you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink so and i think Tarpley's just a sad case but to be making ah a million dollars a year that's pretty sad that's right well it is tragic i don't um i mean we're gonna have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes i think oh i think you're right everything just been put out of perspective now you know you take a a young kid Roy Tarpley's age i'd say he was twenty one when he came into the league and and now he's probably an old age of uh twenty five or six uh it yes sir and making all that money well that's uh that's quite a that's a little more of a challenge for a young man than they they need at that point in their life i think i think you're right i believe that one so so so i think you know it's created by  hello Jim uh in Austin Texas oh one of my favorite towns i'm i'm in Houston in Houston uh yeah so we probably been having relatively similar weather yeah probably although i would imagine that i've had uh uh yeah uh although recently it's been fairly fairly humid uh some warmer weather and and more humidity than i think that's typically a little drier out there has it really yeah we yeah Austin is a uh actually i have my uh my brother and sister-in-law live in Austin and it is one of my favorite locations it's just i i think it's beautiful um-hum yeah it's nice today i i how long have you lived there uh i guess about a little less than five years now yeah practically a native we have lots of non native Texans yeah uh how hot does it get there in the summer time oh it it varies i mean occasionally it it it gets up over a hundred but it's not uh that's not really well i don't know i was going to say it wasn't not typical but i guess there is quite a phase this quite a period this summer that is was a hundred it stayed over a hundred uh it mid to high nineties it's it's fairly typical uh Houston doesn't get quite as hot actually because the humidity yeah yeah yeah that's correct i mean being i think being a little closer to the uh to the gulf we it has a moderating factor but again what we what we lack in the heat we make up for in the humidity i lived in Dallas for six years and the ocean the gulf yeah um-hum the humidity yeah uh-huh before uh i was transfered down to Houston in uh nineteen ninety and uh Dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i you know Houston can get just as uncomfortable right yeah well i but for some reason and and i guess it's uh not having just the extreme heat i mean we had uh one one year we had in in Dallas uh a week or more where it never got below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive yeah well i i'm originally from Kansas and and uh south west Kansas which is extremely dry and it's the opposite but but i mean that real serene heat yeah and uh and and and very cold in the winter uh but yeah the last summer that i lived there i guess it was the last summer yeah i believe so the last summer that i lived there it we had a streak of something like thirty eight days in a row over a hundred degrees uh it just absolutely sounds absurd and one day it it it actually hit one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade you know you know it makes you wonder how anyone ever lived before air conditioning oh i know i know well well that's uh uh how much snow did you get in Kansas oh well well that same year that's when that's when i finally left is that that same year we had this incredible cold spell and and i uh i uh oh i mean it was like uh you know thirty degrees below zero no yeah and and and i you know i had just bought a little MGB that i was going to fix up and you know sand it down and get it all fixed up and i and i had never bothered to check the antifreeze in it yeah oh no and uh you know here is this freezing day and i got my heaters up full blast trying to stay warm and and the uh uh and all of the sudden it dawns me i mean it's like one O clock in the morning oh i wonder if the car's got any antifreeze in it and of course it didn't uh oh no you know and so so i you know i tried to jump start it i couldn't get it in it still i mean had some it was slushing and uh i tried to start it i tried to jump start it i couldn't it didn't have a jumper cable ran to the store and by the time i got back it had frozen out yeah oh no ran back to the store got a can of sterno and you know was doing all kinds of stuff put blankets on the top of it i babied it all night it was fun did you did you uh keep it going it actually i mean the box froze but it didn't it didn't crack anything and i uh i left it for a couple of days and we called the tow truck and we hauled it over to a friend's garage put heaters on it yeah warmed it up and i didn't keep it much longer after that but but it it did uh yeah yeah and after that i decided i was going to go live some place where it was warm well i have never lived anywhere uh well the farthest north i've ever lived is Raleigh North Carolina which is certainly you know not your ice and snow country uh and it got you know reasonably cold up there in the in the winter time but i have never lived anywhere where i really had to battle snow and uh i don't think i want to yeah well it's kind you know i i finally decided that snow is kind of a neat thing to visit uh you know when you when you felt some ice cold all white white Christmas and some things like that it's a nice thing to go visit but it's not something that i want to live in day in and day out yeah i had some i had some friends who lived in uh New Hampshire for a couple of years and then they moved back south because they said you know it just prospect of every morning having to get out shovel the driveway to get out and then shovel the driveway to get back in the morning and shovel it again the next morning they said it just got to be too much well you actually get kind of get used to it after a while i mean and and and in the cold really it doesn't get at you that much because you you of course you learn how to dress well and the houses are well insulated and stuff yeah yeah i actually i i moved from there to New Orleans and and  you've done our most recent uh in series of projects i guess was inside was uh we remodeled the bathroom recently and how did it go well it went pretty well um other than the fact that we encountered some uh problems that you run across in older homes with uh plumbing which one thing led to another and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain which meant you need take the wall out and start all over jeez it's like starting over i guess oh it wasn't one of those it started out as a Sunday project and by the by the next Sunday it was done it wasn't a one-dayer uh-huh and it boy that sounds like uh course uh i don't know once you get it done then you probably won't have that problem again believe me yeah it's good for another thirty years um it you've got an older house yes they uh built a little bit more sturdy than well that's the thing that surprised me because once i got into the plumbing everything in there was copper and it was all soldered right oh is that right that's what drove me bananas because you know i'm going to the hardware store saying give me plastic pipe and and yes and cement and it's all been so to fit them together and nothing wanted to go so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over and just start at square one really huh that was an all day job just to get it plumbed well and then if you do it wrong fortunately i was very fortunate uh in the fact that uh when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on nothing leaked everything went all right everything worked and i just said that's marvelous i appreciate it that's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happen well i expected something to leak you know left a fitting loose or didn't use Teflon tape on one or something like that right yeah right but it all came together so i i felt pretty fortunate about that all worked out all right huh how about you well um ah probably the last thing i did was uh paint and wallpaper kids room um-hum and uh i learned uh i used the wrong kind of paint this wasn't must have not been a very good quality because it just hasn't stood up very well what kind of paint it was a latex plaint paint it was flat and i wonder if maybe i should've used the gloss um-hum uh but they say you uh use your gloss mainly in your kitchens and things like that yeah that and semigloss for trim work and usually flat for walls yeah but i think maybe uh i don't know if it was just the was it not washable paint well it it is a latex paint but it just kind of is so you know so it's supposed to wash you're supposed to be able to wash it um-hum but it um just looks dingy i don't know how else to explain it just it's pink what color is it pink okay it's kind of got uh oh just kind of a worn look to it i don't even even know how to say just didn't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked but did you uh require more than one can of paint we put two coats on it and it's a small room but i think it only took one uh can um-hum you didn't have to mix paint then right no okay we did uh oh you do mix the color as far as you start with uh white and then they add the color you know what i'm saying but um-hum yeah yeah but you only had one can of paint that you did the entire room with yes right and then i wallpapered a couple of walls and uh how'd that go well that was the first time i've ever wallpapered and uh that's a an education in itself kind of fun isn't it really but uh the dye lots uh must have been a little bit different from first of all it takes quite a few rolls even a small room if you're trying to match a design and i repeating patterns is what you have to check for when you when you buy your paper yes that's what i needed and i didn't think about that i got a Mickey Mouse print is what i got and so a lot is wasted yeah normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats so you'd know how i see i didn't even think to look for that and then the yeah one of them was just a different color different color pink is what it ended up being hm and i when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall no i didn't is that how you're supposed to do or did you start at the edge i started at one edge and went over then you had to cut around the closet um-hum and cut around a window um-hum but uh i've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall and i'll start with a plumb line and start right there and start in the middle of the wall and and go from there and go all the way around the room it seem to get it straighter is that the advantage or what's the well you you  okay we're ready to begin okay uh okay one of the things they said about how you feel about putting you an elderly person in a nursing home um yes i'd had that situation presented to me personally about three years ago when i had to put my place my dad in a nursing home and um okay he had Alzheimer's and he uh wandered and i had to put him in there for his own safety because i could not i couldn't care for him here any longer i tried as hard as i could is that pretty much a full time care situation isn't it yes and uh i had to work and he would get up in the middle of the night and he could get out and wander down the street and i was afraid for his safety um right and so i had to make that decision um did you did you um check into um a lot of different facilities and see what they care they offered yes i did i checked into the facilities uh the other thing that i did and i've recommended other people to do the same thing sometimes is to check and with people that have family members in that nursing facility you know see if you can find out who who has a family member there or if you go and check it stop and ask somebody when you see them you know do you have you know what relative do you have here um how is the care are you satisfied yeah um it took me quite a while to choose did you find there was a large range of costs involved in in nursing homes yes very much so there was a large range of costs uh and the cost didn't necessarily reflect the care yeah the cost some of the costs went for other amenities for those that were uh up and ambulatory like really nice dining rooms and you know uh things like that but that was for one segment but then the other segment that needed full nursing care i didn't feel i got the benefit of the extra cost is that what that's what i'm i'm thinking uh my mother right now is is able to care for herself and um-hum uh i was interested in looking uh for something that would have a a range of care i guess so that you know right and you would want the maybe the uh extra amenities you know like the very nice dining room and you know the freedom of the grounds to be nice so they can walk out there and you know activities you'd organized organized activities yeah yeah organized activities and things like that the uh ones that offer more uh uh care i i assumed that they have certain requirements for their uh nursing and medical staff uh some sort of requirements state requirements or right right yeah each state is different but uh here here in Texas there are certain you know requirements yeah is there um uh did you find there was a waiting list for some of them or to get into some of them yes there was a waiting list um okay in fact i had uh one when my i first started i went through a series of let's see i had my dad in two different nursing homes when i first started he was in one that wasn't total total patient care but where he could be watched but he had the freedom to wander around and and help caring caring for himself but he could do you know he could feed himself he could do things for himself um yes and i had him on a waiting list there then he got so that he could they could not handle him at that level and they didn't have a higher level at that facility which i really didn't think of yeah uh-huh you know when i checked him in uh so then i had to go and search i had to start all over again do you know whether or not uh some of the uh programs such as uh Medicaid a uh help fund any of of the costs involved in in elderly care uh Medicaid will under certain circumstances Medicare will again under you know have to be discharged from the hospital and for so many days uh Medicare will like i said under certain circumstances my dad did not was not eligible for Medicaid and Medicare would not cover Alzheimer's okay so there's there's uh some things they'll cover and some they won't so that yeah okay it almost goes by case by case yeah um that's uh that's something i think many people uh have to address at some point or other and and uh it it's a tough decision to make especially depending on your the care that is needed and and uh it is uh in in today's life more and more children really can't uh with working both couples working it gets almost impossible to do that at home anymore it it does and  okay Scott let's uh talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university and uh-huh do you have any do you have any kids or i have some yes some children i have three boys and they're all quite young and so we want to plan for their education we're we're saving right now and we're getting uh-huh um-hum bonds and and uh and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to how about yourself do you have any kids right no i'm in graduate i'm in graduate school right now so so i imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting your college your own college yeah yeah definitely in fact i'm even going uh selecting again for for my PhD it's it's a closed subject right now very good what uh what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to um well i use uh uh uh i have used uh several techniques depending on what for undergraduate i i you know my my criteria were much different than than like for graduate school um-hum um when i when i wanted to go to an undergraduate's institution i was looking for something that was you know rather small and easy to get around you know um-hum and what i would what i thought would be easy to get through yeah what what you thought huh yeah and and uh yeah my choice of graduate schools was uh you know it changed a whole lot i i got to where i i wanted to uh uh graduate with a little you know with a name behind me rather than uh just the degree itself yeah yeah so well that's a that's that's good because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work i wanted to get a school that was small enough that was personable that you didn't have a lecture with uh hall with about um-hum um-hum fifteen other students competing for the professor's attention yeah and uh but you i felt that i got a a pretty good uh undergraduate um where where did you go i went to Utah State University which is in Logan Utah okay uh-huh and the nice thing about it too is i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their business College of Business was accredited and well known at least there in the State of Utah and around the surrounding states and so forth uh-huh uh-huh and so i i felt like number one you need you also need to see what kind of name the like you mentioned before the name the college and university can can give you yeah and another thing that uh another reason why i chose that was the the finances i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it that i wouldn't get through four three years of of the undergraduate work and and have to leave uh-huh and uh so i did a lot of talking with friends with family with uh counselors at high school and also read some uh-huh some books on on the subject at the at the library uh-huh and uh it was kind of unusual because my my two older brothers and i all went to three three different universities depending upon what our choice was so right hopefully we we chose the one that was best for us and i i felt very comfortable and good about that so i um-hum do you do you worry do you worry any about uh uh you being able i mean do you uh obviously you've taken precautions you know or or measures to uh try and pay for your children's education but do you think that that's gonna be enough i don't think so i don't know the the way that tuition is increasing um no exponentially it's it's it's kind of hard to set aside money and have that money grow same pace that the college tuition is increasing i uh yeah yeah yeah i all i all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a at a nice heavy university and and that the your children can use the benefits of that university well that that's an excellent idea that's an excellent idea yeah yeah one thing that uh that we did uh and my parents and our family is that we weren't able to afford um the kind of education that we all desired so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades and that we apply and try for scholarships um-hum and uh scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education because my parents couldn't um-hum and what these scholarship could not supply i was able to to work for and and save and and and get also my my brother um yeah um-hum he's a he's a medical doctor right now he had to you know once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans and he's he's working to pay those off um-hum so i i think that the uh you know once you get past uh the initial stages of it that there's different options you can use and and uh the student loans are are a good option and yeah yeah that's what that's my biggest option right now yeah yes and and as you're well aware that tuition's not cheap  this is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is the first year um i purchased i mean i i was actually able to uh get some credit cards because i'm twenty one and i got it through school oh uh-huh uh and i i've kind of you know you kind of make a purchase and you and you forget you know what you put on your credit card and you know within a month you know they send you your bill and uh i i'm about three thousand dollars in debt right now oh dear it can add up in a hurry yeah they do i mean it's amazing it's like a an an illness or a sickness or something uh-huh well it's it's uh it's easy to use there's no doubt about them i've had i've had one for oh probably ten years now and if you can if you pay it off every month generally generally you're okay um our experience has been um we usually pay it off each month but around Christmas time um-hum we sometimes have to slide a month or a month or so to yeah Christmas time i can understand but what my after i got one i didn't just stop i got i've got about five yeah get caught up oh uh-huh they'll send you one about every time you turn around six six credit cards yeah and uh so i just charged a little on each and uh and you just get the um uh-huh the adding machine out and you add it up and it's it's amazing well you see these people that cut there's up say it's time to uh-huh we went to we went on vacation and uh and i charged a lot you know just well i charged um like clothes for the vacation and then on the vacation you know charged your hotel uh-huh yeah right and then you know when you got to eat you charge the rest i mean you know it's so convenient and oh and there's uh and you just don't i guess you know i'm just really stupid i just didn't realize yeah well i like them for a couple of aspects one is you don't have to carry a lot of cash with you um-hum and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you don't have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things it's convenient from that standpoint so it's it's nice from that standpoint from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are um-hum oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around sixteen to eighteen or higher um-hum yeah i have a friend that um she's married and her and her husband uh she said you know they tried really hard to pay them off and it took them three years before they were able to uh pay off their credit cards okay yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh um-hum well i think it started out with like a fifteen hundred dollar limit and i've had it for several years and i think i'm now up to uh seven thousand five hundred on it um-hum i mean i'm not course i don't always spend that much but that's what they'd let me spend if i wanted to um-hum i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and i want to hold that bait out i don't know if the card companies that you have usually around Christmas time they'll they'll send you a little group of checks um-hum say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and we'll charge it'll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more dollars um-hum um-hum so i think they're good but you've got to be careful yeah that'd be my overall summary i think it was hard for me because i wasn't working at the time and i was just going to school uh-huh and it was like every weekend i would just it's it was like sickness to me and i just got and just yeah spend uh but well i don't know everybody likes them at least for a couple of things they're they're handy they're nice on when you travel just yeah well what kind do you have um i have a Discover oh uh-huh and a Visa um-hum a Sears and i have like most of the department stores yeah well the Discover one is supposed to pay you back a little bit yeah have you experienced that or not i have um i have maxed that one what have you well that's uh i think that one's sponsored by Sears if i yeah it is and i got the Sears through the Discover before i had um and i didn't even know i went over my limit i mean that's i just didn't even add it up i don't know i'm just oh yeah i was just going crazy well and there's about fourteen hundred dollars on that card uh-huh well it can it doesn't take long i i just ordered a video camera yesterday and that's why that always bothers me a little bit to give your credit card number over the telephone but i um-hum i wouldn't do that i would not do that i've seen on TV and and there's too many scams yeah and there there can be there's no doubt about it we've  what what how do you get your main source of current events well until until recently i was taking the Wall Street Journal and i thought that was a good way but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things you know it's a week or two late but uh that's how i'm staying up i either watch the news or i or occasionally occasionally i'll read the paper uh do you like how it's presented on the news um no i think the media's a little bit too manipulative they allow you uh uh they they try to lead you too much i believe and and sometimes they're not very open i i don't know i think they're a little bit biased sometimes like for example the Kennedy uh the Kennedy rape case the the coverage on that was it it you know when it first happened it was he was guilty he was guilty he was guilty and you you you know they they they try to have you form opinions or whatever and and then i didn't i didn't like the things uh the things that were going on when we had Desert Storm and stuff like that you know basically i i i think they don't present the the whole sides of of everything so it it makes you feel like they're uh wanting you to take their opinion right uh it's it it's uh it's instead of reporting the news uh it's more like an editorial i believe on a lot of issues yeah i've noticed that too and it's kind of distressing isn't it yeah and they just i've noticed that they do it just with subtle little words uh usually uh just that sway the whole uh report that you know by just a couple of words well when i when i was in school i um i i was a communications major so i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm well aware of the little subtle words and persuasive speaking and and so forth so communications huh were you looking into becoming a reporter or i was and um um i went i ventured off in a whole entire different field field um i work with the state uh-huh and uh i um work with the Department of State Treasury in retirement disability uh calculate benefits i bet that's a interesting job yeah so the and so i and you know work is you know working for state government you you hear all about current events about about things going on within the state itself so that that's another source that i i i i where i keep up with current events and yeah there's one that i'm reading right now it's Information Week it says AT&T to account for the the benefits that the AICPA now says you have to show as a liability it's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninety three to account for that it's a lot of money and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more it's a lot of money yeah it is and yeah you have to stay up on stuff and i bet in your your job that you have to do you read the Wall Street Journal no well no i i i i i primarily deal with the state employees but i i find interesting tidbits in what the news reports as far as the like the state of uh uh North Carolina's budget and stuff like that and i i really know what the budget is and and and uh uh when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes and to pay people their income tax refunds and stuff like that and you know i'm well aware of the billions of assets the that the state has and it's it's it's it's just funny you you know so that's that's that's that's so i don't have a whole lot of faith in in you know the news of course it's they they get what they hear from but you know it's not always i i think one hundred percent reliable do you can can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective i think they need to do a little bit uh go into a little bit more depth uh and before they would just report like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that because i mean another example is the uh AIDS issue or whatever that you know someone said oh i found a cure they immediately the headlines on the news or whatever is so and so has found a cure for AIDS and then two months later it's discovered it's not you know it's uh before they before they come out with something like that they need to to research the the the matter i believe a little bit more i guess they do that so they don't get scooped you know so they have the big story well that that well yeah i i think i it i think the the  okay Howard what do you think of our space budget and should we go ahead and and keep exploring or should we call a halt to it is it doing any good i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country now i think what we made a major wrong turn we went into the uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now um-hum because they have not proven as reliable as they should have and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more um much better in many ways however um you know we've gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to Teflon to uh some new space age materials plastics and all that so i think it's been a good investment uh somebody was telling me the return was about twenty five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent oh really which is amazing for any governmental financed program i wish the post office just stop raising our rates um oh yes wish our post office could do that that's right i wish they'd just deliver stuff i think though that now that we're finally starting to get over the fears and the uh oh i don't know the guilt that we had out of uh Challenger i think maybe we can pick up and go on now but um-hum i i don't know i don't think we're really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives i agree the space station is where we should go i agree seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with at this point putting all these different things up there to monitor and you know and i'm in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things but i'd like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do see about setting a a space station up i'm all in favor of the space program and i don't think we should stop and i don't think we should cut the money well where do you think we ought to go with it um you talking about uh uh a a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there yeah i would like i'd like to see that i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and and see what's going on even if you know there's no life up there or anything you know but who knows and i would like to see them do something like that well you i i hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things and i think they i think they lose sight of of part of what they're supposed to be doing well i think about half the missions now are are military related are they not yes yes and uh i believe they are it seems like it's that high a percentage you know let's go back to our original thing with you know the right experiments and our uh you know our actual exploring of space and and all that and you know with with Russia uh seemingly not going to be as as big a threat well they can't afford to huh-uh you know and have you gone out to uh Fort Worth to see the space Soviet space exhibit no we were talking about that this weekend we it's only going to be there a couple more weeks we need to go um-hum um-hum we went uh we took our grandsons and went uh the weekend before last and it is marvelous i mean it's really neat how they they have done it they have done a beautiful job have they and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh all those things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship you know how they fall away from it and the loading and then and then it's actually you know the smoke comes out like it's taking off it is really interesting oh yes well maybe i need to run out there this weekend you really do it it's well worth the time and effort we went uh early on Sunday we got out there about uh ten ten thirty and beat now do you have to have tickets ahead excuse me no we bought tickets there and if you have children if you go to McDonald's you could they have coupons or did have now they may be through with them now that uh buy one adult and one child gets in free um i think both of both of my kids are too old for that oh okay oh okay you have teenagers or something yes well i had grandchildren so three of them so between their mother and their grandfather and i because their dad was at work and uh they're both uh yes yes but you but and the boys loved it you know they really did like it it's it's very impressive i'm sure uh-huh it is and i felt the uh six year old would you know that he'd be kind of bored but he wasn't even the three year old enjoyed it because they had one of those had one of those moon vehicles what um-hum and had it set up like it was on the moon and and showed it moving around and stuff so it was really neat well see now that's something else the uh Russians have had space stations manned stations space stations for years now you you know they had the MIRV um-hum um-hum and see we've yet to keep anyone up over over a week or ten days right well in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead  okay well you wanna tell me about the weather Lori i think we know about the weather had a lot of rain this year though that's right yeah that's true lot of records i think yeah i know it i just don't know what winter's gonna be like uh hasn't been bad so far no it hadn't but i mean we're due for a a big one here we hadn't had a big big winter in a long time well yeah i guess not well how about somewhere else you been somewhere else lately somewhere else where was i i was in Florida here recently and what was the weather like there great it was fantastic you wanna go back right yeah sure i wouldn't mind going back did it rain every day it usually rains every day there no it didn't really didn't they got maybe sprinkled maybe once i remember that's about it really huh uh-huh did you go to uh what is it Disney World no i was down there on business but we were right across the street from it oh oh really and you didn't get to go huh have you been there before no never went no never have oh my gosh have you been to the one in California my no my kids were the one to the one in uh out in California gosh we have to go it's just one of those things you have to see you know i know that's what i heard think we're straying off the weather though yeah that's true yeah hum boy we can't go very far with this subject i don't know i what kind of winter winter are we gonna have this year oh i don't know hopefully not too bad well bad enough so it kills all the fleas and bugs and whatever see we have to have our freeze for probably a week right but aside from that i hope it's still warm not too cold maybe maybe maybe well maybe a little snow on Christmas Eve or something would be nice but it doesn't look good yeah they were saying that the freeze last winter did you see i don't know if you saw on TV about the uh the migration uh not the migration but all the crickets that they had this year oh yeah did you see it they were saying they were saying that was caused from a very mild winter oh it was amazing that that the winter didn't that the winter did not kill all of the eggs like it normally does um-hum oh yeah but i was out i work out in Plano at a restaurant out there and they just uh i mean the my whole building was covered with them um-hum oh what restaurant is it i hope oh okay all right i work out in Plano too i was just wondering if it was near where i am but i mean it it was it was i couldn't i couldn't believe all of them yeah i remember going to work one day and just crunching on the stairs it was terrible oh it was unbelievable we couldn't see our parking we couldn't see our parking lot hey i'm not i'm not kidding we got pictures of it we could not see our parking lot that's pretty bad for a restaurant i guess probably doesn't help your business yeah it is well it didn't it well it didn't hurt it though that's the bad thing didn't hurt it they weren't on the inside they were just on the outside of the building just hanging around yeah huh well it's in here we started to get some in the house now i i wonder if it's because it's getting cool out and they want to come in yeah they want to they go towards the heat that's why that's why they were coming out of the ground when it first started getting cool they came out of the ground because it was warmer yeah yes and into the house yeah well yeah they like coming into the house but they were going crawling crawling up our building up into the eave where it was warm oh huh where the lights were and everything uh-huh huh but hopefully uh we'll have a nice hard winter and it'll kill them all this year because i don't wanna put up with that again yeah i know i know i mean it sounds cool to say but yeah it was pretty uh a bug's a bug who cares and i ended up spraying for them anyway after a while i think oh we spent a couple of thousand dollars on getting the getting the restaurant sprayed and everything yeah i bet you do huh you probably have to do that a lot of times during the year don't you oh yeah well we get we spray monthly just as just as a maintenance but uh i mean this was like every other day he was coming out there with his truck he normally doesn't spray with a truck oh oh hum uh-huh but he was having to come out there with a big truck and uh just douse the douse the grass and everything else wow yeah i guess you'd have to you don't want bugs in there that's for sure um oh i know it but i'm i'm ready for a little snow though got to have a little bit couple of days anyway maybe shut shut down shut down work but i doubt it maybe where i can stay home a few days and and play in the snow with the kids um-hum yeah it would be nice yeah that would be nice yeah i'm looking forward to it i don't know about anybody else hm yeah well as long as i don't have to drive in it oh i know that's that's the lousy part yeah i know and Texans don't know how to drive in it anyway oh well i'm not from here but yeah i never really did learn so yeah well i don't know what else we can talk about the weathe r well i don't um probably nothing yeah it's getting cool now i got a fire going so i'm enjoying it yeah oh sounds good well listen i enjoyed talking to you enjoyed talking to you too and uh i hope we get a better subject next time or or at least someone on the other side of the country so that you really can ask i i i know it well the maybe if they're listening to this maybe if they when they listen to this maybe they can set that up a little better yeah well it's probably just whoever is around or has the right hours on their sheet so they can call because it's getting hard to find people now yeah oh i know it that's true takes a long time and this was good i mean you were only the second one they called oh really but sometimes i've had to wait  well seems to me that part of the problem with public education may just be the wide disparity in what's being offered i don't know what you've experienced uh-huh um i agree i think that our education system needs revamped i and i think a lot of the ways they're going about it are not going to work i don't think just shoveling more money into the education system is the answer um i know that here they keep saying oh we need more money and more money and more money but i don't think i don't think that's the answer i think we need to take a different approach to how we go about it um are you familiar at all with the voucher system i've heard of it um i'm in favor of that i think that you know every parent i think if we were given so much money in a voucher and we're able to choose which schools to take our children to i think that would put competition between the schools and give the teachers some incentives to make you know to do a better job and the principals to have their schools being better and and i think it would put a lot of pressure that's needed on the education uh folks so that they would you know do better rather than just getting into their jobs and getting their tenure and not having to put forth a lot i don't know what do you think about that well part of the deal is uh in addition to the public schools there're all these other alternatives such as the private schools and the religious schools and the home schooling and uh-hum uh-huh some of these other options that uh that people are looking at but uh to ensure that everyone has a chance the public education system has got to do the job right right i know around here um the home school is an option the only the only private school i think there's probably one well there may be two private schools for the elementary age kids and they are you know down in Salt Lake so for me that's not really an option are there very many private schools there in Dallas well there're a number of them what happens is we have a number of school districts and those school districts that are considered quality people stay in those school districts that are not quality people who can afford them opt out and are going to the private schools or the schools that are sponsored by by the one of the religions oh uh-huh so see then that does put a little bit more um pressure on your public schools to perform what happens to those schools where nobody wants to go to well there's always people end up going to schools who can't afford to go anywhere else um-hum who will end up still going to that particular school oh and and can't opt out because they don't have the money to right go to private schools private schools here are very expensive oh uh-huh and how about the religious are they expensive or what i i don't know much about the religious schools about the only really religious schools around here are the ones operated by the Catholic Church but it seems uh-huh that the private schools uh get the greater share of people than the religious schools do oh huh does it what do you think about the salaries that our education um that that the teachers and and such make how are they down there do the teachers feel pretty good about them or are they well well you know salaries for teachers i think are low everywhere um most teachers never end up making much money no not if you're if you're good in an area and are not dedicated you can make far more money being in that area rather than teaching in that area do you have year around school no do you they don't uh they do in this area oh my children don't go to it but they were talking about starting it next year but there's quite a few schools around here that have the year around school um well they've been talking about that a few school districts are going to start experimenting with that but it hasn't really gotten going yet oh oh i'm i'm not sure i think that's the answer either do do a lot of the teachers there that teach during the the winter months then have summer jobs um as far as i know they're doing something else but i don't know uh-huh specifically you know what they are doing uh-huh of course if if it interrupted it here then it would mess up lots of sports and camps and other things that rely on that and you know long vacation period right yeah that's kind of the situation here because a lot of there's a lot of farming it's kind of a we live in a farming and a fruit you know area and and those the older kids at least when they get junior high and high school age are needed to to help out with those kind of jobs and so they don't do it with the junior high or the high school uh age kids it's just done on the elementary basis so far here but i don't know there's there's a lot of questions a lot of concerns i think our education system um is a good one i really do i think it it it's a  okay well there we are all right um um well uh tell me about the car that you've got well i have a Honda um hatchback nineteen eighty four and uh-huh and i had a hatchback a nineteen seventy eight version before this one uh-huh and uh i'll be honest with you i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and and uh put together and it it does its job all i have to do on my Honda is change the oil and the filter every thirty five hundred miles and i i did have to put two front two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles but that car just purrs like the day it was built i get forty two miles per gallon on the highway and right between twenty eight to thirty driving around in town it's a uh five speed straight stick machine um-hum and i can carry more in that uh that trunk area in my little Honda than i can in the big cars and i have a large um Pontiac and i have a sixty nine Cougar which really is i'm saving because it's it's old but it's in beautiful shape um-hum but i can carry as much in my Honda or more than i can in in those other bigger cars well that's very interesting i've had i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got it's a and surprisingly it's also an eighty four oh and um LX yeah i'm still there um i'm sorry what it was an LX yes it's an LX it's not a hatchback but it's um it's uh uh-huh yours is a four door four door yeah and very very comfortable car big roomy trunk uh and uh and very happy with it and i must admit it's you know if if if uh um-hum yeah yeah my only consideration were were you know buying another car just to tool around town and and make you know brief trips and things like that i i would very very seriously consider buying one uh i think they're extraordinarily reliable cars um my my real concern with with uh yes we are uh why i'm not sure i i want to buy a Honda is because i have to make a kind of a a steady um trip down the road about once a month because i'm divorced and i have a daughter that lives down in North Carolina and uh well hm i drive down interstate ninety five and it's just an absolutely wild highway ninety five is wild in any car there's no doubt about that yeah and because i i i run over to Crystal City or used to i'm retiring the end of this month uh-huh but i'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there and you well you've got it and uh so having precious cargo in the car with me as you can well imagine it's very hard for me to imagine that that uh a Honda's going to be as safe a car as as the one that i've got got my eye on which is a Volvo um-hum um-hum in in fact quite frankly i've owned a Volvo in the past and uh i've i've they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service but uh um-hum i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them uh course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that you know need to be taken care of and so forth and i guess that's one thing that that recommends the Honda to a lot of people is is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood and yes it just just sits there and purrs and you all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas oh i know it's really amazing yeah beautiful beautiful machine it's absolutely incredible so um yeah anyway i've been looking at the prices of these cars and and and so forth and i think that it's it's very surprising some of these very expensive Volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're willing to is that right uh-huh buy ones that are about the vintage of the the cars that you and i currently own um-hum and um well a brand new Volvo costs what thirty thousand dollars well certainly some of the top end ones you can still get get uh even the the low end wagons um for less than twenty thousand dollars uh-huh and uh we get you know in the Washington area of course being as affluent as it is there are lots and lots of Volvo dealerships down here um um-hum so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any any week and i sort of you know scan the paper and look at them and so forth and yeah so um anyway and that's that's the other thing is that i've i've never really been too terribly much of a new car person i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life and i've tended to um to uh buy cars that are you know two or three and sometimes even four and five or six years old this Honda that i have i bought used and in fact it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it i've just rolled seventy thousand miles and it's a seventy four i mean an eighty four so well my my eighty eighty four just has seventy seven on it yeah and i've made many trips to Washington and down to Virginia Beach Virginia where my mother lives and things like that and i drive it  being up up there maybe maybe you guys don't have as uh big a problem with air pollution as many do you we we we have a terrible air pollution problem do you really our summers are extremely uh hazardous and during ah certain um-hum wind directions because we get the uh Gary Indiana Chicago pollution um-hum um-hum and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze uh coming up along the lake that's horrible um-hum and they do post uh uh warnings for people who have uh heart diseases or respiratory problems um-hum during that summer season in the winter it's not as severe right but uh if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad uh-huh uh the state of Wisconsin as a matter of fact uh started some litigation against Illinois because of the air pollution we were getting uh-huh ah i don't think it's gonna go very far but it it was uh a way of ah triggering uh awareness right right so what's the conditions like in Dallas well uh in Dallas i i haven't seen air pollution quite on a quite on a level that we had in Denver uh i grew up in Denver and and i've lived there most of my life and we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days uh however in Colorado now they have the emissions control law which has really cut down probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post post warnings now you know as far as health concerns uh due to that emissions the the emissions uh um uh control on the vehicles seems that all of our all of our ah smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry Wisconsin has a a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag um-hum and they're tested for uh their pollution control equipment and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it's it is drivable hm so they've they've tried to do a lot of that and i you know uh there seem to be at at least in certain little pockets and we were talking earlier about Madison um-hum um-hum Madison has one of the nicest uh bike uh road uh sharing programs of of any city in Wisconsin oh really in all of Wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of uh bike trails for recreational use of any of the states uh-huh uh-huh and there is a a real promotion of of biking uh-huh but um there are still a lot of people who'll insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere right i find that a little irritating because i don't think it's always so necessary um-hum yeah yeah it it becomes it uh maybe to you and i who have grown up in some in some uh uh some more uh beautiful parts of the country uh i think that that uh we become a little more aware uh rather quickly of of what's happening with air pollution and how uh how horrible it really is um i i notice people in Dallas seem to say well sure there's air pollution but you know really how bad is how problem how bad could this problem really be um send send them to Wisconsin and we'll let them try to drink out of some of the lakes and try to fish in some of the lakes that have been suffering from oh really uh the uh acid rain and they'll they'll they may wake up you know how would you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour because of the acid rain uh-huh uh-huh um you right right it's a really a serious issue for those of us up in this ah sector up up here do you find that um or or do you hypothesize that that most of the uh smog or or air pollution comes from vehicles or does it come mostly from industry up there i think it's mostly vehicles although it does come from some of the industry of of the Gary area oh yeah um-hum and uh i don't know exactly where it emerges from when it it's up in the ah northern sectors of Wisconsin that causes the acid rain um-hum that i'm a little uncertain of but i do know that uh it is a problem um-hum um-hum i had talked with my parents i i grew up uh i was born in uh Muncie Indiana and and grew up a little bit in Terre Haute and i had asked them before uh i went back to visit recently about a year ago and i asked them i said did you ever realize the air pollution that was  what do you do to exercise well i um do aerobics and i have a tape and i play it just about every other day and i and it's twenty minutes of exercise which which who is it Denise is her name Denise Austin she's kind of off the wall person i guess but she's really good oh um-hum you do it at home uh-huh by yourself yes now what do you do i i i'm on the sixty eighth floor and i walk down stairs you walk down the stairs um-hum how many floors sixty eight how about do you walk up the stairs well my doctor told me to start walking up the stairs too i've got bad knees and he said it would it would uh do that i i i enjoy going down but this going up and i'm going up about fifteen flights now yeah yeah but uh yeah i i just started going up yeah well i worked in a building that was and i worked on the eighth eighth floor or tenth i can't remember anyway i walked up the stairs every day but like three times a day um-hum well that's really i think it's great for you and if you got to get there it's not so for me it's not so much of a chore well i don't think i could walk up sixty eight flights of stairs well they have that vertical marathon in uh i think it's in March where they do go up the stairs of this building that building is sixty eight floors oh no it's seventy one oh i didn't know that but we're on the sixty eighth floor gee and uh and so they have a vertical marathon they have a race and they have people that can walk go up sixty eight or what seventy one flights as quickly as i can go down them golly and and i go at a pretty good clip well do you do anything outside in the summertime going down i run i do a lot of races uh oh you know the and usually just the five K uh i hope to do the capital ten thousand this spring though um-hum i haven't done a ten K in a couple of years but um-hum but uh i like to run i just don't like being outside in the winter i don't like the wind yeah the cold and yeah i just well in the summer time i love to bicycle i love i take my bicycle to White Rock Lake i ride around the lake i love it oh i want to start riding around there i don't have a bicycle but but uh i i wouldn't mind that i have a bad i have a bad foot so whenever i i'm on my foot a lot it starts hurting me so i can't do much on my feet how would you do aerobics i do i make sure that my foot is flat on the floor when i bring it down um-hum i just can't do anything on my toes because i hurt my foot so i just i do the best i can that's kind of i just have to make sure that foot that heel is down flat that's why i don't do aerobics is it's too iffy for the knees um-hum um-hum and uh um-hum and i've got that's that's been my worse problem is the knee injury but i think that uh exercise i think everyone needs exercise oh yeah if i didn't if i didn't do this i uh we've got a woman in our office that weighs three hundred pounds you right right and she can't walk she can't do things that she can't do the things that you would just do not even think about doing like walk couple of blocks down the street to go to the store uh-huh we were going to go to the West End for lunch and she said no i can't walk that far oh it's three blocks i couldn't handle that yeah and i i have to keep my weight down because i feel so much better when i do i just i feel better knowing that i can do what i i can do what i want to do and not be um worn out or sore or you know i i don't want to run a marathon but right i just want to feel good yeah i just feel good whenever i exercise feel so much better i'm getting ready to go skiing yeah what are you doing to train for that just more aerobics yes that that's the major reason i'm walking up the stairs to go skiing uh-huh my doctor said you've really got to strengthen the quadriceps before you can then he told me to do squats uh-huh right now squat on the wall right right you know just sit he goes just sit back here and do this for a minute and i sat down and did it for about twenty seconds and said uh-huh yeah yeah that's what i've been doing but i'm not i haven't been too faithful i i've been working too much lately i've been doing those Christmas light tours at night so ooh i'm just i'm just kind of worn out i haven't had time to exercise like i should when are you going skiing next week after Christmas oh so i'm going to go anyway whether i'm up to it or not well  well let's see my husband does the majority of the um the uh gardening um taking care of the lawn and fertilizing but i um tend to all the planting the annuals and and the spraying and um taking care of them and maybe putting flowers in you know throughout that season and later on maybe planting some mums and that kind of stuff and um any kind of decorating for the holidays you know i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas but basically he does all the heavy stuff and i do all the fun stuff well we have it just opposite here my wife works in you know at at at the TI and she's uh sedentary all day long uh-huh so when she gets home she likes to mow i say and we have about ten acres and she tries to mow about half of it wow wow that's a a big job well yeah it keeps uh well it's doing real well because when we got this place the the dirt was just overgrazed um-hum i mean you know it was bare dirt in a lot of places um-hum and now you know since we've been mowing it and you know of course we water a little bit but that's just too much to water all at once but oh sure but just by keeping it mowed and getting it mulched in we've reclaimed a lot of it oh i bet it's beautiful yeah but we don't do much in the way of uh flowers we have one little flower garden that we that we work with the rest of it is just like wild flowers um-hum wild flowers and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers uh-huh they're about oh i guess a third the size of your palm of your hand um-hum oh that sounds lovely and of course in the spring we get the bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush uh-huh oh the wild flowers are beautiful i think um i was thinking about throwing some for in the back just where the kids um just way in the back behind the swing sets so that just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved yeah well my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing um-hum uh she enjoys mowing i can't believe it uh-huh i know a lot of uh-huh a lot of women do uh um i've just never really you know maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow but i mean i hate it my husband takes that and i'll help rake up the grass and um sometimes i'll help him edge um because we don't have that much property but we're on a corner lot so there's a lot of edging to do and um right yeah uh that's what's nice about living more in the country you don't have to worry about any of that we don't even have any concrete or asphalt oh oh that's nice i this is different for us because the other the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks and um it's been a little more country with the trees and we do miss that um if we had a chance to move i think we'd move back to somewhere that it was little more countrified and a little less maintenance required yeah but you know we do everything together this this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the actually this fall what am i talking about two weeks ago as as far as that goes um-hum wow we got a thousand pine trees from the you know soil and conservation people uh-huh and uh we're in the process of of planting wow that's a and we're building a stand uh just to the north and along the east uh property line um and i uh i think what we're what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break um-hum because i'll tell you in winter time when that wind when that wind comes out of the north it just cuts right through you like you're not even there right right so on the other side of the house though that's where we have all the the delicate flowers and the mums and we have morning glory and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers well i took um-hum and we planted those out by the septic so that uh they get plenty of water and we get hummingbirds come in the spring you know all summer long uh-huh oh oh that sounds so pretty and well when we leave the doors open they fly in the house oh really do they don't do any damage though they just fly right back out if you have the well yeah they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat i say and when you're as busy as one of those babies you got to eat most of the time i say and we've got a few you know we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders but um-hum you know for the most part gardening for us is well we got asparagus and uh we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato uh-huh and some blackberries and strawberries man we get the best strawberries that you just can't believe oh oh that sounds wonderful yeah we just got our last tomatoes oh i love home grown grown tomatoes there's nothing like them they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket yeah well these are accidental tomatoes what does that mean accidental tomatoes well last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes course you're gonna lose some that way uh-huh and the seeds go right through them i say and wherever they pooped  Alvin yes uh i guess i basically consider consider mykelf kind of conservative uh Republican how about you um i'm more of a liberal or at least uh in between moderate more of a Democrat huh okay uh uh what do you think about the Bush and the economy um the economy is is doing badly and Bush isn't looking good as a result i think i heard today that he finally admitted we are in a recession uh it's it's long time forthcoming for him to say that at well well the recession started a long time ago question is is when whether and when it's going to end or has it ended yet but it's the economy's certainly not healthy especially down here in Texas where we had a big a bunch of problem with real estate down here and savings and loans and if yes that's been one of the areas for for for problems in that we've had it more lightly in that respect but not without without uh without significant problems uh i think it's Perpetual Savings Bank went under here it's one of the biggest in the area yeah hell we've had so many changes of banks here in Texas that uh the names of them are no longer the same they got one called NCNB and we're supposed to think of it as NCNB and not North Carolina National Bank but oh oh that's part of the recent merger oh yeah it's merging with uh something else from the south and gonna be First Southern or First National or something i don't know anyway i think the solution in my opinion is to have something political to talk about is for the government to get out of business and leave us alone rather than get into business what's your feeling uh i'm not sure but what um what that's intended to to mean uh and uh regulations controls um as a whole i'd rather avoid government regulations and controls ah ah some are some are necessary and i mean in some ways what we're going through now is reaction to to all that developed during the eighties yeah look at the airlines they they were probably doing pretty well back in the sixties and seventies making a profit or least getting government support once they pulled out the controls look how many went under and say bye-bye yes that's certainly true i'm not sure whether it's bad or not um my sense is that ah that airline costs costs of flying are still are lower still lower today than they were before all this began um but we can maybe reach a point where there the number of participants in the field is too few and uh where where government oversight uh is needed and trucking industry when they pulled the plugs away from from that a lot of the safety that used to be in force disappeared the independent truckers will run on thin tires and they'll stretch the hours and they'll do without insurance and they and i think that when it was control there was better safety but i don't know if the accident ratios will prove that out or not i guess i don't know either but i there is a role for safety regulations likewise in airlines and i think for the most part though that that's uh continued for the airlines the safety record today is as good or better as it was in the seventies change of subject let's jump to Russia what's the feeling over there on the east coast about what's Russia doing and uh well i guess the feeling as much as i hear by is that uh Gorbachev is is is done for unfortunately oh unfortunately in a way at least everyone admires him uh but uh the future is with this this coalition this whatever it's called infinite um commonwealth uh with with Yeltsin yeah i wonder if Yeltsin knew how far it'd go when he climbed on top of that tank actually it's amazing if that one little soldier pulled the shit trigger and shot his head off i wonder what would've happened yes things would be different it would be it would've been a total different one little soldier probably nineteen year old boy decided whether Russia communism failed or made it well maybe i'm too far off in saying that well it would've it would've made a difference had there been violence ah the old regime still wouldn't have survived but it was it was to been bloodier than it's been through this point hey i wonder what happened to all that gold over there you heard that one haven't you the rumor is that much of it has been expended gone spent ah you said expended oh it's been spent then um they were rumors i i don't know what's happened i don't either uh i don't either ah wouldn't surprise me if some of the guys  Dallas so i'm in the Richardson area so oh okay yeah i'm out in uh north Dallas by the Galleria okay good all right well did you did you hear our topic oh capital punishment yeah uh right what do you what do you what do you feel about capital punishment well uh i'm all for it in certain situations and if it's uh you know i mean it just depends on how brutal you know the you know murderer you know just something like uh you know sure who'd they execute you for few years ago i guess it was the um Ted Bundy or whatever something like that you know serial killer you know same thing that happened with um the Dahmer guy up in Milwaukee it just depends um sure you know kind of an eye for an eye i think uh if they had more of it instead of you know some of these people been on death row for fourteen fifteen years be more of a deterrent all the people we're feeding and right and taking care of probably also for uh drug uh people um pushers and stuff people something like that you know it just depends i i mean sure you know i feel sort of the same way i i think somewhere in the Middle East in one of those countries if they catch you dealing in drugs they cut off your right hand right because that's the hand you use i guess to to wipe your butt after you do your job right you rape somebody i castrate you right then after they catch you doing dealing if they catch that same person dealing in drugs again then they whack they take off his arm so you know i bet they have a lot less problems with drug with drugs over there than we do here uh definitely but i don't know if you i mean it's it would never come to pass like out here i mean it's just that's i mean Middle East is no just uh the public's too sympathetic but yeah you know i don't know how old you are i'm i'm i'm fifty but i go back to where they were used to hijack a lot of planes and things like that you know i used to i had a good friend who was very vindictive but in attitude when he said you know uh-huh yeah best way to stop this is they catch a hijacker the very next day they stand him up in front of a wall and they shoot him um-hum and just watch how many after that happens two or three times as far as execution wise how many planes do you think will be hijacked and he's exactly right you know oh yeah you know he a hijacker gets put in jail and and Lord only knows what happens he doesn't get any kind of a death penalty as far as punishment or capital punishment and we feed him and clothe him and give him a probably let probably put a TV probably put a TV in his cell and everything else just to uh take care of him i guess uh probably living better in in jail than he would be if he was out on the streets or whatever you know because oh you bet bet so i believe in capital punishment and uh i definitely agree it's just you know you just have some politicians who never let something like that happen and i mean it's just oh i know i think our state state i think the state of Texas has capital punishment yeah they do yeah somebody just i mean you know uh and i think the i think the punishment should fit the crime or vice versa because you know a rapist goes out and for that guy to walk free if i mean he deserves to be executed as far as i'm concerned if they get the hard facts on him and he is guilty i mean you know this these people there's there's there's got to be a line drawn somewhere and uh not that i'm that hardened cold and cruel but there just appears do you know i listened listened to the Chief of Police of Richardson talk about four or five years ago do you know a man goes out and commits robbery not capital punishment and not capital crime but robbery he get and he gets caught and gets sentenced to say eight years seven to ten or something like that you know he gets five days credit for everyday he serves it's like a bonus for God's sake hm right right that's the damndest thing i ever heard of you get five days credit so if you if you uh get a sentence of five to seven as far as time served in one year you're eligible for parole exactly yeah there's that's ridiculous yeah there um i don't know i mean there's just so many there's just so many problems right now that i mean capital punishment is just icing on the cake it's just just at that point i mean the person whoever's done that you know killed someone has probably done that's got a uh police block that's probably a mile long you know that led up to something like that that yeah that's true i'm surprised there's not more vigilante cases you know i really am and there's probably a a lot more me know about because they're never they're never found out about but um-hum but um i totally agree it's just you know i God i'm sure some pray to God never happen that that never happens but somebody you know killed a friend of mine or something and you the first thing you'd wanna do is kill them you know but oh yeah well you know what if someone you've you just can't go out and you know shoot someone but you bet or what if you're my age and your your daughter was raped by someone you know who did it oh gosh you know that would be a tough time holding any father in his right mind down ah exactly i guess like a you don't like to think about things like that but it's right uh i'm in the uh the hunting type business so i sell firearms so it's different it's different for me because i know a lot of the product i sell goes for personal and you know in home protection uh-huh  all right well we'll go ahead and start with you and your opinion well um in and i think what it is in this country is that we have this uh despite all the complaints we have about government we essentially have a great deal of faith that despite uh any election things really aren't going to change dramatically uh-huh based on any given election and there really no one gets all excited over politics um over the the i mean you think of some countries where they've changed uh um you know it'll have a a coup or some ridiculous form of government there may change uh every few years like for an example would be the governments South American governments right but here it's it's very stable and i there's yeah nothing really to get all that excited over but maybe people should get a little excited and yeah and make some changes yeah i think i think that has a lot to do with it like you said you know unless there's something really controversial no one ever votes right right yeah people will vote presidential elections just um-hum um you know a local election that may have some great import but uh you know over all people don't have a whole lot to to worry about when it comes to politics yeah i think i think that has a lot to do with it that and they're just lazy kind of yeah they're that i for instance i haven't voted since i was eighteen just like i'm twenty two now and i don't live at i live out of the state that i'm registered to vote in and it's just and like you said unless there's something really important i just don't take the time yeah well that that's just it i'm i'm twenty four and i'm in the military uh-huh and uh i'm a um registered to vote in Pennsylvania and i only voted once it was in uh well the last presidential election uh-huh right you know and that was just because you know it's it's too much of a hassle to get the absentee ballot exactly or even to to drive back there which is what i did that time i actually went and visited my folks and voted the same time but uh uh-huh uh-huh yeah um in my position i well in addition to that and the local political scene i don't know enough about it anymore to even feel that my vote means anything right and for me i'm just afraid because i don't know the the candidates um right exactly i'm afraid i'd vote for somebody who i didn't even you know agree with right yeah just because i wanna vote or whatever right right but i i think um that's all things that that it's all my own laziness though yeah oh i agree that's probably same thing because first of all i should take the time to find out about the candidates i probably should talk to my mom and dad and who do live there and get the feeling for what uh for what they are you know have been doing and uh or for what what they feel the candidates are doing and uh um maybe do a little looking into it myself it's not like any of this is any big secret uh-huh but it's just a question of taking the time and it's they're yeah higher priorities right right you know i think it's really interesting too like with this the latest election in Louisiana where there was the guy who had been part of the Ku Klux Klan how much yeah how much interest that brought and how many people right David Duke yeah yeah that was interesting there was quite a few people in this area that had contributed to his campaign uh-huh and i'm in upstate New York and this is kind of a redneck area what the local newspapers um printed they somehow got a list of all of Duke's contributors oh really and they printed a list in the newspaper of everybody that gave money to that campaign oh my you wanna talk about getting getting even with them you know that was i thought that was beautiful that's justice right yeah well i think it's interesting how it takes something like that though what's that i think it's interesting how it takes something like that to get people on edge about ah politics yeah yeah oh yeah yeah you know people you think about having somebody uh somebody like that in power and the you know and that shocks them all but then um flip side of that is the same people go around um harboring their own racist racist practices and race race you know you ask those same people um how they treat uh-huh people and all that and you probably would not get a very favorable answer out of them right yeah i agree but the idea the merit the thought of somebody who publicly was a member of the Ku Klux Klan is pretty repulsive being in a position of power like that yeah right so well is there anything you think we can do to make it better or to uh what we can do to make it better right that that's hard because um i thought in the last or not not this last year's election but the one a year ago that they were gonna that there was gonna be some serious turn around of the incumbents and all that the people are finally fed up uh-huh  uh well uh to begin i guess uh space is uh real important i think so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time i guess so yeah i i i i agree it's it's definitely new frontier stuff uh so uh but uh i'm not too up to date on the space on the space frontier but uh but i guess they're going going pretty far into it now um Star Wars is not too far i don't think but uh yeah i i worked on some of it at TI once upon a time oh have you yeah so what do you know about it well actually i'm i i'm quite versed lately i get on a computer network all the time and people are talking about about the current space program all the time they're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that you know are just like science fiction you know it's like they take off you know and then they land with the with the you know the afterburners are going you know not like space shuttle landing you know gliding down but straight down to the landing pad really oh my gosh yeah it's called VCX or something like that also called Delta Clipper which is a decent name for something like that well well i don't know you think you'd you think you'd uh go up in space you had a chance oh yeah i think i would i think that'd be neat would you i think i would just just sitting here talking talking about it if the time came it'd be real nervous i'd be scared i think that'd be worse than yeah Six Flags roller coaster that'd be pretty hairy well you know i had a car uh uh a tire come off of a car so you know that's like i know what it's like to yeah imagine depending depending on what was left of my technology to get me home right right so uh well i guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff now or where ever yeah they're talking about doing that again too and opening up those stations or what ever filling them i don't know if we'll ever see that but um-hum well least uh have a space station supposedly in the next few years oh really yeah and they're gonna put that's all beyond my imagination really but science fiction books yeah i mean you look at the Jetsons you know a cartoon show and it's not too far fetched what what they all had in those cartoons so you never know oh yeah yeah and they had stuff on the Jetsons from that cartoon that you would never imagine would come become possible and now you we have lot of those so um-hum so you never know what what may occur but as far as me seeing it no yeah i don't know i don't know but i think it's real vital important for the future you know generations to come so um-hum yeah i i it's it's it's something definitely that uh yeah it's it's uh got the extra little oomph of interest yeah yeah i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too once it becomes you know like it's more possible yeah when they start showing the drawings and all that i'm sure you know when they yeah i wish uh like uh Boeing or or uh McDonald Douglas or something like that was supposed to buy a a space shuttle sooner or later right and just make it you know purely commercial uh-huh i'd go up you know and do things and you know so did they scratch those uh that Star Wars deal you know the one we was all worried about Russia and all that oh no it's still probably going but i don't know whether it it research will go on yeah but the economy the way it is all over them they probably cut back on oh yeah on that because it's not well they're they're gonna be cutting back so much on just you know the number of troops we've got in Europe and the number of troops we have here right yeah i know and then but uh Russia's still gonna have missiles they're still gonna be subs and things yeah and we don't know who's handling handling them now so that's a whole different story now yeah latest i heard it was just gonna be Russia that Russia itself that was gonna have them oh really at least that was you know that's what everybody says oh yeah yeah we want only Russia to have them uh-huh and now they say yeah yeah you're republic you don't want those you don't want those give them to mother Russia some crazy Hitler over there from one of those little republican republics or whatever they're splitting it all up now and one of them crazy crazy guys get a hold of you never know um-hum but that the guy that's taken over for Gorbachev he's supposed to be uh he's supposed to be on our side isn't he or pretty much one hopes yeah i think we went through him though to get to Gorbachev on a lot of subjects so um-hum but that way you can't never tell that yeah you know you know kiss some butt but but uh  all right so what was the last car repair that you had done on your car well we have two cars and on our little Honda we had to replace some CV joints and on our bigger car it's a Chevrolet we had to repair um-hum the control module the control module a mystery box huh uh yeah yeah yeah right so we've had just recently a couple of things the CV joints my husband just did himself and i'm glad he can do that because that saves us lots yeah that's that's impressive he's able to do a job like that because that requires special tools lots of money yes he does and he's lucky in that way too because his his dad lives real close and he has a lot of the tools oh that's interesting so so he's able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money that that's great what what kind of jobs would you folks repair refer refer to a garage um well we had to have the the Chevrolet had to be repair done by a repair man the you know the control module and even though that that still hasn't been taken of in fact we were driving along the other night and the engine light came back on but um-hum the man wouldn't the repair man when he fixed it said that it looks like um the computer panel or or the whatever it was needed to be replaced also and we didn't have it done at the time so it looks like we'll need to go back in and have that done wow so how about yourself well um the last thing that i had to have done to my car uh i wound up doing myself and um that was uh tuning it up oh and um i had been having a a problem where i would be driving along and and i would notice this at night when i'd be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my uh oh wow my headlights and uh then later on when you know i'd i'd get out wherever i was going i would smell uh something had been burning oh um-hum oh and i pretty much figured it was oil because i'd looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a Honda which i ironically have too uh-huh oh huh uh-huh you'd expect the car to be really clean inside right and it run real well real well and so anyway i i had been thinking about it for a long time and discovered that um uh or i had decided that what had happened is there's a a a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve train called the valve uh uh cover uh-huh uh-huh and uh i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the the whole cover itself hadn't been uh tightened down well or whatever and so oh when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore uh-huh and sure enough that's what the problem was my word huh and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there oh and on on older cars up to i i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but but on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like material and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material um-hum um-hum oh so uh oh so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now um and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold there's just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just can't even tell you the joy i get from that experience and uh-huh right right oh well that's what my husband says too he says when you have the right tools and a good place to do it in it's it's enjoyable and he really likes to be able to to do it but when you don't have the right tools you're out in the weather it's no fun at all sure and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity um-hum right right um but it's the the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and oh i've because yeah you can't afford to buy them so yeah exactly yeah yeah it's a sort of a catch twenty two if you're well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you um-hum right uh-huh so have you found um one certain type of car needs less repair work than another so well um have you had that many different cars or it's funny i've i've owned a lot of different cars i started out with Volkswagons and then um uh graduated to um a Honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a Volvo and then wound up with a Honda again um-hum hm oh and so i've i've had them all and and uh uh have gotten to know the engines in each one of these uh sorts of vehicles and but uh i in the Volkswagon business i i went from you know owning a bug to owning uh one of their cars called a Rabbit uh-huh oh yes uh-huh and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the Rabbit um but i i actually rebuilt a Volkswagon bug engine at one point and uh so i learned an awful lot about cars uh that way and oh oh boy i'll say i'll say well we i don't know we're a little bit partial our Honda we have got a hundred and  kind of younger still and we do a lot of activities with them how about your kids my children are in their late twenties and both are married and we do things as a family all together and when they were younger we were very involved in Little League and Scouts and band and football and things you know i have two sons things that you do together are are your sons are your sons still live in the area yes one lives in Plano and the other lives in Lewisville well with their wives i've got one son and one daughter and i think the activities haven't changed because my son is in Scouts and the orchestra and the choir and ballet and church activities and uh soccer and basketball and baseball and my daughter is on the swim team is in ballet uh takes piano lessons is in the Girl Scouts so tends to be very busy right well i my husband and i always felt that if you want to keep them off the street so to speak that if they're involved in a smaller group type things that um it really is wonderful as far as socializing and learning and just keeping out of trouble i work at a high school and i see a lot of kids who because it's a large school you're just sort are a little teeny fish in a big pond here and if you belong to you know a smaller group you you just have a better class of friends and and stuff and i think it's wonderful i i admire you it's a lot of time out Saturdays Sundays and nights but it it definitely is worth the the time to get your kids involved in in various things well gives gives them the opportunity to uh you know to relate to other people and not only to learn a specific skill and how to apply it but but more importantly how to you know work within the uh larger context oh yeah right the social life socialization is is worth whatever it is they're learning and it you know my kids never were on the championship teams they were both in the band they happened to have graduated from the school where i work and and um all those things were or have served them and still are you know in their adult years and in college uh you know that they just they remember lots of good times and um we'd still hear frequently from former teammates or band members or you know people who stop by and say hi to my husband and i and uh so are you active with i mean do you coach any of these things or oh yes i coached this year i've coached soccer i've coached baseball i'm a uh assistant scout master in the Scouts i've actually appeared on stage with them in their ballet performances and then a feel of things so it's a oh it's uh it's it's pretty active and my wife teaches piano and she's active with the Girl Scouts so well i'd it takes a tremendous amount of time it does and and um but as i say i i really feel to keep them away from the bad element at school or just at the mall or wherever uh every every hour pays off in the long run as far as uh keeping the kids from out of trouble and and uh and i see frequently see that here just because it's a high school and and uh you know kids kids get in trouble there's no well the ones in trouble the ones that are bored that's their biggest problem is boredom if they that's right that's right they're also you know have parents that either can't or don't care about their activities and don't support them and and uh over the years my kids have had friends like in the band that in in in three years of high school band their parents never saw a football game to watch them i think i i we never miss a game we still go and the last one graduated in nineteen eighty two so but we still you know go to watch these things and and uh well sure like last night we went to hear my son play in the uh orchestra then last week we heard him sing in the choir twice so you know we're and uh it's a lot of hours for a parents but as they a lot of hours either it be helping to run things or to just sit there and listen to things right right right but it it uh i recall my own parents being active in in my endeavors and uh you know i think you you you just can't spend enough time with kids in in quality time as i like to call it and and uh you know it's worth every every hour every so you have two children a boy and a girl how old are they well my son's eleven my daughter's ten okay well see mine are twenty seven and thirty so well i've got i've got a long way to go well start saving your money for college  where'd you go on your last vacation yes Hot Springs Arkansas oh and it's beautiful it was great in fact we purchased land up there uh-huh yeah it's it's well it's not really time share it's just a lot hey did you one of those time share things it's really pretty up there in a place called Hot Springs Village it's i've seen the flyers on that that please come up and we'll give you a free turkey and a tank of gas or something something it's it's really nice yeah something like that we got three nights and four days up there so we went it was a nice way to get away had a guy in Sunday school that went and uh some some place in Oklahoma and they gave him twenty four rib eye steaks oh what a deal i said well did you buy anything he said no we just went up and got our steaks i said well no that's the way to do it you know well their daughter was on a weekend trip with church and and they said that was the only child they had so they up and they went got steaks and got out of town for a while might might as well well now we'd we really liked Hot Springs just because we neither of us had ever been there and it was it's a pretty town kind of retirement village kind of it's full of i was gonna say it's full of retirees and full of nursing homes and funeral homes but it's still a beautiful area yes yes yes yeah well you you know you're a true Texan when you go to a funeral and there's more pickups rather than cars well i wasn't born in Texas but i moved here when i was six months so yeah i i consider myself almost a true Texan that's awful you you can qualify well my wife was born in Mississippi during World War Two but that only because of the they were called up for duty so well we went to uh Estes Park Colorado last summer ooh oh oh now that would be nice which is a uh YMCA uh camp and we rented a cabin and uh a kitchen cabin and and oh yeah that that's that's the kind of vacations i like to do and they got all kinds of activities on campus so you just kind of get on there and let the kids go run wild what is the what kind of a cost do they have uh with that let's see we had a two bedroom one bath a fully equipped kitchen i mean all you bring is your food they even got coffee grinders and all that stuff uh-huh um uh what did we pay uh by the time you get everything on there it was about twenty eight bucks a night you're kidding oh that'd be wonderful we got to get there first and no but you well you got to make reservations yeah you got to join the club that's seventy five bucks for two years first then you go through the drawing and uh yeah it it it's you got to oh okay real expensive here hm there's more to it than that but but it's really nice and uh yeah and it's just through the local through the YMCA uh no you can if you're a member of the local YMCA you don't have to join the club up there oh okay they they they somehow will accept that but you got to kick into the Y system to get out oh well yeah because we're in the the Garland Y but it it's a lovely place to go if you got kids even if you don't but so that would come in well yeah we have a two year old and a four year old well they've got things planned for that age group but it's all extra everything is extra once you get there well yeah the Colorado Colorado being a resort place i can kind of understand that but that's i love mountains when i went to Utah one time and i was just in heaven as i say it we got off the plane at the Air Force base and i was just yeah we saw the bighorn sheep come down ooh well they're Rocky Estes Park is right next to Rocky Mountain National Park um-hum um-hum we tried four times and the last time before we came back they were crossing the road and going up the path they're ugly um oh oh we saw also saw a real big moose two moose came out of the hills into downtown Estes Park and were eating grass in a vacant lot this isn't little and you're going we're like in civilization here we're not out in the country oh how funny we were on a trolley anyway so you enjoyed Hot Springs has gambling casino gambling come to Hot Springs yet oh um no but they do have hay horse races at the Oaklawn tracks and bingo i bet you i bet i don't know about that but i'm sure they do with with the age group that's there i'm sure i would imagine they do but i know they have horse tracks that's why and they weren't running while we were there in September but they were doing simulcasts with Louisiana Downs oh so they you can if you want to bet and that did draw a big crowd you could bet there year around legally oh are where are the are um-hum yeah no uh at the tracks they they they run i am you can bet in Dallas the year around well yeah but legally they the horses run there from like February to April so we're planning to be back the middle of February was like i wanna go back but it's it's in the mountains and i really like mountains i keep my husband had never been outside of Texas until he and i got married yeah huh and it was like let's go to Florida let's you know let's go to Florida and because we had a friends over there and that's a pretty area too we've been to Orlando a couple of times not to go to Disney World but just to go and do other stuff that's there if you like cabin cooking your own Robber's Cave State Park in Oklahoma is a neat deal oh i love it what is where is it Robber's Cave State Park oh it's in Oklahoma about six hours from here yeah but see i'm a i i'm a Texan i i have a problem with Oklahoma well this is true Robber's Cave State Park i know i know we don't have mountains in Texas though and they got cabins and kitchen cabins and yeah see that's my parents go to they have i guess i got the buying land bug from them they've got a piece of property out on uh Lake of the Pines planned activities  well tell me about your home okay uh right now we're living in uh well it's me uh my wife and uh two young boys and uh right now we're in a uh i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home uh-huh which you might call it so we don't have a a big yard uh but uh when my wife and i first moved in it was just the two of us so it was enough um-hum uh and it's uh i guess what they call a story and a half because it's not a full two story yeah where you know everything on top is on bottom so it's got real high ceilings on half the house and the other half is just standard sized ceilings hm and uh it's it's about a five year old house now it sounds nice it's uh pretty nice unfortunately unfortunately the builder who built it went out of business already oh yeah yeah it was a Landmark is the one who built it yeah well you know these guys that gambled high lost big you know yeah that's true and uh exactly what happened to them i'm insulating myself from that problem i'm building my own house oh that's nice and as i look out the window of my trailer i can envision all the insulation that's going up today oh really are you doing it yourself yeah yeah i i used to be a builder wow oh that's nice and i retired about five years ago oh i see and started college oh and now i'm uh a college educated builder yeah there's still no work you know so uh you know i decided this summer that uh you know we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials so i did that's great and uh see the the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home really is that so i didn't know that you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house but you can't borrow the money to build your own that sounds kind of dumb well it's to protect the the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home and then it doesn't sell and then the bank's holding the bag hm yeah yeah well hm as as you know anything that involves the government is works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right hence the savings and loan problem we have today that's right yeah that's true but uh you know my home is uh fairly simple it's designed to be added on to um-hum that's good yeah well i figure it's just me and my wife but you know i like to do stuff with my hands and what not so i'm gonna have a shop yeah yeah how big a lot do you got it on ten acres wow that's nice that's real nice well yes it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor he's on the other side of a hill oh and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon seriously God that's pretty good and well in summer in the winter time i can see see another guy but you know he's um-hum you know i can just make out his place you know yeah i got a thirty mile view to the east and about ten mile to the north yeah and uh oh that's pretty good uh yeah well i took a lot of time in choosing this site uh-huh because the the house has no heating or air conditioning oh you you you don't plan on putting any any of that in well it's got a a very small furnace and a uh i'm use a wood burning stove as well but uh-huh yeah in the house itself i've been working inside you know these low these many months and i have not had to use the heat um-hum wow because it's all geothermal yeah that's pretty good and with all the see i've got on the south side is all glass well as much as i could get in it you know yeah and uh the east side is glass i've got uh one two three four five six windows in the east side on forty eight feet so it's almost all glass wow and uh my wife would love that oh yeah i mean you know she loves lots of windows there's no place in the house where you can stand and not see four windows that's great so uh is it a single story well not really it's uh it's on the side of a hill oh i see so the first you know the the the what i call residential level at the side that's in the hill is about four feet deep um-hum um i see and the side that's on the uh the other side is about six feet high oh so i got a pretty good grade there and then when i put the verandas which which will be twelve feet out all all the way around on the north south and east sides that will define the shop yeah um-hum yeah that's kind of like uh like a Victorian style so exactly yeah yeah i i've always liked that the you know i we don't have much yard but i built a small deck in the back but you know i i see th ese magazines where you know do your self your own decks um-hum um-hum i i kind of wish i had them the size property and and uh one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck when yeah  you go ahead and start or i will whichever you prefer okay um well i the thing i like to do the most is swim and i was doing that real regularly but i am expecting right now and sick and uh so i have kind of slowed down a little bit but anyway that's the thing that i've found works the best for me is is just doing lap swimming well me i play i love playing basketball and volleyball oh do you i do and i play well i played a lot until i hurt my shoulders this summer playing volleyball and they haven't come back to full swing yet so i haven't been able to play as much as i would have liked to but oh did you play in high school no in Texas they don't have um they don't have volleyball i played basketball but not on the school team oh uh-huh just played a lot recreational i didn't have i worked so so i didn't really have time but oh yeah it's i love actually athletics is really for me it's a great thing to do i do it one to keep in shape and two just to to not stress it's my release of tension oh well i know my husband likes to do that he plays racquetball too yeah uh-huh he still does some oh does he he's he's played it since i guess he was in college and then um he plays uh two or three times a week so he's a member of the Sports Mall in Salt Lake and he'll go on his noon hour and uh-huh he still likes to do that so that i know that that's one thing that he likes to do and i think that relieves stress too that's awesome yeah do you guys mostly just exercise to release stress or to relax or oh well i think i do it for uh weight reasons i mean you know to uh-huh so you don't gain weight but and also i i know i feel a lot better when i do yeah but i like i said i have just been really sick and and just can't i'm just almost too tired i i was going um in the mornings um-hum and that well i tell you having a kid is rough isn't it what from what i hear having a kid is rough well yeah we we have also have an eleven month old and a six year old and and so it's just kind of oh my um it's finding the time for me to exercise is another thing but i really do like to do it uh-huh but well great anyway you're a brave woman to do all that oh jeez well the the kids kind of keep me exercising too that's true there just chasing after them i guess yeah so you do you have much time to do that since you're in college now um i make time really if i if i don't make time my study habits or actually i don't my studying doesn't go as well i can't concentrate and so and so it just kind of helps to work it in there huh yeah and really it's if i don't if i do it i i feel like i get a lot more accomplished in a day than if i don't huh well and so it's it's for me it just is worthwhile to find time to even if for half an hour just to get out and run yeah i think that's probably true with anything when you work some exercise in it just seems like things seem to go more smoothly i don't know yeah that should be a part of i guess everybody's daily things i tend to agree i think it makes it a lot better for the person as well as as for a couple if you're married or if you're anything like that it just helps to i don't know to have something to do oh i know my husband wants me to take up golf that's another thing he does and uh you know i don't know that i see that as a real big exercise though yeah i don't know i've i've been a few times but that's something i am really bad i mean you know it takes me a million strokes to get it in so that's right that's me too and i'm supposed to be good at it so oh so you do golf huh i do no i try i'll put it that way i'm not very good i i uh-huh i enjoy it just because again it gets me out it gets me away from every all the stresses of school and work and oh yeah well do you ski i do uh-huh that's something i really enjoy i especially now that the snow's good this year oh been a few times and really enjoyed it it's it's amazing how each exercise works on a different part of your body i never realized you know i thought basketball basically covered it all but after i skied a few times i've just been dead have you oh yeah you felt some muscles that you oh i haven't been skiing for years uh-huh oh really huh-uh uh not downhill we do have cross country skies and uh-huh and i i enjoy that but i don't know downhill i was always real bad at that too and it's just the thoughts of it kind of scare me i was one of these out of control uh-huh skiers but well it's kind of how i did it too you you what that's kind of how i did it too oh oh well so are you have just are you just starting out at school no i'm about three fourths through oh are you i have another year year and a half until i graduate so oh huh hopefully we'll make it through i'm getting married in May so we're trying to get through school as quick a s we can oh you are well that's exciting congratulations yeah well thank you it's it's fun it gives me more motive to to exercise as well yeah well good anyway we'd better cut this off before they scream at us but well yeah it's nice to talk to you and it's been my pleasure good luck in everything well thanks you have a great day all right okay you too bye-bye thanks bye-bye  i'm sorry um hobbies let me see i don't know if that took or not i'll do it again that's okay i didn't hear okay okay okay what are your hobbies i hear you have kids right that's your full time uh hobby right you you heard her in the background that's babies takes a lot of time huh i like uh most sports i like to do that i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing um-hum oh little bit of embroidery work once in a while what do you like to do um-hum um i try to do some painting although i'm not very good at it um well i'm sure you probably are i well no not really you like it that's the main point right yeah i i have you know i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative but not the ones that give me the ability to be so i always try that's right i i do some sewing mostly out of necessity um i'm making drapes for my house just because i'm oh boy that's hard sewing yeah well it isn't and it is it is you know actually the sewing isn't the hard part it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it because you need so much room measure it and get it uh well if it it depends on how elaborate you get it if you get pleats and all kinds of things yeah i've been doing that and that yeah that but usually i have to do the pleats by hand so that at least i can do it you know watching TV or whatever but that's a lot of work oh right right yeah and i've i've gone and you know put the needle through my thumb a few times trying to get it through but that feels really good yeah so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything but i i need to do it you do it right i have let's see i have a dog and a lot of fish keeping fish i guess is my biggest hobby and keeping fish well they're probably easier than keeping dogs though aren't they um yes and no it depends on and how frequently they die and how much that bothers you oh no how much that bothers you and you probably have to clean out the tank uh that's you don't do as much as as i thought in fact my problem i had fish as a kid and they always died oh no i mean immediately and what i'm what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean oh you're kidding because they need to have a little bit of the because you have right you need to let the bacteria build up and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance i say and i would just take everything out and just like you know wash it with scalding hot water and and it would kill all the bacteria and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again so oh no and so you'd have to start all over to build that up probably right that's right so now all i i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing and i don't try and sterilize things right right don't go through the whole nine yards and that's right they kind of need a little bit of that that's right so you've had fish for a long time well i've had them i guess it's been two years now i've had a a tank here and and then back at home i used to have a small you know five gallon tank but that never worked well and what size do you have there i have fifty five gallons now it's a lot easier oh that's good size have you ever had it to crack or break or leak i was just playing you fifty five gallons you'd hope it would never do that no no not yet that's right i really do but you know what do you have all kinds of different fish or yeah i just have you know what they call community fish you know guppies and platies and and basic things i don't get into the expensive right right the expensive ones um-hum real exotic huh well they're probably hardy to harder to take care of and they are and they're very expensive and you know when you die it's like it when when they die it's more like an investment you've lost an investment so yes i bet it is do you have problems with them uh your fish eating each other no not really only if there's baby fish you always have to isolate those right then you have to how do you isolate them you get um a jars something or well no they have uh breeders it's a little plastic thing that sort of floats okay okay and you put the mother fish in there and then it's got like a trough underneath her so as the babies come out they fall down the trough and there's a hole in the middle so they fall onto the bottom part of the chamber so the mother can't get to them either okay oh and that's you know it it kind of works but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate and on occasion if you get a real small one it'll fit out the slots right they will go through the slot that's right so but you know it works i guess that works all right they they don't uh want want the mothers to be with the little fishies yeah oh they'll eat them yeah they will isn't that odd you wouldn't think that that yes it and it's funny because the one i have every single month without fail she has babies you're kidding and oh no all all the time and um i've and she's supposed to her variety it says they won't eat the babies and i've seen her do it uh-huh that just makes you sick almost doesn't it so oh it's terrible well i mean it makes you understand that you know things are different you know we might right we might decide what's proper and what isn't but you know that's the way it is for them yeah things are different in the animal kingdom huh yeah that's kind of the way they do it yeah that's it survival of the fittest or something yeah because if the baby's strong enough it can swim away fast enough and go hide right go hide from them well and then you think well how do they do it out in the real world anyway so yeah yeah when these little fish are in the tropicals or wherever they are yeah yeah kind of trying to keep up with that but if you're like me you never have enough time for the hobbies huh no not really i i try i also i also i play a couple of instruments  uh it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year but uh it's it's camping really when was the last time you went the last time i went camping was about uh in the middle of October and we went up to Lake Bonham and really enjoyed it had a real good time with the family we do an awful lot of camping how about yourself well i haven't been in probably about three years and the last time we went was in um well i guess it was it was like hunting season and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake Lake Sam Rayburn uh-huh uh-huh yes oh which is in East Texas very good i bet it's pretty over there it is real pretty um let's see do you do a lot of fishing and what do you think what kind of camping uh are you talking about do you go out and is camping for you in a motor home or a trailer or do you actually put up a tent the whole bit one of the ones that you pull along and then pop up is it pop up oh okay so you have yeah pop up a pop up trailer huh how fun we have a tent yeah what do you have a tent yes so i guess we really rough it really and we really enjoy that uh one thing uh i've done all sorts of camping i've i've camped uh in the snow on a glacier i've camped uh basically almost anywhere even to a point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that that camping trip and had to pack it back out so you're a serious camper well we enjoy it yeah but since i've been married and with a family uh we have to go where there's restrooms and playgrounds and so forth so well that makes sense we really enjoy it but also while i was growing up we did have a trailer and uh i've camped in in a trailer and in a tent and in in log cabins and so forth too so a lot of different things and yes i to answer your questions earlier yes i we do enjoy fishing and i do go fishing haven't done a whole lot down here we recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in uh northern Utah down to here because of work and uh haven't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there which which is uh clear water fishing and streams and and rivers uh but when y'all went camping is that what you normally i mean what did you normally do we normally yeah we did we did a lot of fishing but mainly what we did is we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see uh in the area i guess probably just where ever you live at then has a lot to do with where what you're gonna do when you go and you do actually camp oh yes that's true that's true and did you ever like travel around to what's that the little KO KOA KOA camps whenever you ever done that no we never did that they although i've stayed in KOA campgrounds uh we've never done that just to go around and camp um personally i when i when we were growing up and when we were uh going camping i thought that was little too structured of a camp ground yeah um you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or or had trailers or so and so on and so forth where you know we really wanted to go camping in a tent and uh KOA is is is geared for the people that have a hook up um hum they actually travel from what city to city state to state right exactly and uh i started out basically camping when i was when i was in Boy Scouts and we did an awful lot of that as as a Boy Scout group as i mentioned earlier we went into wilderness areas and we camped in the snow in in uh snow caves and that's probably where i first started was in Girl Scouts and uh all right and you got a lot of that in huh yeah what do you like to do when you go camping um well let's see i just i mean i just like to go and normally normally i go with a whole group of friends and we just kind of go and hang out and um-hum just do fun stuff roast marshmallows enjoy it huh tell scaries or scary stories around the fire and and so on yeah or um take a deck of cards if we if we can actually see and um play cards and stuff oh yeah you know that uh lot a lot of people i've talked to have said well isn't camping boring don't you get well don't you uh get bored and not have anything to do but i've found out that actually we we really enjoy getting away from the television the telephone yeah it's relaxing and yes exactly get out getting out and enjoying nature and each each other's uh company when we're out camping plus you um kind of makes you appreciate some lot of the things you take for granted yeah like like running water your hair dryer curling iron running water and a and a private bathroom and yes well what about your family do your kids and everything like to yes they really do they have a great time and like i mentioned uh the we've we've been been camping a couple of times this year and the last time was in October and we went up to Lake Bonham and there is a playground for them and so they have swings and they have slides  where you calling from i'm in Dallas also okay well we're pretty close then i've never talked to anyone who's not from Dallas yet have well you know i've been pretty lucky i've called sometimes eight o'clock in the morning before i go to my office and i've i've talked to a lady in Utah i talked to a man in New York and i talked to uh yes a lady in Kansas or somewhere obviously i'm not calling often enough so anyway our topic was movies i can handle that one yeah i can i'm a movie buff i can too i'm a a junk movie watcher so but i see them all i see the junk ones by myself and i see the good ones with my wife i go see all the shoot them up bang bangs yes all the uh strong R rated and my wife and i go see the the My Girls and the good ones well i'm ready if you are what kind movies you like um oh you pressed one already i'm sorry okay um yes i'm sorry course i like most everything i'm quite fond of horror movies and science fiction uh-huh oh are you okay so am i um what about you well i sort of well like i like them all but i'm a you know i'm an Arnold Schwarzenegger fan a Sylvester Stallone fan and i like detective type uh mystery dramatic types we saw did you have you all have you seen Cape Fear no but it's on my list of things to see i haven't as a matter of fact i haven't seen whole lot in the last month or so but did you like it have you okay yes that's tremendous that'll that'll be equivalent to uh Silence of the Lambs or something like that oh did you i assume you saw that one yes i really enjoyed it i'd read the book and i thought they stayed very faithful yes that was great they did yes yes it was a great movie did you see the original Cape Fear before you went to see the new version no i didn't no i missed that one i thought i might rent that um that might be a neat idea uh well i'll tell you something that we just saw recently that is old old but i'd never seen was Fantasia yeah bet that was good it was not what i expected it to be oh no it's a tremendous movie it was but i mean i can understand that little kids wouldn't find it um particularly appealing it'd be way over their heads i think right yeah i've seen it two or three times it's such a a great movie and the music is wonderful yes they uh everyone my wife's a teacher and all of her teacher friends are saying we need to go see Beauty and the Beast they say that's quite a nice movie i wouldn't mind seeing that well actually we kind of like going to see things like Bambi and such too so Beauty and the Beast would be okay with me right you bet we seen them all you see i'm such a movie buff i go out i'm self-employed so a lot of times i'll just uh i just have a two person office myself and my secretary and i'll just uh go out for lunch at noon sometimes go to a movie and come back at two that kind of a thing so how often a week do you go oh i probably average at least one and a half to two times a week yeah see you're pretty you're pretty movie buffy i'd do that if i could oh i enjoy it yeah i enjoy it a lot of times uh my wife will have to stayed after school till seven and i'll just uh leave the office at five and go to a movie and come home at seven and i'll be here when she gets here have you seen the new Star Trek no i'm a will see that though that one and Hook looks like uh it would be good Hook does look like it'll be good and let's see what else is out new this year that uh my wife and i saw My Girl and that was a good little uh that was a good little movie it's supposed to be cute i heard it got pretty good reviews yeah it was cute um i was we were a little disappointed with Home Alone which we just saw we kind of catch them sometimes when they come around on videos sure you bet and uh i don't know maybe we just weren't in the mood but yeah that was a little that was a little slapstick you know yes but uh My Girl will sort of it'll bring a little tear to your eyes or something it was cute movie kind of well that's all right a lot of them do oh i understand we uh yeah we see quite a few our daughter and uh son are moviegoers and future son-in-law they're all moviegoers so we've we just all go to movies it's good entertainment especially if you go you know before the uh when the bargain matinees are oh i think so too absolutely that's what my wife and i do on Fridays you know we uh meet at five thirty and uh go to the movie and then go out and go to dinner somewhere then come home uh-huh well particularly if you see something that isn't very good you hate having wasted your seven dollars each or whatever it's up to you bet well it's expensive to go to a movie i'll tell you well it is particularly when you buy popcorn and everything oh i know because we take uh so my wife and i take my son and her intended to the movie you're talking uh between tickets and popcorn and everything probably forty bucks i'm sure i'm sure because we go we go visit them Lubbock Texas that's where they're at going to school and there's nothing to do in Lubbock Texas but go to the movie and you better do it before nine o'clock you know oh that's the last show huh right but anyway we uh yeah we really enjoy it but trying think of another good movie i've seen lately uh oh i don't know i missed  well my view i work for a financial institution and oh boy yeah and i love my credit card uh you end up with more consumer rights by using credit cards than what do you mean by that uh what i mean is say you pay for something with a check your check clears you're out the bucks um-hum you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you can't take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your Visa charged back oh what's your favorite credit card do you use Visa how come get your money back Visa well that's the kind we offer oh that's a good reason that's a good reason and uh we're just offering a a new card that gives you one up to one percent back of all the charges that you make now cash back you know like Discover's i was gonna say i know Discover does that yep and we're starting to do that Visa's gonna do it too we are who all right who puts out your Visa card uh we do America First Credit Union who is we America First Credit Union and you're gonna offer the cash back just like Discover does huh well i i'll tell you that works because i use my Discover card more than any other credit card for that sole reason yeah did you get much back hm yeah unfortunately i use my Discover card more than i ought to not a great deal i get i get about a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the year usually well good for you that must mean and it's one percent so you spend about five thousand i shouldn't tell that to you that's pretty good well i i do better than that everything goes on mine and then i've got a business too that i use it for charging computers on well i tell you then then i have an exact account of everything i've bought it's all printed out it is nice yep and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what you've spent and if you know when you bought something because often i won't remember and i can go back you know i'll remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything well how many cards have you got well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my uh-huh uh-huh a debit card yes i don't like those yeah and so i don't either because it's gone although they don't debit it until the end of the month yeah oh really that's interesting um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like my my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i don't get that bill till the end of the month and it's not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months uh-huh with a debit card no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back oh credit oh okay i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month yes because the the cost to use it is terrific is it twenty percent interest uh it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty one percent wow and that's that's tremendous amount our card's thirteen and a half oh you're kidding me uh with a ten dollar annual fee how do you get one of yours well you have to be a member of our credit union and what credit union is that America First it's we're the oh but see you're in Utah yeah yeah and you'd have to be a resident of the state oh okay i was thinking about your brother he said Jack and he'll do that but that's you're nowhere near us wow that's a neat idea though perhaps some other people around here will catch on and do it too uh do you have Mervyn's and all those have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards oh yeah oh yeah they have for years but you can still use the three big ones MasterCard Visa and now Discover you can still use those three um at almost any department store what do you think of Discover uh Sears not taking anyone but theirs they have not done that for years yeah do you like that or do you think that's fair or i don't know i used when i was a a kid i worked for Sears oh and it i'm just i'm so used to them not taking anybody but theirs they'll take Discover but see they back Discover too so it doesn't bother me because i use Discover most of the time yeah yeah it's theirs ah okay let's see do you think that uh the move towards plastic is a good thing i think i  how the Mavericks doing oh so-so so-so yeah they're not doing too good this year they're they they think they kind of started off with a rocket there at the beginning not in the season but i mean just when uh just in general uh-huh right just kind of come down to an even slump but they're not doing too good this year story with Tarpley is he uh is he history altogether oh yeah oh yeah that's kind of in a oh tough situation they're handling yeah i'm kind of surprised that they uh that they that they hung onto him as long as they did really they they gave him every chance possible with him oh they gave him more than more than uh more than i would have is that right oh yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't have put up with it after the second time i'd have said get out of here uh-huh uh he's talented player but uh i feel i don't know they seem to get involved in those substance abuse problems and it's a tough road for them oh i know it you follow follow the Mavericks well you know because i follow the Jazz fairly closely and then you know we're in the same conference yeah and you know keep tabs on them a little bit how's the Jazz doing this year they're doing well i uh are they they're in the in the head of the division and just won the last two road games they beat uh Philadelphia tonight it was a close one beat them by two points or three points but yeah they're doing they're doing great uh they had this little incident i don't know if you heard about it with uh Carl well that's good Carl Malone and Isaiah Thomas huh-uh there was a i guess they played last Friday here in Salt Lake and about the first two minutes of the game Isaiah drove in and Malone went up to block the shot and really fouled him hard so hard that it put him to the floor and he had like twenty stitches above his eye whoa and uh they in reviewing the tapes decided it was a flagrant foul oh i guess they decided it was flagrant foul at the time of the ball game and ejected Carl and then he got a he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game suspension which is about another thirty five thousand no kidding so it was a forty five thousand dollar deal for him and i i believe it was unintentional he fouled him hard but it wasn't like he had you know malicious intent to go cream the guy so there's been a big buzz about that how how Detroit's the bad boys of the league to begin with and when something like that happens to one of their players they're all all claiming that uh my goodness you know it was totally uncalled for this unnecessary violence when they've been guilty of that kind of thing for years right Laimbeer and Rodman are about the two worst hatchet men in the league so yeah that's for sure anyway yeah i didn't even hear i didn't even hear but i haven't picked up a paper probably or a sports page in i venture to say in about a month oh is that right yeah i haven't had a chance to so you've you've been busy huh yeah just been extremely busy but no i didn't i didn't even hear about that i didn't even see it on the news so i must have missed that one altogether well yeah it it was probably more local interest obviously but no something something like that they usually they'll usually you know play that just about anywhere yeah and everybody's interested in seeing the little well it's just the nature of the human i guess to like to see a little violence i think oh especially excessive violence where somebody gets hurt especially oh it's just so but we're raised we're raised on that yeah yeah everybody's raised on that that's true on the negatives of life i guess yeah well i've had about enough of Magic Johnson for the year though oh yeah i guess where he's uh appears he's touring with the team and Jabbar's thinking of coming out of retirement to help fund the AIDS research and i don't know you hear both those stories yeah i heard those i guess that's a nice gesture on Jabbar's part yeah might as well yeah it's going to take a lot of people to do that though it's going to take a lot of research what do you what do you think about that do you do you think that he got what he deserved or you mean as far as Magic yeah well i mean you know he he got to pay to pay to play as they say yeah yeah but he's he's paying pretty hard yeah i did see it circumstances but well that yeah that's true i guess i guess maybe we'll you know some good come of it because of this you know it's a notoriety and focus that it'll have on the disease yeah that's true he definitely he definitely opened it up and showed a different side of it yeah i don't know how the Lakers are going to do without him this year they they're doing all right now from what i see but i don't think they'll hold together yeah he's uh the was the heart and soul of that group so no i believe you're right i believe you're right anyway what other teams you follow any no that's about it i i i just really i mean when it gets down to the end end of the season if the Mavericks are doing good i'll stay up with them but yeah i i'm dedicated to a point uh-huh yeah you know just like i'm more dedicated in football i guess than anything well the Cowboys are a lot more popular aren't they well yeah well i was raised on the Cowboys so uh-huh i mean the Mavericks are well i i was raised with the old Dallas Chaparrals oh is that right yeah that was years ago though uh-huh that was that was uh i guess the original pro team that that they had here yeah well  well do you do you have uh some strong feelings one way or the other about about the care of the elderly well yes i do um this is a a question that hit pretty close to home uh i had to go through this with my dad about four years ago he was his health was failing um-hum and uh he was adamant about two things one was that i take care of my mother and two that he not be put into a home um-hum and we talked about some length and i respected his wishes he uh stayed at home as long as he could and then uh he died in a hospital but um um-hum i think that my position was is that uh you you need to find one that you can really have confidence that they are taking care of the of their uh of their clients yeah and um because i've heard about the many abuses and because he had heard of so many abuses he just didn't want that yeah yeah how about you well my graduate work is in speech pathology and uh so so uh i've thought about this more than once uh you know dealing with uh you know i'm concerned we're gonna have a geriatric uh population in in twenty years it's gonna be you know phenomenal yeah almost thirty all all over thirty percent isn't it yeah yeah yeah uh and um but i have been amazed and and in talking with uh some of my fellow students it looks as though um nursing homes are not going to be the only option anymore and uh in twenty years uh where a lot of students are hoping uh to work as an in the home type uh uh approach approach where where the uh where there's the speech you know the speech therapist or whether it's a nursing uh specialist or someone plans to uh work out of a family's home and take the responsibility away from the family but yet allow the the loved one to stay you know at home with the family members uh um-hum it it's it's difficult for many families especially in the case of uh of of Alzheimer's and and uh some of the more degenerative diseases to uh say uh uh leave them to to have them at home because then the family becomes completely uh they're captives exactly yeah and and did did you experience that with your with your father or not uh we had a at one stage we had care somewhat like like what you're talking about we had the Visiting Nurses Program um-hum and they sent somebody in and it it was a a nominal charge that this uh it started out the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day yeah they would try to get him to exercise they would try to uh you know they would check him over temperature you know the basic checks try to get him to talk and be motivated and uh that's what we went through uh-huh uh up to a points things seemed to be working and then i i think he he became discouraged right and they did not know how to take care of that and then um at that point i think it mostly a psychological problem uh-huh oh and uh but yes i agree there's a lot of options there could be a lot of options uh-huh i think it's time that uh we decide to do something about it yeah um definitely you know uh one of the other subjects on the on the switchboard and this is one that i've that i've been thinking applies here uh where where uh young ones young kids uh graduating from high school whether they should do a community service type work this would be an excellent example of somewhere uh someplace where um the community could be more involved you know more than just leaving it only to professionals there is a lot the communiky the community can do to uh enhance the or or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home i suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need possibly before i don't know now yeah the church or synagogue whatever because typically these were close-knit groups at one time but in today's large metropolitan areas or even uh-huh in most even even the rural areas now people are not quite as close as they once were hum-um uh the mobility factor the factor that uh oh we're living longer and people are less trusting all these things tend to destroy this type of system but i agree with you it it might be some possibilities there although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do oh i agree that's a that's a good point i think they would have to have some training some  well uh down here in we've got um trials by uh jury in criminal cases and the sentencing can be done by the jury normally although the judge can sometimes do it how do y'all do it up there um we usually do it uh the jury comes to the verdict and then the judge does the sentencing um i think the jury can recommend something but in you know in some cases like uh murder in the first degree but i the ultimate decision is the is the decision of the judge once the verdict has been reached the jury's dismissed and there's a separate hearing for sentencing we've got a lot of these uh in federal court they have a uniform sentencing guidelines that pretty well leave it up to the uh judge to assess the punishment in a certain range um-hum well i think it's curious that the sentences that are handed down are usually not served i think that's a big problem with the criminal justice system but right here in the Dallas area if you are sentenced to ten years or less to incarceration in in the uh penitentiary you will never make it to the penitentiary and you'll serve about a year in the county jail and then be released because of the jail overcrowding yeah well i i understand the jail overcrowding issue but i i think in in in that case as as as in so many all they ever do is discuss the problems and they never do anything to solve them i think that's why this country's in the shape it's in now but i i don't really believe that a jury should do the sentencing i think well the judge has a better idea of what is probable ranges for that particular type of offense where a jury is just doing it for one time yeah i just don't believe that jurors have the the knowledge the scope and the knowledge to to handle the sentencing whereas the judge does well you know in in civil cases they can have uh as few as ten of the jurors agree on a verdict but criminal normally requires unanimous they might make a change on that and that might make for fewer mistrials that's that's certainly true i just i i mean i don't agree with juries doing the sentencing but i do agree with trial trial by jury i just think that's critical course in civil cases trial by jury doesn't necessarily work if you have a big complex uh business type case where a jury could get totally lost in a lot of those cases people decide to just try the case before a judge and just not have a jury right well i think that can that makes sense too because it looks like it would be awfully hard to pick jurors that could follow something as in in a civil case i mean that was really complicated and had a lot of technical issues in it but they there are a lot of criminal cases a lot of murder cases and that that are really very complicated and they seem to be able to get through those and you had up there North Carolina that case of that lady who poisoning her various husbands what was it Blanchard or Blanche Taylor Moore Blanche yes yeah we've we've been reading about that yeah we uh have you have you heard about trial that we've got going on now with the uh the man that's accused of molesting twenty three children at a day care center no i don't remember reading about that well that's the uh that's probably one of the biggest child malestation cases in the in the nation's history this man and his wife it it's a trial by jury but it's really going real ragged i don't understand how they're doing it and they got they he had a hundred and seventy eight charges against him and his attorney's managed to get it reduced to ninety three but the jury in that case they've just absolutely sequestered them nobody even unless you were paying attention at the very beginning you don't even know their names and they uh uh from what i've been reading in the paper they are the ones who are gonna do the sentencing in that we've got a case going here where a man is accused of poisoning his wife with arsenic now and the jury the case went to the jury today and the jury's deliberating right now arsenic is uh this this Blanche Taylor Moore woman was very clever she did it very slowly over a large period a long period of time at least it was it was done very slowly over a large period of time and since the jury has found her guilty now the judge did the sentencing in that and she's appealing but i'm assuming that she's guilty because i really believe in the jury system well the collective wisdom of the jury usually prevails yeah hopefully they're smart enough not to be hoodwinked by illegal ploys by lawyers and prosecutors  okay i don't know what kind of music you like but i went to the Neil Diamond concert Tuesday night oh i would've liked that oh it was wonderful oh i bet it was huh it was really good really good music and it wasn't too loud and he was on a round stage so every seat in the arena was good well um um was it a lot of his old songs yes he did sing some of his old songs and his new songs and uh-huh and he has a wonderful band he has like a ten or twelve piece band sounds like an orchestra oh does he oh huh i would've really liked that yeah it's really good and he had a laser beam show with it you know the the lights shined up to ceiling and like laser beams and oh did he then he had that dry ice that oh uh-huh that makes it look like he's standing in the clouds and oh well i have seen him before but yeah it's been years ago oh have you oh see i hadn't seen him before it's been years ago i saw him in Las Vegas once yeah a long long time ago but um yeah we just we went to a Kenny Loggin's concert oh he's a country singer right well he's he's rock but um yeah he is really more rock than country that it's oh is he rock i know i've a lot of the singers you uh you i hear the songs and i say oh yes i know that song but it's hard to remember their names and uh-huh um the name sounds familiar i'm sure if i heard some of his music i would know well he he sings Footloose from the the movie do you you know Footloose that song oh i see okay okay yeah yeah he sang that and yeah but um and that was good it was loud though it was in a real small theater in Salt Lake and it was very loud oh yeah yeah when i went to see Alabama it with the music was so loud the whole building trembled and oh you couldn't talk to the next person sitting next to you you'd yell at them scream at them and they still wouldn't hear you it was that loud oh yeah oh i don't enjoy it that loud they put on a good concert but it was just too loud uh-huh huh well do you like the instrumentalists like have you ever ever heard Fresh Aire or um well Mannheim Steamroller oh i'm just not up on that stuff oh uh-huh they're well they're it's all they're instrumental and um i love instrumentals yeah but they're real good they i know they were here in Salt Lake we didn't make it they they're here this December but we didn't make it to that oh yeah yeah uh i i tend to like the more mellow my husband likes uh harder loud but yeah yeah me too i'm an older person i like the more toned down things i well i'm starting to sound like my mom me too i remember her telling us oh turn that off i can't stand that and i'm kind of i'm like that with my husband now turn that down yeah me too my mother's uh-huh yeah that's the way my kids my mother she'd say oh that's making me nervous turn that down or turn that off uh-huh oh yeah uh i don't even know what uh i i have younger kids and so i don't know they talk about these groups nowadays and i don't even know who they're talking about oh yeah that's the way my kids did when they were growing up are your kids all grown oh yeah uh-huh they're grown have their own families now uh-huh um yeah and they were teenagers i i didn't know what music music they were talking about the groups yeah well i know they talk about um all these rappers now do you like the rap uh-huh sometimes yeah some of it's kind of fun but well it's just different oh oh well have you seen any others or uh-huh uh-huh no i haven't i was just really i felt really lucky to go see Neil Diamond the other night my cousin gave me a free ticket to go as a Christmas gift so uh-huh oh that's nice so i felt really lucky to go see him uh-huh oh did you go to cousin then huh did you go with your cousin then no she gave me her ticket oh oh she decided not to go so she gave me her ticket and i went with her friend uh-huh oh her girlfriend so it was nice i got a T-shirt oh well good oh did you oh i'm not they said they ran small so i bought a large and i i put it on last night and it i wore it to bed like a nightshirt yes but i think it'll shrink up because it's cotton oh it's quite quite big huh quite large huh oh well yeah oh they do usually huh well i'm trying to think what else we've we did go to a current Christmas concert um uh-huh oh did you it's uh he he's uh a local musician it's Micheal Ballum is his name and and he's kind of almost um sings opera almost and and he um  well i tell you what uh my my uh notion of camping is uh uh well i haven't been very far out see i've been in the uh hill country that's about as far as i've gone as far as camping so i haven't done any really really rough rugged camping but uh yeah to me it's the uh pitching a tent and i mean we we're talking real roughing it no cabin no johns nothing just being out there in the woods yeah that's it exactly no uh i don't Boy Scout huh yeah do you do you backpack car camp no actually the only camping i ever did was was when i was a scout and uh as much as i would like to you know to do it i you know don't really have the time right now but i've got two young boys and i'm waiting for them to get a little bit older then we'll start doing some camping my son's twelve and he's in the Boy Scout and he went on his first backpack five miles i've gone with him on uh some other things where we oh great we kind of called it car camping where the car is you know a hundred feet away or something um-hum but i did not go on the backpack i'm uh my back wouldn't allow me to carry that so oh i see he got the backpack in and carried the whole thing and do it the Boy Scout way and he came back tired and wore out but what i didn't my scouting was not as involved as i'd want i got the star and that was it um-hum yeah but i'm hoping he'll go all the way his troop is very active and there's about as many dads involved as going out camping and canoeing as there are boys so that's great yeah that's great it's an important part are you involved in Indian Guides or Indian Princess with your children no not yet but i'll tell you i i know i was when i was smaller i started out Indian Guides and then went into Cub Cub for a very short time um-hum and then we kind of i kind of got away from it for a while and then uh when i got back into it again i was ready for for Boy Scouts and i joined joined the Scouts but i tell you i i sure uh recommend it for any any any young boy girl too i mean i i really enjoyed my time in the Scouts does we've done rent a tent in Arkansas once where it was a state park and they have very nice manicured uh-huh well paved park and beautiful uh uh bathrooms within walking distance and you rent a site and they rent a tent that's and you put your tent well one tent's already up um-hum um-hum and that's not very rough at all you have electricity and running running water right there but uh yeah i think for a family outing it's good uh but you know if you're with a bunch of uh preteen and and young teenagers who really want to rough it yeah i i'd recommend going the old backpack method you mentioned the word rough my idea of rough my wife's idea of roughing it is if the town only has one Holiday Inn to choose from and she just feels like she's being imposed upon yeah uh i kind of at my age i kind of like the car car car uh camping yeah i can understand that uh uh my sister and her husband uh their children are out of college by gosh they're already into this uh well car camping plus they will leave the car a few miles away um-hum yeah and uh but they're they're they're enjoying that so uh we've gone cabin camping in Colorado yeah um-hum uh where there's a uh you you uh have all the conveniences but you camp in the cabin and that's not camping at all in your opinion uh-huh yeah well i hope you find more places to go camping yeah i'm really looking forward to it you know i i really did enjoy my experience and i i'm hoping my boys'll enjoy it as much as i did have you checked checked into the State Park system no not yet but i tell you i i know my wife she hasn't she really wasn't uh well her family they used to go camping quite a bit when she was younger then as she got older they kind of stopped going and and she's expressed interest in going and doing some camping so sleeping on the ground that whole bit huh but probably yeah probably not that rough we're probably talking probably tents screened in shelters work her up to screened in shelters that's a good place to start from in a yeah a cot and then slowly break her in i don't think my wife would even consider going to a tent camp again at all it's just yeah with cots with with cots yeah and one time we did go that thing uh there we came back from an event and turned the lights on around the camp site and there's a skunk right um-hum oh no and without thinking i picked up a stick and threw it at it as it as it was starting to voluntarily walk away why i didn't let it but i threw a stick at it uh-oh it turned around and if a skunk give you a dirty look it did and i said i done made a mistake i said please skunk go on and he looked looked at me a little bit more then wandered on off very very slowly as my wife and children headed for the nearest tent to uh people we'd go down to the coast every now and then and we've noticed some people camp out on the beach on public beaches and uh yeah really i didn't know you can do that uh public beaches State of Texas beaches not where it's city owned property oh oh not like Corpus  say Arlington Texas now since i got somebody from Arlington Virginia one day yeah is that right yeah well i never thought about that but there is an Arlington like i i had a card the other day from Birmingham Michigan oh Birmingham uh you know and i was thinking yeah and i was thinking the only Birmingham i could think of was Alabama right it's funny how many names have been used uh all over the country yeah well tell me what kind of books have you read but uh well to tell you the truth i've been going to college for the last four years so mainly text books i was gonna say not fun kind right no um but i i really tend to like biographies a lot not necessarily always heavy ones but you know sometimes biographies i just read one about Grace Kelly i i love to read about uh-huh real people to me half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories yeah it is because you know that it's really and truly a the true thing you know i read one about Bob Hope that i liked yeah it happened it happened really yeah that was real good i'm like you if it's not a heavy biography you know i enjoy it right i used to like to read about royalty a lot i read when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived i think in Europe that was my thing for a while i'm trying to think uh i read a uh a novel that used the names of like Princess Di and Prince Phillip coming over here to be entertained and all and there was a murder yeah it was sometime ago seems like it was The Spy Went Dancing or something like that uh oh really oh it sounds like fun it was a lot of fun because they used these real names you know wonder if it was by one of those famous writers you know Margaret Truman Daniels writes a lot those yes in fact i believe it was because uh-huh i believe it really sounds like something she would write yeah i think it was by her that you mention it because uh someone had given it to me and i thought well this will be great and it was yeah i've heard heard that she's done real you know her books are really interesting and they always sell well um-hum well when you use real people like that i think you know and royalty especially you know and uh yeah brings it to life i know uh the British some of the British people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty yeah but you know that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth you know i know our movie stars our movie stars because it's totally different concept to us oh right but i haven't i haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either i have read uh mostly novels i went to visit my daughter in Florida and i took a novel with me oh um and read it at Thanksgiving time and um it was uh one of those generation novels you know starts out when they're small and continues through generations and i like that you know oh yes oh i always like those have you ever read anything by Susan Howatch yes i have isn't she fabulous oh she is wonderful oh once you start i don't like to get one of her books because i i just live to read i'll i'll skip everything just to get back to the book i stayed up one night i think till two in the morning finishing one of hers because i start i could not put it down oh yeah she's just uh i don't know does she how often does she come out with them i probably have missed the last few since i've been back in school well no it seems like she doesn't write as often as oh well like Danielle Steele and those silly things she writes the same thing oh well she can she can turn them out overnight i swear yeah and and they're the same silly things i mean if you've read one there i mean it's you know it's yeah i've never read a whole one of hers i don't think it it's practically the same thing over and over you know and think how rich she is yeah wouldn't i you know i'm criticizing her and wouldn't i like to have her money oh yeah you know because they go from hardback to paperback and she has millions of them um-hum and then make movies out of some of them or you know miniseries and so forth but i seems to me like Susan Howatch does not write as often i have not seen as many of hers right well hers are so involved and they're and so such a higher intellectual level because she quotes a lot you know um-hum i think she does a lot of research too i do too so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular writers but oh her books are just incredible i don't think they've ever made a movie do you huh-uh yeah no i don't think so and i've often wondered why haven't you you know i yes well no uh i really just thought about it now but there's just maybe it's because they take so much in i don't know yeah um-hum maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them you know um-hum they're so big they're such you know it would be like another Gone with the Wind i guess a three hour movie um-hum yeah well and maybe that turns people off but look at Gone with the Wind you know oh i know it's about one of my favorite movies uh have you uh gotten into Scarlett yet no it had such a bad press i wasn't too intrigued i yeah that's exactly what i was gonna say i was amazed because i in the beginning when it was on you know on route coming out i heard mixed publicity you know kind of good and bad um-hum right and then when it came out all i heard was just uh how bad it was that i didn't even wanna get it me either do you know anyone that's read it hum-um no i haven't heard of anybody that's read it either but it was i think it was on the best-seller list though for a while no well it wouldn't surprise me  about the weather uh oh yes uh very appropriate i guess uh you ready for this yeah okay John just a moment well guess what we get to talk about the weather uh the weather is uh this time of year has actually been kind of unusual i've expected it to be colder until you know what we've gotten last couple days uh-huh i don't know i i fly for a living and i've uh the weather's been terribly unusual every where i've been oh you do so you you you probably go everywhere and have all sorts of weather and imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather yeah yeah yeah that way it was around here last night i'll tell you that well actually i'm i've i've heard on the news that we uh will be setting a record here in the state of Texas for the uh large amounts of rain and moisture we've had this year that it's gonna break all kind of records that were set set set back since nineteen thirty two no kidding so yeah if it uh keeps on raining like this and i understand it's supposed to rain until Saturday night hm Saturday or Sunday they were saying yeah oh yes so we're gonna yeah i know the systems have been real strong out i went through uh Phoenix on twice on uh Wednesday morning uh-huh and uh shot approaches to low minimum it was both both times you know and Phoenix never gets that kind of weather wow so well so are you an airline pilot yes i am with Southwest yeah yep oh great with Southwest fantastic i have a brother i have a brother that's a pilot also with American yeah yeah oh is that right yes and so i imagine you uh oh with all this kind of weather it's uh makes it kind of dangerous for you well now i no i wouldn't call it danger this is uh this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime oh i guess so yeah you know the the the air systems are reasonably calm you don't have uh the turbulence you know you little bit of chop but it's not like it is in the spring time um-hum oh yes well we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain so spectacular is the right word for them pardon me spectacular is a good word for them i've never seen a thunder show like i've seen down here before in in Texas it's amazing lights up the whole sky and even on a on a actually i've i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky it's a cloudless night and the rain isn't falling but you can see the thunder and lightning excuse me see the lightning going horizontally across the sky and and back and forth and what a light show it's it's fabulous oh yeah yeah yeah cloud to cloud it can be real really sensational here yes yes that's true yeah really where you from originally i'm from uh northern Utah and that's a very arid climate from uh Salt Lake City area um-hum and there's always a lot of snow in fact where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to uh twelve different major ski resorts and so there was an awful lot of snow and because it was an arid climate the snow was always a crisp powder light snow oh oh yeah which made it fantastic for skiing and and sleigh riding and everything else so we had a great time and oh oh yeah yeah were you near Park they were near the Park Cities area um yeah yeah that's beautiful area in a in Snowbird and Solitude and um-hum and Brighton and yes all those areas so i imagine have you skied before well we've skied i have not skied that area i've driven through it several times uh i've skied we skied California a bunch when we lived out there and um-hum um-hum and uh um and of course grew we grew up in Minnesota and we do some skiing there oh yes oh yes lot of cross country skiing there yeah great well do you think this the the weather is typical for this time of the year well not really i you know Minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow um the uh the um uh we've getting a fair amount of rain for this time of year already i i think and uh i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today you know that moved in last night yes yeah yeah it's been it's been cold there was a time though in the uh middle part of November that got really cool really really unseasonably cool yeah yes it did and then it warmed right back up and i thought great and that's yeah yeah that's a fun thing yeah uh my wife was just listening here and she said yeah it froze in fact yeah it was it was real cold that was that was very unseasonable for us down here and uh but uh i've really enjoyed the weather down here too because uh two years ago we were the day after Christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather weather and it's not as severe i should say as the weather that i've experienced up in northern Utah yeah oh yeah that's that's real true same with us from Minnesota it's it's uh in fact i've i played golf on the first on the New Year's Day one year down here you know it was yeah yeah not in Minnesota no no no no i have a brother-in-law that lives in Minnesota and they say boy six months out of the year it's bitter cold and oh it is it is and the wind and the blowing snow and everything it's well and they've had uh you know usually in Minnesota they get their snow in January and uh February um-hum and they're up over sixty five or sixty  do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last ten then Beverly i think one of the thing that i notice a lot i know it's touching social changes but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable and i i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction but i notice things on TV being more um open more i i believe that they portray things on TV obviously that they never would've years ago and you know and specifically nudity things like that um i i don't know i i've said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years they'll have just full nudity on TV and nobody'll think anything of it and to me that's surprising to me that's that's a big change to accept it and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that you know when they go uh one step further you don't notice it that much so that's one of the biggest ones i've seen huh yeah that's a big one what about you well i think that society has come to a point where they're they're not responsible for any of their actions somebody else uh made them do it uh that's what i seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices it's rather sue these guys because they made a faulty uh a seat belt that didn't work right or um-hum well that's what i think is a big one but i tend to agree with you and i think there's a lot of that um ah yeah we have become lawsuit happy any little thing it's like let's see what i can get don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from um oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it you know kind of like disregard to others do what makes you happy and and yes we should take care of ourselves you know and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others um i don't know i think it's come to that a lot i see it a lot in my daughter i have a four year old and uh-huh hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through but whenever something happens it's you made me hit that you made me do this and so i try to tell her Brianna everything isn't always somebody else's fault you know you have to watch where you're going and and so it's what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her sure so yeah and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is uh the roles that men and women play that's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly i think you're right um in your opinion good or bad or both well both you know there's some great things that uh have come about with more equality but i think that also i don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because i think that's bad for us i do too i think part of that i i don't know i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like in in terms of their self confident confidence their self-worth you know i can do something i can be somebody you know if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too and i think that's good but um i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the women's lib movement i think it was too extreme um um-hum i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think there's definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family maybe it's because of the the the social changes i don't know the fact that ah during their early changes where you know women did come more speak maybe maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of men were threatened by that i think now less men are you know because they're used to it it's around them um um-hum but i i don't know i i i don't know why the families are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know i'll stick with it while it's good and then i'll get out and i i i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment yeah i would agree with you ah so  well do you like to sail i used to sail quite a bit when i was younger and i haven't sailed much recently but i do like it i do like it how about yourself yeah well that oh i love to sail i have a i was first introduced to it when i was in Atlanta oh gosh in the late seventies i had a neighbor who had a little seventeen foot day sailor that we used to go out on Lake Lanier north of Atlanta just about every weekend in the summertime uh-huh and it was just more fun than a barrel of monkeys and just loved it and then uh i i don't know it i had never sailed before and i took to it like the yeah how old were you at that time um that was um twenty five or so uh-huh uh-huh and then i was transferred to Houston and as luck would have it uh one of my cohorts at work uh was partner uh with another guy who had a forty two foot uh Tarten as a matter of fact he still has it and so i got to go sailing a lot uh wow on that we've been down to Corpus and over to um i've been on the Pensacola yacht race and just in a whole little bit of gulf sailing and uh it's spectacular um i just it's one of my favorite very favorite things to do what's it like sailing on the gulf in um Corpus well once you get out is it pretty rough well now sure i've been whenever it was just horrendous i mean when we went out in storms and then again i've been out there whenever it's just almost you know just real light light waves i mean it's it's varied from one extreme to the other but whenever you get out away from the shoreline out in the blue water and the you know the dolphin start swimming along beside the boat and it uh it's wonderful oh wow that's something and of course that's the best of all possible worlds because i don't have to pay upkeep on it or any because honey you know that that there's a saying what's a sailboat it's a hole in the water that you throw money into i've never heard that one i suppose that's probably true so yeah well uh the guy the guy my friend who owns the boat that's what he professes that he said yeah then he said forty two foot boat is probably quite a investment yeah it is yeah it really is and uh he also says uh uh sailing is is uh a way to go uh nowhere fast to go to go nowhere at very slow speeds at very great expense but then you know there's something so much more magical about sailing as opposed to other kinds of boating i feel like um i don't know if it's a matter of the speed or if it's just the fact that you have a little bit more control at the tiller than you do say if you're in a power boat well oh yeah and i agree with you a hundred percent i mean i have after having sailed a little bit i just have no interest at all in a power boat and almost seems like it would be slightly boring yeah and it's just you know the whole idea of getting out there and uh making you know fine tuning the sails and trimming and and adjusting just to to eke out a little more speed from the wind uh-huh uh-huh yes yes and uh just have and i don't know just the whole you you you well and you're closer to nature too than having a big throbbing engine behind you more of a challenge um-hum um-hum and uh i i really do love it i've got uh um my company uh has some a facility in Aruba and i'm going down there in uh this spring and i hope to get a chance to do a little sailing down there beautiful clear water down there i'm sure exactly yeah yeah that's wonderful so one of the things i think i may even try is uh uh you know the the little sail board with the what they call it oh where you're standing like a surf board only there's a wind sailing yeah whatever but uh-huh uh-huh i don't you know i'm not quite sure if i'm ready to try that or not i i almost tried that once with a on a Club Med vacation yeah but um they had these other flat they weren't flat actually they were um probably eight to ten foot little skiffs that were a lot more fun so i went where my experience was yeah yeah and i i have heard people talk that that uh you know you almost have to have lessons and then it's really you know not easy to master those uh those uh-huh it looks challenging physically challenging it really it really does but again it looks like something that looks how it maybe like roller skating would be it looks like a lot of fun but not that easy to do uh-huh uh-huh have you ever surfed no i never have that might be the same sort of muscles that you'd use but yeah right or skied those are also if your muscles are developed there then uh-huh it wouldn't be as difficult as it might be for some other people yeah right right but uh anyway that's uh sort of the the extent of my water sports but i i do i find sailing just to be uh one of the best ways for me to get out and relax and uh-huh have you ever considered uh either buying in with someone else a partnership in a boat or yeah yeah i have considered it and at the same time it's um where i live in Houston it's in order to to really get the use out of it i would need to move down near Clear Clear Lake closer to the water i see and uh that would mean commuting up the Gulf Freeway every morning into downtown and and i'm i live so close to the office that i'm just not yeah yeah i don't know the idea of having to commute on a freeway in Houston every day even as much as i would like to have access to a boat you know more often than i do yeah it's it's just not that yeah that's a trade off certainly  up in New York freezing is it dry or wet um it's um it's it's been pretty dry yeah it it rained but we had a problem with a little bit of a water shortage but it rained for a bit but the last about three four days i guess you probably had a cold front last week but uh they said that it was coming across the country but the last few days has been like really cold it was down to about thirteen degrees um yesterday morning when i woke up it's starting to warm up a little bit now but we haven't got any snow yet just a couple of sprinkles here and there well we haven't had cold weather we've just had rain and rain and more rain this is our third consecutive day of rain and the weather man is promising us at least four more days of rain is it you say in Dallas yeah in Dallas and we're on the verge and it's going to happen either today or tomorrow of setting an all time record for most rain in a year wow our normal rainfall is twenty nine inches and we're already up to over fifty inches wow that's wild and it's and it's coming down and coming down it's it is been raining all year at an incredible pace that's pretty wild i know we're about to float away it's usually pretty i guess twenty nine is pretty dry it's Dallas is kind of in the desert huh well it's not really in desert the desert starts about fifty miles west of here is where the desert sort of starts but twenty nine inches is is our normal we have very dry summers and uh spring time is usually fairly wet but this time of year is fairly dry and we're having spring time rain right now well how how cold has it been oh it's uh pretty warm it's about fifty three degrees or so uh so it's not cold but it's just wet yeah i lived in Oregon for three years so i know what that's about what is it warm but wet up there yeah i used to it wasn't super warm during the winter it would be you know forty five fifty degrees most of the time but always a sprinkling type rain uh in New York you get when it rains you get like real showers sometimes you never got that out there but uh but here it it it rains about forty i guess about forty two forty two inches a year yeah i know we had a little bit of a a drought this year as a matter of fact because the water supply in our reservoirs was a little low well we're not having any problem like that the last time we had drought around here was nineteen eighty when we really got very little rain but since then it's been normal and then this is about the fourth year in a row where we've had above average rain last year we had about forty five inches and which is well above and now what we're having this year so it's been tremendous rainfall does it do any damage i mean you have floods or anything like that or uh some areas have had some flooding the worst flooding occurs in the spring time when some when our main river around here the Trinity River goes over its banks and causes damage but uh for the most part they've been trying to deal with that although the traffic is horrible when it rains when it rains oh yes everything comes to a a standstill with the rain this morning it took me thirty minutes extra to get to work yeah yeah yeah i found that i used to commute i used to live in New York City and commute out to Long Island which is in the suburbs and uh it was normally about an hour and fifteen minutes hour and a half drive it'd take there was really a lot of traffic but it was like pretty good flowing traffic and then it would get really bad when when it rain together you know takes whatever is your is your weather now normal for this time of year or is it different uh yeah it's pretty normal today is pretty normal today it's probably about thirty thirty five degree well maybe thirty degrees out now and it's supposed to go up to forty and then that's about normal we don't we don't usually stay below freezing uh for long periods of time uh you know we have cold spells that that happen but but aside from that usually the temperature probably average temperature is thirty five forty degrees during the winter so this is kind of normal well we had we had early freezes here we had our a normal freeze is around November twentieth and we had our freeze this year on November second and between the second and the tenth of November in those eight days we set record lows six of eight days and so we thought we were going to really have a cold winter but since then it's the temperatures have been normal it's just that the rain has been incredible yeah that's what happened here last year we had we had uh a lot of cold early on and then it and then the winter was relatively mild i think they i think it's going to be a cold winter this year though because of that volcano in uh oh in the Philippines in the Philippines that's supposed to like cover up the uh or rather raise the warming layers and stuff like that so it's probably going to be a couple degrees cooler well i don't know what i don't know if that volcano caused all this rain but something's been causing all this rain but uh it could it could it could cause rain i'm not sure but
